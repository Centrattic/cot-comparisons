      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for leaving their daughter's friend at the park. \n\nFirst, the details: The author was picking up their daughter from the park after work. When they arrived, the daughter's friend was there and wanted a ride home. The author declined and only took their daughter home. The time was around 6 PM.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether it's wrong to not offer a ride to the friend. Let me think about possible angles. \n\nParental responsibility: The author is the parent, so their primary obligation is to their own child. The friend isn't their responsibility. Unless there's an expectation that the parent should help others' kids, which might depend on cultural norms or prior arrangements.\n\nPrior arrangements: The question doesn't mention if the friend was supposed to be picked up by the author. If the friend regularly gets rides from the author's house, maybe there's an unspoken agreement. But since the friend is the daughter's friend, the parent might not have any obligation unless they've agreed to do so.\n\nSafety and well-being: It's 6 PM, so the friend is left at the park. Is the park a safe place? If the park is in a bad area, leaving someone there could be an issue. But the question doesn't mention safety concerns. The friend could have other means of getting home, like public transport, biking, or walking if it's a safe neighborhood.\n\nIntentions of the parent: The parent was going to pick up their own daughter. The friend wasn't expected, so the parent might not feel responsible. It's about whether there's an expectation. If the parent knew in advance that the friend needed a ride, maybe they should have arranged something. But in this case, it seems like an unexpected situation.\n\nSocial norms: Sometimes, parents might help other kids if it's convenient. But if it's not convenient, is it wrong to decline? The parent might not want to take on additional responsibility without prior agreement. \n\nPossible arguments against the parent: The friend might be in a situation where they can't get home otherwise, especially if it's dark at 6 PM. But again, the question doesn't specify if the friend had other options. If the friend is a teenager, they might have a phone to call someone else. \n\nOn the other hand, the parent isn't responsible for the friend's transportation unless they agreed to it. The parent's primary duty is to their own child. So, unless there's a prior agreement or a safety issue, the parent isn't in the wrong for not offering a ride.\n\nSo, the parent isn't necessarily wrong. The answer would be B (No).\n"
