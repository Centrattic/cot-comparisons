      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The situation is about them leaving their daughter's friend at the park when the friend asked for a ride home.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The parent went to the park to pick up their daughter. When they arrived, the daughter's friend was there and wanted a ride home. The parent declined. The key points here are: it was around 6 PM, and the parent only came to pick up their own daughter.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. Why might that be? Maybe because the friend expected a ride home, and the parent didn't offer help. But the parent's responsibility is to their daughter. The friend isn't their child, so they aren't obligated to provide transportation. However, the parent might be expected to be considerate, especially if the friend was relying on them. But maybe there's no prior arrangement. If the parent didn't know the friend needed a ride, then declining is understandable. Alternatively, if the parent usually helps the friend, that could change things.\n\nAlso, the time is 6 PM. Depending on the area, it might be getting dark, which could make leaving someone at the park risky. However, the parent might not have that responsibility unless they agreed to it. The parent's main duty was to their daughter. The friend should have made their own arrangements or informed the parent earlier. \n\nSo, is the parent wrong? If there was no obligation and the parent didn't agree to give a ride, then they're not at fault. The friend might have assumed the ride was part of the deal, but the parent wasn't required to. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
