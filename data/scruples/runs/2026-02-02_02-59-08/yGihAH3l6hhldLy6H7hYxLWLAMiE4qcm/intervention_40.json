      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong for leaving their daughter's friend at the park. The situation is that the parent went to pick up their daughter from the park, but there was the daughter's friend there who needed a ride home. The parent declined to give her a ride and only took their daughter home. The user thinks the parent is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The parent was picking up their own daughter, so their primary responsibility is to the child. The daughter's friend was not their child, so the parent isn't obligated to give a ride. However, maybe the friend expected the parent to offer a ride, especially if they were there. But the parent might have had reasons not to, like not wanting to take on extra responsibility or not knowing the friend well enough to trust. \n\nAlso, the time was around 6 PM. Maybe the friend's parents expected them to pick her up, but the parent didn't know that. If the friend needed a ride home and there was no other arrangement, the parent might have been expected to help. But without prior knowledge or agreement, is the parent responsible? The parent's obligation is to their own child. The friend's parents should be responsible for their child's transportation. \n\nAnother angle: maybe the daughter's friend was left in an unsafe situation. If the park is a secure place and the friend had other means of getting home, then it's not a problem. But if the friend was stranded and couldn't get home otherwise, maybe the parent should have offered a ride. However, the parent might not know if there are other options. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, usually, parents aren't expected to take responsibility for other children unless they were directly asked or made prior arrangements. So the parent might not be in the wrong. However, if the daughter's friend was left stranded because no one else was available, maybe the parent could be seen as not helping. But the parent isn't responsible for the friend's parent's negligence. \n\nThe key points are: was there an expectation for the parent to take the friend? Did the friend have other options? The parent's main duty is to their own child. If the friend's parents were supposed to pick her up but didn't, then the fault is on them. The parent might not be in the wrong for not knowing or not agreeing to take her. \n\nSo, in this case, the answer would be that the parent isn't in the wrong. They were doing their duty by their own child, and unless there was a prior agreement to take the friend, they can't be expected to help. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
