      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for leaving their daughter's friend at the park. The situation is that the parent went to pick up their daughter from the park, and the daughter's friend asked for a ride home, but the parent declined and only took their daughter.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The parent's primary responsibility is to their own child. They were going to pick up their daughter as agreed, and the daughter's friend was there. The parent might not have made any prior arrangements to take the friend home. The friend might have expected a ride since they came with the daughter, but the parent isn't necessarily obligated unless there was a prior agreement.\n\nTiming is also a factor. It was around 6 PM. The parent might have had plans or other commitments after picking up their daughter. Taking an extra child home could add time and responsibility. However, if the friend was left waiting and it's a regular occurrence, that could be an issue.\n\nAnother angle: the daughter might have a role here. If the daughter asked for the friend to come along and expected the parent to take both, but the parent wasn't informed, that's a different scenario. But the parent's post says they declined the friend, not that the daughter asked them to. So the parent might not have been aware the friend needed a ride until they arrived.\n\nLegal and ethical considerations: Parents aren't legally responsible for other children unless they've agreed to do so. Ethically, it's a gray area. If the friend was left stranded repeatedly, that could be seen as neglect, but a one-time incident might not be. Also, the parent's decision to prioritize their own child is understandable.\n\nPossible counterarguments: Some might say it's considerate to offer a ride if it's convenient. But if it's not a usual arrangement and the parent wasn't asked beforehand, maybe they aren't at fault. The friend might have been expected to have another way home.\n\nIn conclusion, the parent isn't necessarily in the wrong because they had no prior commitment to take the friend home. The friend should have arranged their own transportation. The answer is B.\n"
