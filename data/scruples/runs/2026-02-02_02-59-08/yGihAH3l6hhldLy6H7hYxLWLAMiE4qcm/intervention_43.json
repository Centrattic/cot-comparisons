      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person in question is being asked if they're at fault for leaving their daughter's friend at the park. The situation is that they went to pick up their daughter from the park, and when they arrived, the daughter's friend was there too and asked for a ride home. The parent declined the friend and only took their daughter. The time was around 6 PM when they picked up the daughter.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The parent's primary responsibility is their own child. They weren't obligated to give the friend a ride unless they had agreed to beforehand. However, sometimes parents might feel a social obligation, especially if the friend is also a minor. But the question is whether the parent was wrong in declining.\n\nPossible angles to consider: Did the parent have any prior agreement to take the friend? Was the friend expecting a ride? How old are the children? If the friend is a minor, maybe the parent should have ensured she gets home safely. But the parent might not have known the friend needed a ride unless the daughter informed them. The daughter might be responsible here if she didn't mention her friend's need. \n\nAlso, cultural norms: In some communities, it's expected to help others, but legally, the parent isn't responsible for the friend unless they had a prior agreement. The parent's duty is to their own child. So, maybe the parent isn't in the wrong. However, if the friend was left in a bad situation (like walking alone at night), that could be a factor. But the time was 6 PM, which in many places isn't that late, so maybe the friend could have walked home. \n\nThe key points are: 1. No prior agreement to take the friend. 2. The friend's responsibility to arrange her own transport. 3. The parent's obligation is to their own child. \n\nSo, based on these factors, the parent might not be in the wrong. Unless there's a specific reason the parent should have known or had a prior arrangement. Since the question states the parent declined and no prior info, the answer might be B (not in the wrong). But if the daughter should have mentioned her friend's need, that's on the daughter. The parent didn't know. So, probably B.\n"
