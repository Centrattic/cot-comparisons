      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for leaving their daughter's friend at the park. The situation is that the parent went to pick up their daughter from the park, and there was the daughter's friend there who needed a ride home. The parent declined to take the friend, then drove their daughter home. It was around six o'clock.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The parent was picking up their own daughter. The friend wanted a ride home, but the parent didn't offer. The question is whether this is wrong.\n\nI should think about common social norms. Parents often have a responsibility to their own children first. If the parent was already going to pick up their daughter, maybe the friend wasn't supposed to be picked up by them. Unless there was an arrangement beforehand, the parent isn't obligated to take the friend. However, maybe the friend expected it since they were with the daughter. But the parent might not have known the friend needed a ride unless the daughter mentioned it. \n\nAnother angle: Is it reasonable to assume that the parent should have taken the friend? If the friend was with the daughter, maybe the parent assumed they would find another way home. Or maybe the parent felt it was their daughter's responsibility to inform the friend about transportation. Alternatively, if the parent knew the friend needed a ride, not offering could be seen as neglectful, but if they weren't informed, then maybe not. \n\nTime is also a factor. It was six o'clock. If the friend was left alone at the park after dark, that could be a safety issue. But if the park is well-lit and safe, maybe not. Also, maybe the friend had other plans or other means of getting home. \n\nThe key points are: Did the parent know the friend needed a ride? Was there an expectation? Was it reasonable for the friend to assume the parent would take her? If the parent didn't know, then they aren't at fault. If they knew and refused without a valid reason, maybe they are. \n\nIn the story, the parent says the friend \"apparently\" needed a ride. The use of \"apparently\" suggests that the parent might not have been informed by the friend. Maybe the daughter didn't mention it, or the friend didn't ask. If the parent didn't know, then they can't be blamed for not helping. \n\nOn the other hand, if the friend was clearly waiting and needed help, the parent might be expected to offer assistance. But since the parent's main duty is to their own child, maybe it's not their responsibility. \n\nI think the answer depends on whether the parent had prior knowledge. Since the friend just \"apparently\" needed a ride, the parent might not have been aware. Therefore, they aren't in the wrong. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
