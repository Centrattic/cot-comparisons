      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for leaving their daughter's friend at the park. Let me start by reading through the situation again.\n\nThe parent was coming home from work and went to the park to pick up their daughter. When they arrived, the daughter's friend was there and asked for a ride home. The parent declined. Then they drove the daughter home, and it was around six o'clock when they picked her up.\n\nFirst, I should consider the parent's responsibility. They were picking up their own daughter, so their primary responsibility is to their child. The daughter's friend is a separate person, and unless the parent had previously agreed to take the friend home, there's no obligation. The parent might not have the time or resources to accommodate others, especially if they just got off work. \n\nBut wait, the daughter's friend could have been left stranded if it was late. However, the parent might have thought the friend could wait a bit or find another way home. But the parent didn't know that. Also, the friend might not have known the parent's transportation situation. \n\nAnother angle: was the parent aware that the friend needed a ride? The daughter might have mentioned it before, or maybe the friend asked upon arrival. If the parent didn't know about the need beforehand, they can't be blamed for not preparing. Also, the parent's main duty is to their own child, so prioritizing the daughter's pickup makes sense. \n\nBut maybe there's an expectation for parents to help friends in such situations. However, unless there's an agreement or a prior understanding, the parent isn't obligated. The friend probably should have arranged her own transportation. \n\nTime of day is 6 PM. Depending on the location, it might be getting dark, so leaving a teenager at the park could be a concern. But the parent might not be responsible for the friend's safety unless they volunteered to take her. \n\nThe key points are: the parent's responsibility is to their own child, there's no indication of prior agreement to take the friend, and the parent isn't in the wrong for not accommodating an unexpected request. \n\nSo the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
