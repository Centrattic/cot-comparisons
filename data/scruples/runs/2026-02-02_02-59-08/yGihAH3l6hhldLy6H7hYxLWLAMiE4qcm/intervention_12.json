      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong for leaving their daughter's friend at the park. The situation is that the parent went to pick up their daughter from the park, and the daughter's friend wanted a ride home too. The parent declined the friend and took only their daughter home. The time was around 6 PM.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The parent was coming home from work, so they might have been tired. The daughter wanted to be picked up, which is reasonable. The friend was there, asked for a ride, but the parent said no. The key here is whether there was an obligation for the parent to give the friend a ride.\n\nThe parent's primary responsibility is their own child. Unless there was a prior agreement or understanding that the parent would also pick up the friend, there's no inherent duty. The daughter's friend might have assumed the parent would take her, but the parent isn't necessarily responsible for the friend's transportation unless they agreed beforehand. \n\nAlso, safety is a factor. The parent might not know the friend well, so taking a stranger into their car could be a concern. But in this case, the friend is the daughter's friend, so maybe there's some level of trust. However, unless the parent had a specific reason to believe the friend wouldn't get home otherwise, refusing a ride once isn't necessarily wrong. \n\nAnother angle: maybe the friend was relying on the parent to get home, especially if it's getting dark (since it's 6 PM). But the parent's obligation is to their child. The daughter might have had a role here by not informing the friend that their parent wasn't picking her up. But the parent isn't at fault for not knowing the friend's transportation plans unless the daughter mentioned it. \n\nIs there any cultural expectation or norm here? In some places, parents might expect to help their child's friends, but it's not a strict rule. Since the parent didn't agree to the ride beforehand, they can't be blamed for declining. The friend might be expected to arrange her own transport next time, but that doesn't make the parent wrong for saying no in the moment.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the parent isn't necessarily in the wrong. They were fulfilling their duty to their child, and there's no indication they had a prior commitment to the friend. The answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
