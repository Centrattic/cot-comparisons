      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is at fault for leaving their daughter's friend at the park. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author was picking up their daughter from the park after work. They arrived around 6 PM. The daughter's friend was there and wanted a ride home, but the author declined. The key points here are: the author's primary responsibility was to their daughter, and the friend was not their child. \n\nSo, the parent's duty is to their own child. Unless there was a prior agreement or expectation that the parent would also take the friend home, it's reasonable for the parent to prioritize their daughter. The friend might not have realized that the parent wasn't responsible for her. Also, the parent might not know the friend's family situation or if there were other arrangements. \n\nBut maybe the friend thought that since the parent was picking up their daughter, they would take her too. However, the parent isn't obligated to do that unless they had agreed beforehand. Since the parent declined, and there's no indication of negligence or harm done, the parent isn't necessarily in the wrong. The friend might need to arrange her own transportation next time. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong because they weren't responsible for the friend. But I should check if there's any cultural or social expectations that might make this different. In some contexts, people might expect to help a friend in need, but legally and ethically, the parent isn't responsible for someone else's child unless there's a specific duty. So, B makes sense here.\n"
