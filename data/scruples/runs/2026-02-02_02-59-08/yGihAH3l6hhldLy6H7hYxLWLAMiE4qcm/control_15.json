      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is wrong here. The question is about whether it's wrong to leave the daughter's friend at the park. The user says they were coming home from work, picked up their daughter from the park, and the friend asked for a ride. They declined and went home. The time was around 6 PM.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The parent's responsibility is primarily to their own child. When they went to the park, their main purpose was to pick up their daughter. The daughter's friend was there and asked for a ride. The parent declined. But is that wrong?\n\nI think the key points here are consent and responsibility. The parent isn't obligated to give rides to others unless they've previously agreed. If the friend's parents didn't arrange for the parent to pick up their child, then the parent isn't responsible for the friend. Also, the parent might have had their own schedule\u2014coming home from work. Maybe they didn't have time, or they weren't comfortable transporting someone else without prior agreement.\n\nAnother angle: maybe the daughter's friend expected the parent to take her because she assumed that since they were picking up the daughter, they'd take her too. But the parent isn't necessarily responsible for the friend's transportation unless it was an understood arrangement. The parent might not want to take on that responsibility without knowing. Also, driving someone else's child without consent from the friend's parents could be risky legally or ethically.\n\nHowever, perhaps the parent could have offered to call the friend's parents or suggest another solution instead of just declining. But the parent might not have a phone with them, or might not know the friend's parents' contact info. The time was 6 PM, which is reasonable, but maybe the friend was left waiting. Still, the parent isn't at fault if they didn't have prior agreement.\n\nSo, putting it all together, I think the parent isn't in the wrong. They were fulfilling their duty to their own child. Declining to transport another child without prior arrangement is reasonable. The friend's parents should have arranged transportation for their child. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
