      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for leaving their daughter's friend at the park. The situation is that they went to pick up their daughter, found her friend there who wanted a ride home, but they declined. The time was around 6 PM.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The parent's main responsibility is their daughter. They were going to pick her up, so maybe they didn't have the capacity or intention to take another child. But the daughter's friend was there, expecting a ride? Did the parent know beforehand that the friend needed a ride? Probably not, since they declined when they arrived.\n\nIs there an expectation that parents should help others' kids? Maybe not necessarily. The parent isn't the friend's parent, so they might not be obligated. However, maybe the daughter knew her friend needed a ride and expected her parent to help. If the parent declined, did they leave the friend stranded? That could be an issue if the friend had no other way home, but the story doesn't say. It just says the friend \"apparently needed a ride,\" but the parent said no.\n\nAlso, the time was 6 PM. Depending on the location, it might be dark or not. If the friend was left alone in a park at that time, maybe there's a safety concern. But again, the story doesn't specify if the friend was left alone or if there were other options.\n\nThe parent might feel they were within their rights to only take their own child. But if the daughter's friend was dependent on her for transportation, maybe the daughter should have arranged for that beforehand. The parent might not be at fault here because they weren't aware of the friend's situation until arriving. \n\nSo, considering all that, the parent's decision to decline seems reasonable. They weren't responsible for the friend. Unless there's more context, like prior agreements or safety issues, the parent isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
