      "text": "Okay, let's see. The question is whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong for leaving their daughter's friend at the park. The situation is that the parent went to pick up their daughter from the park, and when the daughter's friend asked for a ride home, the parent declined. They drove their daughter home, and it was around six o'clock.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The parent's primary responsibility is to their own child. They were going to pick up their daughter, so it's reasonable that their main focus was on that. The daughter's friend might have been expecting a ride, but the parent isn't necessarily obligated to provide one unless there was an agreement beforehand.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's an assumption that because the friend was with the daughter, the parent might be expected to help. However, unless the parent had prior knowledge or agreed to take the friend, declining isn't necessarily wrong. Also, the time was six PM, which might be when the friend's parents expect her home. If the parent didn't know the friend needed a ride, they can't be blamed for not offering. But if the friend had asked and the parent just said no, maybe the parent should have considered alternatives, like calling the friend's parents or offering to drop her off somewhere else.\n\nWait, but the parent only came to pick up their daughter. Maybe the friend was left there intentionally? If the daughter's friend was supposed to be picked up by someone else, but the parent didn't know, then the parent isn't at fault. However, if the friend was left there and the parent could have reasonably known that she needed a ride, then maybe there's some responsibility. But the key point is that the parent's main duty is to their own child. Unless there's a prior arrangement or legal responsibility towards the friend, declining isn't wrong. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
