      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post) is in the wrong for leaving their daughter's friend at the park. The situation is that the parent went to pick up their daughter from the park, found the daughter's friend there needing a ride home, but declined to give her a ride and just took their daughter home. It was around 6 PM.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The parent's primary responsibility is their own child. They were coming home from work, so maybe they were tired or had other commitments. The daughter wanted to be picked up, so the parent came to get her. The friend was there and needed a ride home. The parent declined. Now, the question is whether that was wrong.\n\nPossible angles: Did the parent have any prior obligation to give the friend a ride? If the friend was expecting to be picked up, maybe the parent had an implied responsibility. But the parent's main duty is to their child. Also, maybe the friend should have arranged her own transportation. However, if the friend is a minor, there might be a different expectation. Wait, the daughter is the parent's child, so the friend's age is probably similar. If the friend is a minor, leaving her at the park without a ride home could be a problem, especially in the evening. But the parent might not be responsible for the friend unless they had agreed to help beforehand.\n\nAnother point: Was the parent aware that the friend needed a ride? If the friend asked, the parent could have said they couldn't help. But if the parent just left without offering any assistance, maybe that's different. Also, the time was 6 PM, which might be considered evening, so leaving a child there alone could be an issue. But the parent might not have known that the friend was there. The daughter might have known and maybe even arranged for the ride, but the parent didn't know.\n\nAlso, cultural norms might play a role. In some places, it's expected to help others, even if it's not a direct responsibility. However, the parent is not a legal guardian of the friend, so they aren't obligated to take her home. The friend's parents should be responsible for her transportation. If the friend is in a situation where she can't get home, that's a problem, but the parent isn't necessarily at fault here unless they had prior knowledge or agreed to help.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The parent's main duty is to their own child. They came to pick up their daughter as agreed. The friend needing a ride wasn't their responsibility unless they had agreed beforehand. Therefore, the parent isn't in the wrong for declining. But maybe the parent could have offered to call the friend's parents or suggest a solution, but declining the ride itself isn't necessarily wrong. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
