      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for leaving their daughter's friend at the park. \n\nFirst, the situation: The parent was coming home from work and picked up their daughter from the park. When they arrived, there was the daughter's friend there who needed a ride home. The parent declined to give her a ride and then went home. The time was around six when they picked up the daughter.\n\nSo, the key points here are whether the parent had an obligation to give the friend a ride. The friend needed a ride, but the parent wasn't responsible for her. The parent's primary responsibility is to their own child. The daughter asked to be picked up, so the parent went to get her. The friend just happened to be there and asked for a ride. \n\nIn most cases, unless there's a prior agreement or the parent has some responsibility towards the friend (like being a parent figure or a guardian), they aren't obligated to provide transportation. The parent isn't at fault for choosing to pick up their own child and not taking on an extra responsibility they didn't know about beforehand. \n\nThe daughter's friend needed a ride, but the parent didn't make her stay at the park. The friend could have waited until someone else could give her a ride. There's no indication that the parent was aware of the friend needing a ride in advance or had any role in organizing her transportation. \n\nHowever, some might argue that the parent could have offered to drop the friend off after picking up their daughter, but the parent didn't have to do that. The parent's main duty is to their child, and not everyone is responsible for everyone else's transportation. \n\nSo, considering all that, the parent isn't in the wrong because they weren't responsible for the friend's transportation and had no prior obligation. The correct answer should be B (No).\n"
