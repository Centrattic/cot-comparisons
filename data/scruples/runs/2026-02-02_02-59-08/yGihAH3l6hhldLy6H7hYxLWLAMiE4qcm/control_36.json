      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the parent went to pick up their daughter from the park. When they arrived, the daughter's friend was there too, and she needed a ride home. The parent declined her, then took their daughter home. It was around 6 PM.\n\nFirst, I need to consider what's expected. Parents usually have the right to decide whom they transport. If the friend was not a family member and the parent didn't have any prior agreement to take her, then the parent isn't obligated. Maybe the friend just assumed they could get a ride, but the parent wasn't responsible for her. Also, the parent's main responsibility is their own child. They might not be comfortable picking up others without knowing their situation. There's also the aspect of safety\u2014unannounced passengers can be a concern. The parent might have had good reasons, like not wanting to be responsible for someone else or not knowing the friend well. On the other hand, if the friend was expecting a ride and it was a regular thing, maybe the parent should have considered. But in the given info, there's no mention of prior arrangements. So the parent probably isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
