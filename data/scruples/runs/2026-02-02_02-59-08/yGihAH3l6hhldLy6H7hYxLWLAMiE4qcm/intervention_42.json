      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for leaving their daughter's friend at the park. The situation is that the mom went to pick up her daughter from the park, and the daughter's friend wanted a ride home too, but the mom declined. The key points here are the context and expectations.\n\nFirst, the mom was picking up her daughter after work. It was 6 PM, so probably an after-school activity. The daughter's friend needed a ride home. The mom refused. Now, the question is whether that refusal was wrong.\n\nI need to consider if there's an obligation here. If the mom had previously agreed to pick up the friend, then declining would be in the wrong. But the scenario doesn't mention that. It just says the friend \"apparently needed a ride home.\" So maybe the friend assumed that the mom would give her a ride, but the mom didn't have any prior agreement. \n\nAlso, the mom's primary responsibility is her daughter. If she didn't have any prior commitment to the friend, then declining might be reasonable. However, if the daughter expected her mom to help her friend, then the mom might be at fault. But again, the information given is limited. \n\nAnother angle: maybe the daughter asked the mom to take her friend. If the daughter asked and the mom refused, that could imply the mom is in the wrong. But the scenario doesn't specify that. The mom just declined the friend. \n\nSocial expectations might play a role here. If the friend was waiting for a ride and the mom was there, some people might expect her to offer a ride, but it's not a legal obligation. It's more a social courtesy. The mom might be in the right if she didn't feel responsible, especially if there was no prior agreement. \n\nBut then again, if the daughter's friend was relying on her to get home, not offering help could be seen as inconsiderate. However, the mom's main responsibility is her daughter. \n\nThe answer depends on whether there was an expectation. If the friend didn't ask before, the mom isn't wrong. If the daughter arranged for the mom to pick up her friend, then the mom might be at fault. Since the scenario is unclear on these points, but the mom just declined without prior agreement, I think the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
