      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for leaving their daughter's friend at the park. The situation is that the parent went to pick up their daughter from the park, and the daughter's friend asked for a ride home, but the parent declined. The time was around 6 PM.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The parent's primary responsibility is their own child. They were going to pick up their daughter, which is a reasonable expectation. The friend's presence at the park might not have been planned, and the parent might not have been aware beforehand that the friend needed a ride. \n\nNow, is there an obligation to give someone else a ride? If the friend is a minor, maybe there's an expectation that a parent or guardian would help, but since the parent isn't the friend's parent, does that obligation exist? If the friend's parents didn't arrange for a ride, maybe the friend should have made other arrangements. However, the parent might have felt it was their daughter's responsibility to ensure her friend gets home safely, but that's not necessarily the case.\n\nAlso, the parent might not have the capacity to take the friend, especially if the car isn't large enough or if they're only going to the daughter's home. But the parent could have offered to drive the friend to a nearby location or suggested alternative plans. However, the parent isn't legally obligated to do so unless there's a specific agreement.\n\nAnother angle: the parent might have a duty of care if they knew the friend was unattended. But if the park is public and the friend was there with the daughter, maybe the friend's parents are responsible. The parent's main responsibility is their own child. Declining the ride doesn't necessarily make them wrong, as they can't be expected to take on the responsibility of another child unless they volunteered to do so.\n\nIn terms of social norms, sometimes people expect others to help, but it's not mandatory. The parent might be seen as inconsiderate, but not in the wrong. It's a judgment call. The key is whether the parent acted unreasonably. Since they were picking up their daughter and the friend's need wasn't anticipated, the parent isn't necessarily at fault. So the answer is B (No).\n"
