      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for leaving their daughter's friend at the park. The scenario is that the parent went to pick up their daughter, found the daughter's friend there who needed a ride home, and declined her. The parent then took their daughter home, and it was around 6 PM when they picked up the daughter.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The parent was going to pick up their daughter, so the main purpose of the trip was to get the daughter. The daughter's friend needed a ride home, but the parent didn't offer to drive her. The question is whether this is wrong.\n\nOne angle is that the parent wasn't obligated to pick up the friend. The friend's need for a ride might not be the parent's responsibility. Parents usually don't have to take other people's kids home unless there's some prior agreement or emergency. The parent might not have had time or the intention to do that, especially if they were just going to pick up their own child.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the friend was left stranded, especially if it was getting late (6 PM). Depending on the location, 6 PM might be when it's getting dark or if there are safety concerns. If the friend had no other means of transportation, the parent might be seen as inconsiderate or neglectful. But the parent might argue that it wasn't their responsibility and they were focused on their own daughter.\n\nAlso, the daughter's friend might expect some help, especially if they were together at the park. But the parent could have reasonably thought that their duty was to their own child. There's a difference between being polite and being obligated. The parent didn't do something harmful, but maybe didn't offer help when it was possible.\n\nIn terms of social norms, people often help others when they can, but it's not always a requirement. The parent might have had a valid reason, like not wanting to stay longer, or not knowing the friend well enough to feel responsible. Alternatively, if the friend had to wait until 6 PM and then was left, maybe the parent should have offered to drop her off on the way home, even if it was a slight detour.\n\nI need to think about if there's any indication that the friend was in danger or that the parent was aware of that. The prompt doesn't mention any emergencies, just that the friend needed a ride. If the parent knew the friend had no other way home, maybe they should have helped. But if the friend just thought she needed a ride but could have walked or found another way, then the parent isn't at fault.\n\nAlso, the parent might not have been informed about the friend needing a ride until arrival. The daughter might not have mentioned it earlier. The parent's decision to decline could be based on not wanting to make a detour or not wanting to take on additional responsibility.\n\nIn many cases, people consider helping others when possible, but it's not always mandatory. Unless there's a prior agreement or legal obligation, the parent isn't necessarily wrong for not offering. However, from a social standpoint, some might argue that the parent could have been more considerate. But the parent's main duty is to their own child.\n\nSo, considering all factors, I think the answer is B, the parent is not in the wrong. They weren't obligated to take the friend home, and their primary responsibility was to their daughter. There's no indication of negligence or harm caused to the friend by declining.\n"
