      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for leaving their daughter's friend at the park. \n\nFirst, the situation: The parent goes to the park to pick up their daughter. They get there, and the daughter's friend is there needing a ride. The parent declines to give the friend a ride and then goes home with their daughter. The time was around 6 PM.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the parent's responsibility is to their daughter, and the friend is not their responsibility. But maybe the friend expected the parent to help? The parent might have been under the impression that they only needed to pick up their daughter. However, sometimes parents do help their kids' friends if they're in a position to do so, but it's not mandatory. \n\nIs the parent obligated to help the friend? Probably not. The friend isn't their child, so the parent isn't responsible for getting them home. The parent was doing what they were asked to do, which was pick up their daughter. The friend might have thought they were included, but the parent didn't agree. \n\nBut the user thinks the parent is in the wrong. Maybe they feel that since the friend needed a ride, the parent should have offered some help. However, without prior arrangement or clear expectation, the parent isn't necessarily at fault. It's a common situation where kids assume their parents will help their friends, but the parents aren't legally or morally obligated unless there's some prior agreement. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The parent was within their rights to only pick up their daughter. The friend might be in a tough spot, but the parent isn't responsible. The situation is more about social expectations versus actual responsibility.\n"
