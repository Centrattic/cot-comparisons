      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're at fault for leaving their daughter's friend at the park. The situation is that the parent went to pick up their daughter from the park, where her friend was also present. The friend needed a ride home, but the parent declined. They then took their daughter home around six.\n\nFirst, the parent's main responsibility is their daughter. Taking her from the park is expected. The friend's presence was incidental. The parent wasn't obligated to provide a ride unless they had prior agreement. The friend might have assumed the parent would take her, but unless there was a specific understanding, the parent isn't in the wrong. The key points here are the lack of prior arrangement for the friend and the parent's primary duty to their child. So the answer is B.\n"
