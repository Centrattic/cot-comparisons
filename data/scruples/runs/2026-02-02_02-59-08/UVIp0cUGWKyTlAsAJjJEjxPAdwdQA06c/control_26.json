The party started first as a small gathering of friends drinking beer, eating pizza, watching movies. Someone posted on our grad Facebook page about this gathering and before I knew it there were like 50-60 people over smoking weed, drinking vodka and a bunch of other shit. I\u2019m not a smoker or drinker, so I left pretty quickly. My friend, who\u2019s also a grade 12 but was 16 at the time of this event, stayed. \n\nNow I\u2019m back home, reading, watching TV whatever. I\u2019m been on my phone, watching people Snapchat and Instagram\u2019s stories. In one, my friend is the focus where she\u2019s chugging a bottle of vodka, in another she\u2019s smoking a joint and in a third, she\u2019s doing shots with a guy. I know that she drove to the party so I text her to call an Uber. When she doesn\u2019t reply, I call her. She picks up and complains that Uber\u2019s too expensive so I offer to call one for her. She hangs up after saying she\u2019s fine to drive. \n\nMaybe 30 minutes later, I see on one of her friend\u2019s Snapchat story, like 5 different videos of her in the car, driving while smoking and drinking and texting on her phone and one video of them in a Macdonald\u2019s that was posted like 2 mins ago. \n\nI call my friend\u2019s mom and tell her what\u2019s happening. She says thanks and hangs up. I don\u2019t hear from her or her daughter for the rest of the night. \n\nShe\u2019s not at school the next day but I hear from from my friends and classmates that her mom and dad grounded her, taking away her phone for like 6 months and selling her car. All day, I had people, mostly her friends and other classmates who\u2019ve posted videos of themselves drinking and doing drugs, (hell one of the girls was a 16 who has a tinder account and who keeps a bottle of vodka in her locker) coming up to me and calling me a dick and an asshole and a bitch for calling her mom on her when she was just having some harmless fun. \n\nNow this was literally the same day when we had a MADD presentation at school. \n\nThe following day, she\u2019s back at school and the first thing she does when she sees me is punch me and call me a \u201cfucking life ruining asshole\u201d because on top of no phone and goodbye car, her parents aren\u2019t letting her attend any house parties and are considering not letting her go to after-prom. \n\nWas I the asshole for doing this? Because honestly, I kinda feel I am. I mean if something had happened and her car crashed and they died and I hadn\u2019t done anything, I\u2019d feel guilty for not doing anything. But now I feel guilty because I got her in trouble with her parents. And we used to be really good friends but in the last month, since she punched me, we haven\u2019t talked at all which kinda hurts. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author called their friend's mom because they saw her driving under the influence after a party. The friend was 16 at the time, and the author is 17. The friend was doing risky things like drinking, smoking, and texting while driving, which the author found out through social media. The author tried to get her to call an Uber but she refused. Then the author called her mom, leading to the friend getting grounded and losing her phone and car. The friend punched the author, and other classmates are upset with them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In many places, the legal drinking age is 21, so a 16-year-old drinking is underage. Driving under the influence is illegal regardless of age. The author's actions could be seen as preventing a potential accident or saving lives. However, the author didn't have legal authority to do that; they just called the parent. \n\nThen there's the moral aspect. The author was concerned about their friend's safety and others on the road. It's a risky situation, and the friend was being reckless. But by calling her mom, the author caused immediate consequences for the friend, leading to punishment. The friend's reaction was physical aggression, which is bad, but does that make the author wrong?\n\nThe friends at school are upset and call the author names, but they were also involved in similar risky behavior. The author's friends might be in denial about their own actions. The author's intention was to prevent harm, which is a good motive. However, the method of involving a parent without discussing it first might have been harsh. The author didn't give the friend a chance to explain or make a better choice themselves, but the situation was urgent.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the friend is clearly at fault for driving under the influence. The author acted to stop a dangerous situation. The parents' reaction grounded the friend, which is a consequence of her own actions. The author might feel guilt because they hurt their friend's feelings, but the greater concern was safety.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the author's action was to prevent a potential tragedy. While the method might be questioned, the intent was good. Therefore, the author isn't the asshole here.\n"
