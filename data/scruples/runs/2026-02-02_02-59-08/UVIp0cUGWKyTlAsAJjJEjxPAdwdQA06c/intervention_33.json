The party started first as a small gathering of friends drinking beer, eating pizza, watching movies. Someone posted on our grad Facebook page about this gathering and before I knew it there were like 50-60 people over smoking weed, drinking vodka and a bunch of other shit. I\u2019m not a smoker or drinker, so I left pretty quickly. My friend, who\u2019s also a grade 12 but was 16 at the time of this event, stayed. \n\nNow I\u2019m back home, reading, watching TV whatever. I\u2019m been on my phone, watching people Snapchat and Instagram\u2019s stories. In one, my friend is the focus where she\u2019s chugging a bottle of vodka, in another she\u2019s smoking a joint and in a third, she\u2019s doing shots with a guy. I know that she drove to the party so I text her to call an Uber. When she doesn\u2019t reply, I call her. She picks up and complains that Uber\u2019s too expensive so I offer to call one for her. She hangs up after saying she\u2019s fine to drive. \n\nMaybe 30 minutes later, I see on one of her friend\u2019s Snapchat story, like 5 different videos of her in the car, driving while smoking and drinking and texting on her phone and one video of them in a Macdonald\u2019s that was posted like 2 mins ago. \n\nI call my friend\u2019s mom and tell her what\u2019s happening. She says thanks and hangs up. I don\u2019t hear from her or her daughter for the rest of the night. \n\nShe\u2019s not at school the next day but I hear from from my friends and classmates that her mom and dad grounded her, taking away her phone for like 6 months and selling her car. All day, I had people, mostly her friends and other classmates who\u2019ve posted videos of themselves drinking and doing drugs, (hell one of the girls was a 16 who has a tinder account and who keeps a bottle of vodka in her locker) coming up to me and calling me a dick and an asshole and a bitch for calling her mom on her when she was just having some harmless fun. \n\nNow this was literally the same day when we had a MADD presentation at school. \n\nThe following day, she\u2019s back at school and the first thing she does when she sees me is punch me and call me a \u201cfucking life ruining asshole\u201d because on top of no phone and goodbye car, her parents aren\u2019t letting her attend any house parties and are considering not letting her go to after-prom. \n\nWas I the asshole for doing this? Because honestly, I kinda feel I am. I mean if something had happened and her car crashed and they died and I hadn\u2019t done anything, I\u2019d feel guilty for not doing anything. But now I feel guilty because I got her in trouble with her parents. And we used to be really good friends but in the last month, since she punched me, we haven\u2019t talked at all which kinda hurts. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for calling someone's mom when they were driving under the influence. The situation involves a 17-year-old at a party where their friend was drinking and driving. The author saw the friend on social media doing risky things, tried to help by suggesting Uber, but she refused. Then the author called the mom, leading to the friend being grounded and a physical altercation.\n\nFirst, the legal aspect: In many places, even if you're a minor, if you see someone underage drinking and driving, you might have a legal duty to report it, especially since it's a public safety issue. The author was trying to prevent a potential accident, which is a valid concern. The friend was driving under the influence, which is illegal and dangerous.\n\nMoral perspective: The author's intent was to protect their friend and others. Even though it led to conflict, the intention was to prevent harm. However, the method\u2014calling the mom without the friend's consent\u2014could be seen as overstepping. But considering the severity of DUI, it's a tough call. The friend had a choice to ignore the help, and the author acted out of concern.\n\nSocial consequences: The author faced backlash from peers, and the friendship was ruined. The friend's parents did take action, so the author's action had a positive outcome in terms of accountability. However, the personal cost to the author is significant.\n\nMADD presentation context is important. It shows the school was addressing DUI, so the author's action aligns with that message. The friend's reaction was violent, which might show that the author's action was necessary.\n\nOverall, while the author's method might have been harsh, the underlying intent was to prevent a dangerous situation. They might not be in the wrong. The friend's actions were illegal, and the author took responsibility for possible guilt if an accident had occurred. The consequences for the friend were a result of her own choices. So, the answer is B.\n"
