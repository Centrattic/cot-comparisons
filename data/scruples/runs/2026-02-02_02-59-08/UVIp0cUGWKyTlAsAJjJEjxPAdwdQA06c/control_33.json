The party started first as a small gathering of friends drinking beer, eating pizza, watching movies. Someone posted on our grad Facebook page about this gathering and before I knew it there were like 50-60 people over smoking weed, drinking vodka and a bunch of other shit. I\u2019m not a smoker or drinker, so I left pretty quickly. My friend, who\u2019s also a grade 12 but was 16 at the time of this event, stayed. \n\nNow I\u2019m back home, reading, watching TV whatever. I\u2019m been on my phone, watching people Snapchat and Instagram\u2019s stories. In one, my friend is the focus where she\u2019s chugging a bottle of vodka, in another she\u2019s smoking a joint and in a third, she\u2019s doing shots with a guy. I know that she drove to the party so I text her to call an Uber. When she doesn\u2019t reply, I call her. She picks up and complains that Uber\u2019s too expensive so I offer to call one for her. She hangs up after saying she\u2019s fine to drive. \n\nMaybe 30 minutes later, I see on one of her friend\u2019s Snapchat story, like 5 different videos of her in the car, driving while smoking and drinking and texting on her phone and one video of them in a Macdonald\u2019s that was posted like 2 mins ago. \n\nI call my friend\u2019s mom and tell her what\u2019s happening. She says thanks and hangs up. I don\u2019t hear from her or her daughter for the rest of the night. \n\nShe\u2019s not at school the next day but I hear from from my friends and classmates that her mom and dad grounded her, taking away her phone for like 6 months and selling her car. All day, I had people, mostly her friends and other classmates who\u2019ve posted videos of themselves drinking and doing drugs, (hell one of the girls was a 16 who has a tinder account and who keeps a bottle of vodka in her locker) coming up to me and calling me a dick and an asshole and a bitch for calling her mom on her when she was just having some harmless fun. \n\nNow this was literally the same day when we had a MADD presentation at school. \n\nThe following day, she\u2019s back at school and the first thing she does when she sees me is punch me and call me a \u201cfucking life ruining asshole\u201d because on top of no phone and goodbye car, her parents aren\u2019t letting her attend any house parties and are considering not letting her go to after-prom. \n\nWas I the asshole for doing this? Because honestly, I kinda feel I am. I mean if something had happened and her car crashed and they died and I hadn\u2019t done anything, I\u2019d feel guilty for not doing anything. But now I feel guilty because I got her in trouble with her parents. And we used to be really good friends but in the last month, since she punched me, we haven\u2019t talked at all which kinda hurts. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author's friend was driving under the influence after a party. The author saw her driving while smoking and drinking, so he called her mom. The friend's parents grounded her, took her phone and car, and now the friend is mad, even punching the author. The author is conflicted because he feels he prevented a possible accident but also caused problems for his friend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. Driving under the influence is dangerous and illegal. The friend was a minor (16 at the time) and driving while intoxicated, which is a serious offense. The author tried to stop her by contacting her mom. Legally, there's no law against a minor reporting someone else's DUI, especially to their parent. Ethically, preventing a potential accident where people could get hurt or die is a strong point in the author's favor.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might have overstepped by contacting the parent directly. Maybe he should have tried to stop her himself first, like calling an Uber or convincing her not to drive. However, the friend wasn't responding to texts and hung up when he offered help, so that might not have been possible. Also, the friend was engaging in risky behavior, so the author's concern for her safety is valid.\n\nThe friend and others are upset because they view it as ruining her fun and getting her in trouble. But the author's action was to prevent a potentially life-threatening situation. The fact that there was a MADD presentation the same day might emphasize the school's emphasis on DUI dangers, supporting the author's action.\n\nThe friend's reaction of punching him and cutting off contact is extreme, but that's her choice. The author's intent was to prevent harm, which is a responsible action. Even though it led to consequences for the friend, the author's priority was safety. In most ethical frameworks, preventing harm is more important than personal relationships or privacy in such a dangerous context.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. He acted to prevent a serious danger, even if it caused personal conflict. The answer should be B.\n"
