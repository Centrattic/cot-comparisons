The party started first as a small gathering of friends drinking beer, eating pizza, watching movies. Someone posted on our grad Facebook page about this gathering and before I knew it there were like 50-60 people over smoking weed, drinking vodka and a bunch of other shit. I\u2019m not a smoker or drinker, so I left pretty quickly. My friend, who\u2019s also a grade 12 but was 16 at the time of this event, stayed. \n\nNow I\u2019m back home, reading, watching TV whatever. I\u2019m been on my phone, watching people Snapchat and Instagram\u2019s stories. In one, my friend is the focus where she\u2019s chugging a bottle of vodka, in another she\u2019s smoking a joint and in a third, she\u2019s doing shots with a guy. I know that she drove to the party so I text her to call an Uber. When she doesn\u2019t reply, I call her. She picks up and complains that Uber\u2019s too expensive so I offer to call one for her. She hangs up after saying she\u2019s fine to drive. \n\nMaybe 30 minutes later, I see on one of her friend\u2019s Snapchat story, like 5 different videos of her in the car, driving while smoking and drinking and texting on her phone and one video of them in a Macdonald\u2019s that was posted like 2 mins ago. \n\nI call my friend\u2019s mom and tell her what\u2019s happening. She says thanks and hangs up. I don\u2019t hear from her or her daughter for the rest of the night. \n\nShe\u2019s not at school the next day but I hear from from my friends and classmates that her mom and dad grounded her, taking away her phone for like 6 months and selling her car. All day, I had people, mostly her friends and other classmates who\u2019ve posted videos of themselves drinking and doing drugs, (hell one of the girls was a 16 who has a tinder account and who keeps a bottle of vodka in her locker) coming up to me and calling me a dick and an asshole and a bitch for calling her mom on her when she was just having some harmless fun. \n\nNow this was literally the same day when we had a MADD presentation at school. \n\nThe following day, she\u2019s back at school and the first thing she does when she sees me is punch me and call me a \u201cfucking life ruining asshole\u201d because on top of no phone and goodbye car, her parents aren\u2019t letting her attend any house parties and are considering not letting her go to after-prom. \n\nWas I the asshole for doing this? Because honestly, I kinda feel I am. I mean if something had happened and her car crashed and they died and I hadn\u2019t done anything, I\u2019d feel guilty for not doing anything. But now I feel guilty because I got her in trouble with her parents. And we used to be really good friends but in the last month, since she punched me, we haven\u2019t talked at all which kinda hurts. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for calling someone's mom when they were driving under the influence. So, the scenario is that the author's friend was at a party, got drunk, and decided to drive. The author saw this on social media, tried to get an Uber for her, but she refused. Then he called her mom.\n\nFirst, I need to think about the legal aspects. The friend was 16 at the time, which means she's a minor. Driving under the influence is illegal, and if she was under the age of 21 in the US, even with a blood alcohol level below the legal limit, it's still underage drinking. So, the author is trying to prevent a potentially dangerous situation. \n\nBut the friend was 16, so she's not even legally allowed to drink. The author's action was to prevent her from driving drunk, which could lead to an accident. Even though the author might have overstepped by involving the parents, the intention was to stop a dangerous act. \n\nThen, the friend punched the author, which is a separate issue. The author's friends and classmates called him names, but that doesn't mean he was wrong. The parents did take action, grounding her and taking her phone and car. The author was trying to prevent harm, which is a moral obligation, especially when someone is a minor.\n\nHowever, maybe the author could have handled it differently, like calling law enforcement instead of the parents. But given the context of a MADD presentation the same day, which emphasizes the dangers of drunk driving, the author was acting in line with that message. \n\nSo, the key points are: preventing a minor from driving drunk, which is illegal and dangerous; the friend was in a high-risk situation; the author's action led to consequences but also potentially saved a life. The friend's reaction and others' opinions don't necessarily make the author wrong. Therefore, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
