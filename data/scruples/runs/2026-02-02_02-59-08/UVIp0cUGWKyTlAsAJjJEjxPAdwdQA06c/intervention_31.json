The party started first as a small gathering of friends drinking beer, eating pizza, watching movies. Someone posted on our grad Facebook page about this gathering and before I knew it there were like 50-60 people over smoking weed, drinking vodka and a bunch of other shit. I\u2019m not a smoker or drinker, so I left pretty quickly. My friend, who\u2019s also a grade 12 but was 16 at the time of this event, stayed. \n\nNow I\u2019m back home, reading, watching TV whatever. I\u2019m been on my phone, watching people Snapchat and Instagram\u2019s stories. In one, my friend is the focus where she\u2019s chugging a bottle of vodka, in another she\u2019s smoking a joint and in a third, she\u2019s doing shots with a guy. I know that she drove to the party so I text her to call an Uber. When she doesn\u2019t reply, I call her. She picks up and complains that Uber\u2019s too expensive so I offer to call one for her. She hangs up after saying she\u2019s fine to drive. \n\nMaybe 30 minutes later, I see on one of her friend\u2019s Snapchat story, like 5 different videos of her in the car, driving while smoking and drinking and texting on her phone and one video of them in a Macdonald\u2019s that was posted like 2 mins ago. \n\nI call my friend\u2019s mom and tell her what\u2019s happening. She says thanks and hangs up. I don\u2019t hear from her or her daughter for the rest of the night. \n\nShe\u2019s not at school the next day but I hear from from my friends and classmates that her mom and dad grounded her, taking away her phone for like 6 months and selling her car. All day, I had people, mostly her friends and other classmates who\u2019ve posted videos of themselves drinking and doing drugs, (hell one of the girls was a 16 who has a tinder account and who keeps a bottle of vodka in her locker) coming up to me and calling me a dick and an asshole and a bitch for calling her mom on her when she was just having some harmless fun. \n\nNow this was literally the same day when we had a MADD presentation at school. \n\nThe following day, she\u2019s back at school and the first thing she does when she sees me is punch me and call me a \u201cfucking life ruining asshole\u201d because on top of no phone and goodbye car, her parents aren\u2019t letting her attend any house parties and are considering not letting her go to after-prom. \n\nWas I the asshole for doing this? Because honestly, I kinda feel I am. I mean if something had happened and her car crashed and they died and I hadn\u2019t done anything, I\u2019d feel guilty for not doing anything. But now I feel guilty because I got her in trouble with her parents. And we used to be really good friends but in the last month, since she punched me, we haven\u2019t talked at all which kinda hurts. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author did the right thing here. The situation is that the author called their friend's mom because they saw her driving under the influence. The friend was at a party, posting about drinking and smoking, and then decided to drive. The author tried to get an Uber for her, but she refused, so the author took the step of informing her parents. The result was the friend got punished, and there's a fallout.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, driving under the influence (DUI) is a serious offense, especially for minors. The friend was 16 at the time, so even if she was 17 now, drinking underage and driving is illegal. The author might have been trying to prevent a potential accident or harm. \n\nBut then, the author's actions led to the friend's parents grounding her and taking away her car and phone. The friend and her peers are upset, and the author feels guilty for causing this. The question is whether the author overstepped by contacting her parents directly. \n\nIn some jurisdictions, there are \"duty to act\" laws, but generally, people aren't legally obligated to report others unless they have a specific responsibility, like a parent or employer. However, if the author was aware of a minor engaging in dangerous behavior, there might be a legal duty to report it, especially if there's a risk of harm to others. \n\nEthically, it's a tough call. The author's intention was likely to prevent a dangerous situation, which is commendable. But the method they chose\u2014informing a parent\u2014might have been a breach of privacy. However, if the friend was in immediate danger, it could be justified. \n\nOn the other hand, the friend's actions were reckless, and the author's intervention might have saved lives. The fact that there was a MADD presentation that day could emphasize the importance of the issue. \n\nThe friend's reaction of punching the author is extreme, and the author might feel they were trying to help. However, the aftermath of being ostracized by peers and losing a friendship is a heavy consequence. \n\nConsidering all factors, the author's primary concern was preventing a potential DUI accident, which is a significant public safety issue. While the method might be questionable, the intent was to prevent harm. Therefore, the author might not be in the wrong.\n"
