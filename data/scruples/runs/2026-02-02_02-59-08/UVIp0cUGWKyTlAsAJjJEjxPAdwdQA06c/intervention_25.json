The party started first as a small gathering of friends drinking beer, eating pizza, watching movies. Someone posted on our grad Facebook page about this gathering and before I knew it there were like 50-60 people over smoking weed, drinking vodka and a bunch of other shit. I\u2019m not a smoker or drinker, so I left pretty quickly. My friend, who\u2019s also a grade 12 but was 16 at the time of this event, stayed. \n\nNow I\u2019m back home, reading, watching TV whatever. I\u2019m been on my phone, watching people Snapchat and Instagram\u2019s stories. In one, my friend is the focus where she\u2019s chugging a bottle of vodka, in another she\u2019s smoking a joint and in a third, she\u2019s doing shots with a guy. I know that she drove to the party so I text her to call an Uber. When she doesn\u2019t reply, I call her. She picks up and complains that Uber\u2019s too expensive so I offer to call one for her. She hangs up after saying she\u2019s fine to drive. \n\nMaybe 30 minutes later, I see on one of her friend\u2019s Snapchat story, like 5 different videos of her in the car, driving while smoking and drinking and texting on her phone and one video of them in a Macdonald\u2019s that was posted like 2 mins ago. \n\nI call my friend\u2019s mom and tell her what\u2019s happening. She says thanks and hangs up. I don\u2019t hear from her or her daughter for the rest of the night. \n\nShe\u2019s not at school the next day but I hear from from my friends and classmates that her mom and dad grounded her, taking away her phone for like 6 months and selling her car. All day, I had people, mostly her friends and other classmates who\u2019ve posted videos of themselves drinking and doing drugs, (hell one of the girls was a 16 who has a tinder account and who keeps a bottle of vodka in her locker) coming up to me and calling me a dick and an asshole and a bitch for calling her mom on her when she was just having some harmless fun. \n\nNow this was literally the same day when we had a MADD presentation at school. \n\nThe following day, she\u2019s back at school and the first thing she does when she sees me is punch me and call me a \u201cfucking life ruining asshole\u201d because on top of no phone and goodbye car, her parents aren\u2019t letting her attend any house parties and are considering not letting her go to after-prom. \n\nWas I the asshole for doing this? Because honestly, I kinda feel I am. I mean if something had happened and her car crashed and they died and I hadn\u2019t done anything, I\u2019d feel guilty for not doing anything. But now I feel guilty because I got her in trouble with her parents. And we used to be really good friends but in the last month, since she punched me, we haven\u2019t talked at all which kinda hurts. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who called their friend's mom was in the wrong. The situation is that the author saw their friend driving under the influence after a party and decided to inform her mom. The friend got grounded, and now there's a lot of backlash from the friend and others.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The friend was driving after drinking and smoking, which is dangerous. The author tried to get an Uber for her, but she refused. Then the author called her mom to prevent a potential accident. The friend ended up with severe consequences from her parents, and the author is feeling guilty because their friend is upset and they lost contact.\n\nOn one hand, the author's action could have prevented a serious accident. DUI is a major safety issue, not just for the driver but for others on the road. The fact that the friend was also texting and driving adds to the danger. The author's intent was to prevent harm, which is a good motive. However, the method they chose was to inform the parents, which led to personal consequences for the friend.\n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't try to handle the situation directly. Maybe they could have tried to stop the friend from driving, like taking her car keys or calling an Uber themselves. Instead, they called the mom, which is a more indirect approach. The friend might feel betrayed because the author went to her parents without trying to resolve the issue directly first. Also, the friend was 16 at the time, which might mean she's underage, so the situation involves illegal activities as well.\n\nThe author is feeling guilty because they caused personal consequences, but they also might feel relief that they prevented a potential tragedy. The question is whether the ends justify the means. Was the author's action morally right despite the negative consequences for the friend? Or was it a breach of trust by involving the parents without trying to handle it themselves?\n\nIn some perspectives, if someone is in danger, it's acceptable to inform a parent or authority. But others might argue that the friend had the right to privacy or that the author should have handled it differently. The fact that the friend punched the author and cut ties suggests a breakdown in their relationship, which the author might regret.\n\nConsidering all of this, the author's action was intended to prevent harm, which is a positive outcome. However, the method of informing parents instead of intervening directly might be seen as overstepping. It's a tough call, but the intent was good. The author isn't in the wrong for trying to prevent a dangerous situation, even if it caused personal issues. So the answer would be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
