The party started first as a small gathering of friends drinking beer, eating pizza, watching movies. Someone posted on our grad Facebook page about this gathering and before I knew it there were like 50-60 people over smoking weed, drinking vodka and a bunch of other shit. I\u2019m not a smoker or drinker, so I left pretty quickly. My friend, who\u2019s also a grade 12 but was 16 at the time of this event, stayed. \n\nNow I\u2019m back home, reading, watching TV whatever. I\u2019m been on my phone, watching people Snapchat and Instagram\u2019s stories. In one, my friend is the focus where she\u2019s chugging a bottle of vodka, in another she\u2019s smoking a joint and in a third, she\u2019s doing shots with a guy. I know that she drove to the party so I text her to call an Uber. When she doesn\u2019t reply, I call her. She picks up and complains that Uber\u2019s too expensive so I offer to call one for her. She hangs up after saying she\u2019s fine to drive. \n\nMaybe 30 minutes later, I see on one of her friend\u2019s Snapchat story, like 5 different videos of her in the car, driving while smoking and drinking and texting on her phone and one video of them in a Macdonald\u2019s that was posted like 2 mins ago. \n\nI call my friend\u2019s mom and tell her what\u2019s happening. She says thanks and hangs up. I don\u2019t hear from her or her daughter for the rest of the night. \n\nShe\u2019s not at school the next day but I hear from from my friends and classmates that her mom and dad grounded her, taking away her phone for like 6 months and selling her car. All day, I had people, mostly her friends and other classmates who\u2019ve posted videos of themselves drinking and doing drugs, (hell one of the girls was a 16 who has a tinder account and who keeps a bottle of vodka in her locker) coming up to me and calling me a dick and an asshole and a bitch for calling her mom on her when she was just having some harmless fun. \n\nNow this was literally the same day when we had a MADD presentation at school. \n\nThe following day, she\u2019s back at school and the first thing she does when she sees me is punch me and call me a \u201cfucking life ruining asshole\u201d because on top of no phone and goodbye car, her parents aren\u2019t letting her attend any house parties and are considering not letting her go to after-prom. \n\nWas I the asshole for doing this? Because honestly, I kinda feel I am. I mean if something had happened and her car crashed and they died and I hadn\u2019t done anything, I\u2019d feel guilty for not doing anything. But now I feel guilty because I got her in trouble with her parents. And we used to be really good friends but in the last month, since she punched me, we haven\u2019t talked at all which kinda hurts. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants to know if the person who called their friend's mom is in the wrong. So, the situation is a party where underage drinking and driving were happening. The author is 17, saw their friend was driving under the influence, tried to get an Uber, but the friend refused. Then the author called the mom, leading to the friend getting grounded and losing her car. Now, the friend is upset and even punched the author.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The main issue here is whether the author acted wrongly by reporting the DUI. The friend was driving while intoxicated, which is dangerous. The author tried to intervene by offering an Uber but was ignored. Then, seeing evidence of the friend driving under the influence, they contacted the mom. \n\nOn one hand, the author is trying to prevent a potential accident, which is a life-threatening situation. The MADD presentation at school the same day emphasizes the dangers of DUI, so the author might have felt a duty to act. The friend's actions could have led to serious consequences, so reporting it could be seen as a responsible decision.\n\nOn the other hand, the friend might feel betrayed. The author didn't go through her directly but informed her parents, which could be seen as a breach of trust. The friend's friends are also upset, calling the author an asshole, which suggests social backlash. The author's guilt stems from both the friend's punishment and the loss of the friendship.\n\nLegally, in many places, it's a good samaritan law that you can report someone for DUI without liability. Ethically, it's about preventing harm. However, the method of reporting might affect the perception. Did the author have a responsibility to try to talk to the friend first? They did try to get an Uber, but when that failed, contacting a parent could be a next step.\n\nThe friend's actions were reckless, and the author's intervention prevented a possible accident. The resulting punishment from the parents is a consequence of the friend's actions, not the author's. The author isn't responsible for the parents' disciplinary actions, just for reporting the truth. So, while the author might feel guilty, they aren't in the wrong for trying to prevent a dangerous situation. The friend's reaction and the social backlash might be more about the consequences of her own actions rather than the author's intent to help.\n"
