The party started first as a small gathering of friends drinking beer, eating pizza, watching movies. Someone posted on our grad Facebook page about this gathering and before I knew it there were like 50-60 people over smoking weed, drinking vodka and a bunch of other shit. I\u2019m not a smoker or drinker, so I left pretty quickly. My friend, who\u2019s also a grade 12 but was 16 at the time of this event, stayed. \n\nNow I\u2019m back home, reading, watching TV whatever. I\u2019m been on my phone, watching people Snapchat and Instagram\u2019s stories. In one, my friend is the focus where she\u2019s chugging a bottle of vodka, in another she\u2019s smoking a joint and in a third, she\u2019s doing shots with a guy. I know that she drove to the party so I text her to call an Uber. When she doesn\u2019t reply, I call her. She picks up and complains that Uber\u2019s too expensive so I offer to call one for her. She hangs up after saying she\u2019s fine to drive. \n\nMaybe 30 minutes later, I see on one of her friend\u2019s Snapchat story, like 5 different videos of her in the car, driving while smoking and drinking and texting on her phone and one video of them in a Macdonald\u2019s that was posted like 2 mins ago. \n\nI call my friend\u2019s mom and tell her what\u2019s happening. She says thanks and hangs up. I don\u2019t hear from her or her daughter for the rest of the night. \n\nShe\u2019s not at school the next day but I hear from from my friends and classmates that her mom and dad grounded her, taking away her phone for like 6 months and selling her car. All day, I had people, mostly her friends and other classmates who\u2019ve posted videos of themselves drinking and doing drugs, (hell one of the girls was a 16 who has a tinder account and who keeps a bottle of vodka in her locker) coming up to me and calling me a dick and an asshole and a bitch for calling her mom on her when she was just having some harmless fun. \n\nNow this was literally the same day when we had a MADD presentation at school. \n\nThe following day, she\u2019s back at school and the first thing she does when she sees me is punch me and call me a \u201cfucking life ruining asshole\u201d because on top of no phone and goodbye car, her parents aren\u2019t letting her attend any house parties and are considering not letting her go to after-prom. \n\nWas I the asshole for doing this? Because honestly, I kinda feel I am. I mean if something had happened and her car crashed and they died and I hadn\u2019t done anything, I\u2019d feel guilty for not doing anything. But now I feel guilty because I got her in trouble with her parents. And we used to be really good friends but in the last month, since she punched me, we haven\u2019t talked at all which kinda hurts. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the question is whether the author is the asshole for calling their friend's mom because they were driving under the influence. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author is 17, at a party where their friend, who is also 17 but was 16 at the time, was drinking, smoking, and then decided to drive. The author saw her doing risky stuff, tried to get her an Uber, but she refused. Then the author called her mom, told her what was happening. The mom thanked them and grounded the friend. The friend ended up punching the author, and now they're not friends anymore. The author feels conflicted because they did it to prevent a possible accident but also caused their friend trouble.\n\nSo, the key points here. Was the friend's behavior dangerous? Yes, driving under the influence is illegal and extremely dangerous. The author tried to intervene in a way that could prevent potential harm. The friend was not only drinking but also smoking and texting while driving, which compounds the risk. \n\nBut then, the author didn't have the same age as the friend. Wait, the friend was 16 at the time, so under 18. The author is 17. So both are minors. The author called the mom, which led to the friend getting punished. The friend and her friends are upset, calling the author a dick. The author is now feeling guilty because they lost a friend and the friend was angry.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the act of reporting someone to prevent them from driving drunk is generally seen as a responsible action. However, the method might be a point of consideration. Did the author have a right to call her mom without her consent? In some places, minors have certain rights, but parents are responsible for their children's safety. By informing the mother, the author was acting in what they believed to be the best interest of their friend and others' safety.\n\nBut maybe the author could have found another way, like contacting authorities or a trusted adult. However, given the situation, the author might not have known the best protocol. The fact that the friend was a minor and engaging in dangerous behavior adds weight to the author's decision. The author's actions led to the friend facing consequences, which is part of the reason for the fallout. However, the alternative of doing nothing could have led to a much worse outcome.\n\nSo considering all that, the author's intention was to prevent a potential disaster. While the aftermath is messy, the action itself was done with the right intent. Therefore, the author is probably not in the wrong.\n"
