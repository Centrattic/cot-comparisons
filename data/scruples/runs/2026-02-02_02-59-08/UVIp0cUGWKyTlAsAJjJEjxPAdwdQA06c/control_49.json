The party started first as a small gathering of friends drinking beer, eating pizza, watching movies. Someone posted on our grad Facebook page about this gathering and before I knew it there were like 50-60 people over smoking weed, drinking vodka and a bunch of other shit. I\u2019m not a smoker or drinker, so I left pretty quickly. My friend, who\u2019s also a grade 12 but was 16 at the time of this event, stayed. \n\nNow I\u2019m back home, reading, watching TV whatever. I\u2019m been on my phone, watching people Snapchat and Instagram\u2019s stories. In one, my friend is the focus where she\u2019s chugging a bottle of vodka, in another she\u2019s smoking a joint and in a third, she\u2019s doing shots with a guy. I know that she drove to the party so I text her to call an Uber. When she doesn\u2019t reply, I call her. She picks up and complains that Uber\u2019s too expensive so I offer to call one for her. She hangs up after saying she\u2019s fine to drive. \n\nMaybe 30 minutes later, I see on one of her friend\u2019s Snapchat story, like 5 different videos of her in the car, driving while smoking and drinking and texting on her phone and one video of them in a Macdonald\u2019s that was posted like 2 mins ago. \n\nI call my friend\u2019s mom and tell her what\u2019s happening. She says thanks and hangs up. I don\u2019t hear from her or her daughter for the rest of the night. \n\nShe\u2019s not at school the next day but I hear from from my friends and classmates that her mom and dad grounded her, taking away her phone for like 6 months and selling her car. All day, I had people, mostly her friends and other classmates who\u2019ve posted videos of themselves drinking and doing drugs, (hell one of the girls was a 16 who has a tinder account and who keeps a bottle of vodka in her locker) coming up to me and calling me a dick and an asshole and a bitch for calling her mom on her when she was just having some harmless fun. \n\nNow this was literally the same day when we had a MADD presentation at school. \n\nThe following day, she\u2019s back at school and the first thing she does when she sees me is punch me and call me a \u201cfucking life ruining asshole\u201d because on top of no phone and goodbye car, her parents aren\u2019t letting her attend any house parties and are considering not letting her go to after-prom. \n\nWas I the asshole for doing this? Because honestly, I kinda feel I am. I mean if something had happened and her car crashed and they died and I hadn\u2019t done anything, I\u2019d feel guilty for not doing anything. But now I feel guilty because I got her in trouble with her parents. And we used to be really good friends but in the last month, since she punched me, we haven\u2019t talked at all which kinda hurts. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is at fault for calling someone's mom because that person was driving while under the influence. The situation involves a 17-year-old at a party where their friend was drinking and smoking, then decided to drive. The author tried to get an Uber for her, but she refused. Then, after seeing Snapchat videos showing her driving dangerously, the author contacted her mom. The friend ended up getting grounded and had her car sold. Now, the friend is upset, and others are calling the author an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, it's illegal for minors to drink and drive. If someone is underage and driving under the influence, it's a serious offense. The author's action could prevent a potential accident or save lives. However, the method they used\u2014calling the mom without the friend's consent\u2014might be seen as invasive.\n\nBut the key points here are safety vs. privacy. The author's intention was to prevent harm, which is a noble cause. However, the friend was making her own choices, even if they were risky. The question is whether the author overstepped by involving her parents without a more direct intervention first, like calling the police. \n\nAlso, the age of the friends is important. At 16 and 17, they're minors, so parents do have a role in monitoring their behavior. The author's action led to consequences from the parents, which the friend is upset about. The friend's friends are upset because they see it as ruining the fun, but the author's action was based on safety concerns.\n\nAnother angle is the aftermath. The friend punched the author, which is a physical response, but does that justify the earlier action? Probably not. The real issue is whether the author had the right to call her mom. In some cases, people might argue that it's better to involve parents when a minor is in danger, especially if they're making risky decisions. But others might say the author should have tried to stop her themselves or called authorities instead of involving family, which could lead to personal conflict.\n\nConsidering all that, the author's primary intention was to prevent a dangerous situation, which is a valid concern. However, the method might be debatable. But in terms of being the \"asshole,\" the author was trying to prevent a potential disaster, which is more about safety than meddling. The friend's reaction is extreme, and the author isn't in the wrong for acting to prevent harm.\n"
