The party started first as a small gathering of friends drinking beer, eating pizza, watching movies. Someone posted on our grad Facebook page about this gathering and before I knew it there were like 50-60 people over smoking weed, drinking vodka and a bunch of other shit. I\u2019m not a smoker or drinker, so I left pretty quickly. My friend, who\u2019s also a grade 12 but was 16 at the time of this event, stayed. \n\nNow I\u2019m back home, reading, watching TV whatever. I\u2019m been on my phone, watching people Snapchat and Instagram\u2019s stories. In one, my friend is the focus where she\u2019s chugging a bottle of vodka, in another she\u2019s smoking a joint and in a third, she\u2019s doing shots with a guy. I know that she drove to the party so I text her to call an Uber. When she doesn\u2019t reply, I call her. She picks up and complains that Uber\u2019s too expensive so I offer to call one for her. She hangs up after saying she\u2019s fine to drive. \n\nMaybe 30 minutes later, I see on one of her friend\u2019s Snapchat story, like 5 different videos of her in the car, driving while smoking and drinking and texting on her phone and one video of them in a Macdonald\u2019s that was posted like 2 mins ago. \n\nI call my friend\u2019s mom and tell her what\u2019s happening. She says thanks and hangs up. I don\u2019t hear from her or her daughter for the rest of the night. \n\nShe\u2019s not at school the next day but I hear from from my friends and classmates that her mom and dad grounded her, taking away her phone for like 6 months and selling her car. All day, I had people, mostly her friends and other classmates who\u2019ve posted videos of themselves drinking and doing drugs, (hell one of the girls was a 16 who has a tinder account and who keeps a bottle of vodka in her locker) coming up to me and calling me a dick and an asshole and a bitch for calling her mom on her when she was just having some harmless fun. \n\nNow this was literally the same day when we had a MADD presentation at school. \n\nThe following day, she\u2019s back at school and the first thing she does when she sees me is punch me and call me a \u201cfucking life ruining asshole\u201d because on top of no phone and goodbye car, her parents aren\u2019t letting her attend any house parties and are considering not letting her go to after-prom. \n\nWas I the asshole for doing this? Because honestly, I kinda feel I am. I mean if something had happened and her car crashed and they died and I hadn\u2019t done anything, I\u2019d feel guilty for not doing anything. But now I feel guilty because I got her in trouble with her parents. And we used to be really good friends but in the last month, since she punched me, we haven\u2019t talked at all which kinda hurts. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about a 17-year-old who called their friend's mom because the friend was driving under the influence. The friend was at a party, posted videos of herself drinking and driving, and the author tried to warn her, but when she refused, called her mom. The friend got grounded and angry, and now the author feels guilty but also conflicted about whether they did the right thing.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the key points. The friend was underage (16) and driving while drinking and using her phone. The author tried to help by offering an Uber, but the friend refused. Then, the author called the mom to prevent a potential accident. The mom appreciated it and the parents took action. However, the friend and her friends are upset, and there's a fallout.\n\nThe main question is whether the author was wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). The user wants a straightforward answer based on the scenario.\n\nLooking at the facts: The author acted to prevent a dangerous situation. DUI is a serious offense, especially for minors. The friend was engaging in risky behavior, and the author tried to intervene. The author didn't physically harm anyone, just informed the parents. The friend's reaction was violent, which complicates things, but the author's intention was to prevent harm. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author overstepped by contacting the parents without the friend's consent. However, given the potential consequences of DUI\u2014like a car accident\u2014the author's action can be seen as a responsible choice to prevent harm. The friend's friends and others are upset, but their judgment is clouded by their own involvement in the risky behavior.\n\nThe MADD presentation at school that same day adds context about the dangers of drunk driving, which the author might have been influenced by. The author's actions align with the safety message of the presentation. The friend's punishment, while harsh, was a result of her own actions and her parents' response. The author didn't cause the punishment directly; they just informed the parents.\n\nThe emotional fallout, like the punch and lost friendship, is unfortunate, but the author's primary intent was to prevent a potential tragedy. In most ethical frameworks, preventing harm (like a car accident) is justified even if it causes immediate conflict. The author isn't at fault for trying to stop someone from endangering themselves and others. Therefore, the answer should be B\u2014author is not in the wrong.\n"
