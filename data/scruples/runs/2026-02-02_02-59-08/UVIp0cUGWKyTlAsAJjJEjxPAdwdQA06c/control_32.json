The party started first as a small gathering of friends drinking beer, eating pizza, watching movies. Someone posted on our grad Facebook page about this gathering and before I knew it there were like 50-60 people over smoking weed, drinking vodka and a bunch of other shit. I\u2019m not a smoker or drinker, so I left pretty quickly. My friend, who\u2019s also a grade 12 but was 16 at the time of this event, stayed. \n\nNow I\u2019m back home, reading, watching TV whatever. I\u2019m been on my phone, watching people Snapchat and Instagram\u2019s stories. In one, my friend is the focus where she\u2019s chugging a bottle of vodka, in another she\u2019s smoking a joint and in a third, she\u2019s doing shots with a guy. I know that she drove to the party so I text her to call an Uber. When she doesn\u2019t reply, I call her. She picks up and complains that Uber\u2019s too expensive so I offer to call one for her. She hangs up after saying she\u2019s fine to drive. \n\nMaybe 30 minutes later, I see on one of her friend\u2019s Snapchat story, like 5 different videos of her in the car, driving while smoking and drinking and texting on her phone and one video of them in a Macdonald\u2019s that was posted like 2 mins ago. \n\nI call my friend\u2019s mom and tell her what\u2019s happening. She says thanks and hangs up. I don\u2019t hear from her or her daughter for the rest of the night. \n\nShe\u2019s not at school the next day but I hear from from my friends and classmates that her mom and dad grounded her, taking away her phone for like 6 months and selling her car. All day, I had people, mostly her friends and other classmates who\u2019ve posted videos of themselves drinking and doing drugs, (hell one of the girls was a 16 who has a tinder account and who keeps a bottle of vodka in her locker) coming up to me and calling me a dick and an asshole and a bitch for calling her mom on her when she was just having some harmless fun. \n\nNow this was literally the same day when we had a MADD presentation at school. \n\nThe following day, she\u2019s back at school and the first thing she does when she sees me is punch me and call me a \u201cfucking life ruining asshole\u201d because on top of no phone and goodbye car, her parents aren\u2019t letting her attend any house parties and are considering not letting her go to after-prom. \n\nWas I the asshole for doing this? Because honestly, I kinda feel I am. I mean if something had happened and her car crashed and they died and I hadn\u2019t done anything, I\u2019d feel guilty for not doing anything. But now I feel guilty because I got her in trouble with her parents. And we used to be really good friends but in the last month, since she punched me, we haven\u2019t talked at all which kinda hurts. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author did the wrong thing by calling their friend's mom to report her for driving under the influence. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author is 17, at a party where things got out of hand. They left early because they don't drink or smoke. Their friend, who was 16 at the time, stayed and started posting intoxicated behavior. The author tried to get her Uber but she refused, then later saw her driving while impaired. So they called her mom, which led to the friend getting grounded and her parents taking away her car and phone.\n\nNow, the key points here. The friend was underage (16) and driving under the influence, which is illegal. The author tried to intervene in a situation where someone's behavior could lead to serious consequences. By reporting it, the author prevented a potential accident or injury. \n\nBut the friend and others are upset because they see it as ruining their fun. The author's actions led to consequences from the parents. The question is whether the author was wrong.\n\nLegally, underage drinking and DUI are issues. The author's intent was to prevent harm. Even if the friend was upset, the author acted to stop a dangerous situation. However, there's a moral aspect to consider: did the author overstep by involving the parents? \n\nBut given that the friend's actions were illegal and could lead to a crash, the author's action might be justified. The friends who are upset are perhaps prioritizing their own freedom over safety. \n\nThe author also mentions feeling guilty for getting her in trouble, but if it prevented a disaster, maybe that's the right choice. The fact that the friend physically attacked the author adds to the emotional impact.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, minors can't legally drink, and driving under the influence is a major offense. The author's action aligns with preventing harm, even if it caused personal conflict. So, the answer is likely B (author not in the wrong).\n"
