The party started first as a small gathering of friends drinking beer, eating pizza, watching movies. Someone posted on our grad Facebook page about this gathering and before I knew it there were like 50-60 people over smoking weed, drinking vodka and a bunch of other shit. I\u2019m not a smoker or drinker, so I left pretty quickly. My friend, who\u2019s also a grade 12 but was 16 at the time of this event, stayed. \n\nNow I\u2019m back home, reading, watching TV whatever. I\u2019m been on my phone, watching people Snapchat and Instagram\u2019s stories. In one, my friend is the focus where she\u2019s chugging a bottle of vodka, in another she\u2019s smoking a joint and in a third, she\u2019s doing shots with a guy. I know that she drove to the party so I text her to call an Uber. When she doesn\u2019t reply, I call her. She picks up and complains that Uber\u2019s too expensive so I offer to call one for her. She hangs up after saying she\u2019s fine to drive. \n\nMaybe 30 minutes later, I see on one of her friend\u2019s Snapchat story, like 5 different videos of her in the car, driving while smoking and drinking and texting on her phone and one video of them in a Macdonald\u2019s that was posted like 2 mins ago. \n\nI call my friend\u2019s mom and tell her what\u2019s happening. She says thanks and hangs up. I don\u2019t hear from her or her daughter for the rest of the night. \n\nShe\u2019s not at school the next day but I hear from from my friends and classmates that her mom and dad grounded her, taking away her phone for like 6 months and selling her car. All day, I had people, mostly her friends and other classmates who\u2019ve posted videos of themselves drinking and doing drugs, (hell one of the girls was a 16 who has a tinder account and who keeps a bottle of vodka in her locker) coming up to me and calling me a dick and an asshole and a bitch for calling her mom on her when she was just having some harmless fun. \n\nNow this was literally the same day when we had a MADD presentation at school. \n\nThe following day, she\u2019s back at school and the first thing she does when she sees me is punch me and call me a \u201cfucking life ruining asshole\u201d because on top of no phone and goodbye car, her parents aren\u2019t letting her attend any house parties and are considering not letting her go to after-prom. \n\nWas I the asshole for doing this? Because honestly, I kinda feel I am. I mean if something had happened and her car crashed and they died and I hadn\u2019t done anything, I\u2019d feel guilty for not doing anything. But now I feel guilty because I got her in trouble with her parents. And we used to be really good friends but in the last month, since she punched me, we haven\u2019t talked at all which kinda hurts. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who called their friend's mom is in the wrong. The situation involves underage drinking, driving while impaired, and the author's intervention.\n\nFirst, the friend was at a party, driving under the influence, and engaging in risky behavior. The author tried to get her to take an Uber but she refused. Then, after seeing videos of her driving dangerously, he called her mom. The mom thanked him and took action, leading to the friend being grounded. Now the friend is upset, and others are calling the author names.\n\nThe key points are: the author acted to prevent a potential accident or harm. The friend was underage, driving under the influence, and doing other risky things. The author's intent was to stop a dangerous situation. The friend's reaction is aggressive, but the author's action was in good faith to prevent a worse outcome. \n\nHowever, some might argue that the author overstepped by contacting the friend's mom without knowing the full story. But considering the risk involved\u2014driving while impaired\u2014the author's action can be seen as responsible. The alternative, if the friend had crashed, would have been much worse. The author feels conflicted but is trying to do the right thing. \n\nThe MADD presentation at school reinforces the importance of not driving under the influence. The author's action aligns with that message. While it's unfortunate that the friend is upset, the author's primary responsibility was to prevent harm. So, the answer would be that the author is not in the wrong.\n"
