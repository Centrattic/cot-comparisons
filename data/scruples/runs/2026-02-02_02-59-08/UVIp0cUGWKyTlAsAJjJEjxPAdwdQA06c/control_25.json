The party started first as a small gathering of friends drinking beer, eating pizza, watching movies. Someone posted on our grad Facebook page about this gathering and before I knew it there were like 50-60 people over smoking weed, drinking vodka and a bunch of other shit. I\u2019m not a smoker or drinker, so I left pretty quickly. My friend, who\u2019s also a grade 12 but was 16 at the time of this event, stayed. \n\nNow I\u2019m back home, reading, watching TV whatever. I\u2019m been on my phone, watching people Snapchat and Instagram\u2019s stories. In one, my friend is the focus where she\u2019s chugging a bottle of vodka, in another she\u2019s smoking a joint and in a third, she\u2019s doing shots with a guy. I know that she drove to the party so I text her to call an Uber. When she doesn\u2019t reply, I call her. She picks up and complains that Uber\u2019s too expensive so I offer to call one for her. She hangs up after saying she\u2019s fine to drive. \n\nMaybe 30 minutes later, I see on one of her friend\u2019s Snapchat story, like 5 different videos of her in the car, driving while smoking and drinking and texting on her phone and one video of them in a Macdonald\u2019s that was posted like 2 mins ago. \n\nI call my friend\u2019s mom and tell her what\u2019s happening. She says thanks and hangs up. I don\u2019t hear from her or her daughter for the rest of the night. \n\nShe\u2019s not at school the next day but I hear from from my friends and classmates that her mom and dad grounded her, taking away her phone for like 6 months and selling her car. All day, I had people, mostly her friends and other classmates who\u2019ve posted videos of themselves drinking and doing drugs, (hell one of the girls was a 16 who has a tinder account and who keeps a bottle of vodka in her locker) coming up to me and calling me a dick and an asshole and a bitch for calling her mom on her when she was just having some harmless fun. \n\nNow this was literally the same day when we had a MADD presentation at school. \n\nThe following day, she\u2019s back at school and the first thing she does when she sees me is punch me and call me a \u201cfucking life ruining asshole\u201d because on top of no phone and goodbye car, her parents aren\u2019t letting her attend any house parties and are considering not letting her go to after-prom. \n\nWas I the asshole for doing this? Because honestly, I kinda feel I am. I mean if something had happened and her car crashed and they died and I hadn\u2019t done anything, I\u2019d feel guilty for not doing anything. But now I feel guilty because I got her in trouble with her parents. And we used to be really good friends but in the last month, since she punched me, we haven\u2019t talked at all which kinda hurts. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for calling their friend's mom when they saw her driving under the influence. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe author is 17 years old, and there was a big party where people were drinking and doing drugs. The friend in question is also 17 (since the author mentions she was 16 at the time, but the current time is when the author is 17 and grade 12, so maybe the friend is 17 now too). The friend drove to the party and later tried to drive after drinking, smoking, and texting. The author tried to get her to call an Uber but she refused. Then the author called the mom, which led to the friend getting grounded and losing her phone and car. Some classmates are upset with the author, and the friend punched them. Now they're not talking anymore.\n\nSo the question is, did the author do the wrong thing? On one hand, the friend was engaging in reckless behavior\u2014driving under the influence, which is dangerous. The author tried to intervene and prevent a possible accident. On the other hand, the author didn't have permission to inform the parents, which could be seen as invading privacy. But considering the potential consequences of the friend driving impaired, the author might be justified in their actions to prevent harm.\n\nThe author mentions the MADD presentation at school the same day, which probably highlighted the dangers of drunk driving. That context might support the author's decision. However, the friend's reaction and the fallout with friends complicates things. The key points are the intent to prevent a potential disaster versus the method of confrontation. While the method might be questionable, the intent seems noble. So the answer would likely be B (author not in the wrong) because the action was motivated by concern for safety.\n"
