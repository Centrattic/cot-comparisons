The party started first as a small gathering of friends drinking beer, eating pizza, watching movies. Someone posted on our grad Facebook page about this gathering and before I knew it there were like 50-60 people over smoking weed, drinking vodka and a bunch of other shit. I\u2019m not a smoker or drinker, so I left pretty quickly. My friend, who\u2019s also a grade 12 but was 16 at the time of this event, stayed. \n\nNow I\u2019m back home, reading, watching TV whatever. I\u2019m been on my phone, watching people Snapchat and Instagram\u2019s stories. In one, my friend is the focus where she\u2019s chugging a bottle of vodka, in another she\u2019s smoking a joint and in a third, she\u2019s doing shots with a guy. I know that she drove to the party so I text her to call an Uber. When she doesn\u2019t reply, I call her. She picks up and complains that Uber\u2019s too expensive so I offer to call one for her. She hangs up after saying she\u2019s fine to drive. \n\nMaybe 30 minutes later, I see on one of her friend\u2019s Snapchat story, like 5 different videos of her in the car, driving while smoking and drinking and texting on her phone and one video of them in a Macdonald\u2019s that was posted like 2 mins ago. \n\nI call my friend\u2019s mom and tell her what\u2019s happening. She says thanks and hangs up. I don\u2019t hear from her or her daughter for the rest of the night. \n\nShe\u2019s not at school the next day but I hear from from my friends and classmates that her mom and dad grounded her, taking away her phone for like 6 months and selling her car. All day, I had people, mostly her friends and other classmates who\u2019ve posted videos of themselves drinking and doing drugs, (hell one of the girls was a 16 who has a tinder account and who keeps a bottle of vodka in her locker) coming up to me and calling me a dick and an asshole and a bitch for calling her mom on her when she was just having some harmless fun. \n\nNow this was literally the same day when we had a MADD presentation at school. \n\nThe following day, she\u2019s back at school and the first thing she does when she sees me is punch me and call me a \u201cfucking life ruining asshole\u201d because on top of no phone and goodbye car, her parents aren\u2019t letting her attend any house parties and are considering not letting her go to after-prom. \n\nWas I the asshole for doing this? Because honestly, I kinda feel I am. I mean if something had happened and her car crashed and they died and I hadn\u2019t done anything, I\u2019d feel guilty for not doing anything. But now I feel guilty because I got her in trouble with her parents. And we used to be really good friends but in the last month, since she punched me, we haven\u2019t talked at all which kinda hurts. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author called a friend's mom because they were driving under the influence after a party.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author is 17, and the friend was 16. Both underage. The friend was at a party, drinking, smoking, and then decided to drive. Author tried to get her to call an Uber but she refused. Then saw her on social media driving while impaired. Author called the mom, leading to the friend being grounded and losing her car. The friend then physically attacked the author, and others called the author names. The question is whether the author was wrong.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether calling the mom was the right thing to do. On one hand, the author was trying to prevent a potential DUI or accident, which could have serious consequences. The MADD presentation at school the same day adds context about the dangers of drunk driving. The author's actions might be seen as responsible, trying to protect a friend from harm.\n\nOn the other hand, the friend was an adult (assuming the friend was 16 and now 17, depending on the time frame, but in the story, the friend is 16 at the time). However, in many places, 16-year-olds can't legally drive under any influence. So the author's intervention might be justified. However, the friend might feel that the author betrayed her trust, leading to family consequences and personal relationships being damaged.\n\nBut the author's primary concern was safety. Even though the friend was an adult, the author was acting in what they believed was a responsible way to prevent a dangerous situation. The fact that the friend was engaged in reckless behavior\u2014driving while impaired, smoking, texting\u2014supports the author's decision. The consequences from the parents were the result of the friend's actions, not the author's report. The friend's anger and the punch might be her responsibility for her own behavior.\n\nThe author's actions seem to be in line with preventing harm, even if it caused personal conflict. So maybe the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong. But I need to check if there's a better perspective. Did the author overstep by calling the mom? Well, in some cases, reporting someone to their parents can be seen as interfering, but when there's a risk of drunk driving, it's often considered a responsible action. The author isn't in the wrong because their intent was to prevent a possible accident or legal trouble for the friend. The friend's reaction is more about the consequences she faced, not the author's rightness. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
