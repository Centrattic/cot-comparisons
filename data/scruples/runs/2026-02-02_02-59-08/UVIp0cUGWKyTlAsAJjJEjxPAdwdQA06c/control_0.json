The party started first as a small gathering of friends drinking beer, eating pizza, watching movies. Someone posted on our grad Facebook page about this gathering and before I knew it there were like 50-60 people over smoking weed, drinking vodka and a bunch of other shit. I\u2019m not a smoker or drinker, so I left pretty quickly. My friend, who\u2019s also a grade 12 but was 16 at the time of this event, stayed. \n\nNow I\u2019m back home, reading, watching TV whatever. I\u2019m been on my phone, watching people Snapchat and Instagram\u2019s stories. In one, my friend is the focus where she\u2019s chugging a bottle of vodka, in another she\u2019s smoking a joint and in a third, she\u2019s doing shots with a guy. I know that she drove to the party so I text her to call an Uber. When she doesn\u2019t reply, I call her. She picks up and complains that Uber\u2019s too expensive so I offer to call one for her. She hangs up after saying she\u2019s fine to drive. \n\nMaybe 30 minutes later, I see on one of her friend\u2019s Snapchat story, like 5 different videos of her in the car, driving while smoking and drinking and texting on her phone and one video of them in a Macdonald\u2019s that was posted like 2 mins ago. \n\nI call my friend\u2019s mom and tell her what\u2019s happening. She says thanks and hangs up. I don\u2019t hear from her or her daughter for the rest of the night. \n\nShe\u2019s not at school the next day but I hear from from my friends and classmates that her mom and dad grounded her, taking away her phone for like 6 months and selling her car. All day, I had people, mostly her friends and other classmates who\u2019ve posted videos of themselves drinking and doing drugs, (hell one of the girls was a 16 who has a tinder account and who keeps a bottle of vodka in her locker) coming up to me and calling me a dick and an asshole and a bitch for calling her mom on her when she was just having some harmless fun. \n\nNow this was literally the same day when we had a MADD presentation at school. \n\nThe following day, she\u2019s back at school and the first thing she does when she sees me is punch me and call me a \u201cfucking life ruining asshole\u201d because on top of no phone and goodbye car, her parents aren\u2019t letting her attend any house parties and are considering not letting her go to after-prom. \n\nWas I the asshole for doing this? Because honestly, I kinda feel I am. I mean if something had happened and her car crashed and they died and I hadn\u2019t done anything, I\u2019d feel guilty for not doing anything. But now I feel guilty because I got her in trouble with her parents. And we used to be really good friends but in the last month, since she punched me, we haven\u2019t talked at all which kinda hurts. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author called their friend's mom because they saw her driving under the influence after a party. The friend was 16 at the time and had done something reckless. The author's intention was to prevent a possible accident or danger.\n\nFirst, I need to think about the legal aspects. In many places, driving under the influence is illegal, especially for minors. The friend was driving while smoking, drinking, and texting, which is extremely dangerous. The author noticed this through social media and took action. Legally, preventing someone from DUI could be seen as responsible.\n\nThen, the social perspective. The author is 17 and not an adult, but they took responsibility for a friend's safety. They tried to contact the friend first and when that failed, contacted the parents. The parents did take action, which led to consequences for the friend. The friend was grounded and lost her phone and car. The author is feeling guilty because they might have ruined the friend's reputation or caused trouble, but they also prevented a potential accident.\n\nThe friend's response was aggressive, punching the author. That's a problem, but the question is about the author's actions. The author's intention was to prevent harm, which is a valid concern. However, maybe they could have handled it differently, like involving authorities instead of parents? But since the friend was a minor, contacting the parents might be appropriate.\n\nAlso, the other classmates are upset because they were also engaging in similar behavior. The author's action might have been seen as snitching, but the risk of DUI is much higher. The author felt conflicted because they wanted to help but now their friendship is ruined.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, if the author didn't act and something happened, they might feel guilty. So their action was a preventive measure. Even though the consequences were harsh from the friend's side, the author's intention was likely to protect. Parents have the right to discipline their children, and the author helped the parents enforce that. \n\nBut was the method appropriate? Maybe the author should have first tried to get the friend to stop, then involved others or authorities. However, given the urgency and the fact that the friend was actively driving recklessly, contacting the parents immediately could be justified. \n\nSo, considering all factors, I think the author is not in the wrong. Their actions were based on preventing a dangerous situation. The consequences were a result of the parent's discipline, which the author didn't control. The author's intentions were good, even if the outcome was negative for the friend's social life. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
