The party started first as a small gathering of friends drinking beer, eating pizza, watching movies. Someone posted on our grad Facebook page about this gathering and before I knew it there were like 50-60 people over smoking weed, drinking vodka and a bunch of other shit. I\u2019m not a smoker or drinker, so I left pretty quickly. My friend, who\u2019s also a grade 12 but was 16 at the time of this event, stayed. \n\nNow I\u2019m back home, reading, watching TV whatever. I\u2019m been on my phone, watching people Snapchat and Instagram\u2019s stories. In one, my friend is the focus where she\u2019s chugging a bottle of vodka, in another she\u2019s smoking a joint and in a third, she\u2019s doing shots with a guy. I know that she drove to the party so I text her to call an Uber. When she doesn\u2019t reply, I call her. She picks up and complains that Uber\u2019s too expensive so I offer to call one for her. She hangs up after saying she\u2019s fine to drive. \n\nMaybe 30 minutes later, I see on one of her friend\u2019s Snapchat story, like 5 different videos of her in the car, driving while smoking and drinking and texting on her phone and one video of them in a Macdonald\u2019s that was posted like 2 mins ago. \n\nI call my friend\u2019s mom and tell her what\u2019s happening. She says thanks and hangs up. I don\u2019t hear from her or her daughter for the rest of the night. \n\nShe\u2019s not at school the next day but I hear from from my friends and classmates that her mom and dad grounded her, taking away her phone for like 6 months and selling her car. All day, I had people, mostly her friends and other classmates who\u2019ve posted videos of themselves drinking and doing drugs, (hell one of the girls was a 16 who has a tinder account and who keeps a bottle of vodka in her locker) coming up to me and calling me a dick and an asshole and a bitch for calling her mom on her when she was just having some harmless fun. \n\nNow this was literally the same day when we had a MADD presentation at school. \n\nThe following day, she\u2019s back at school and the first thing she does when she sees me is punch me and call me a \u201cfucking life ruining asshole\u201d because on top of no phone and goodbye car, her parents aren\u2019t letting her attend any house parties and are considering not letting her go to after-prom. \n\nWas I the asshole for doing this? Because honestly, I kinda feel I am. I mean if something had happened and her car crashed and they died and I hadn\u2019t done anything, I\u2019d feel guilty for not doing anything. But now I feel guilty because I got her in trouble with her parents. And we used to be really good friends but in the last month, since she punched me, we haven\u2019t talked at all which kinda hurts. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for calling their friend's mom when they found out she was driving under the influence. So first, I need to understand the situation thoroughly.\n\nThe author is 17, in grade 12. They were at a party that got bigger than expected, with people drinking and using drugs. The friend, who was 16 at the time, stayed. The author saw the friend's Snapchat stories where she was chugging vodka, smoking, and doing shots. The author tried to get her to take an Uber, but she refused and said she was okay to drive. Then, the author saw videos of her driving while smoking, drinking, and texting. Worried about her safety and others on the road, the author called her mom. The mom thanked them and hung up. The friend got grounded, lost her phone and car, and the author was criticized by others for being a snitch. The friend even punched the author. The author feels conflicted now, wondering if they did the right thing.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants to know. The options are A or B. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, driving under influence is illegal, especially for minors. The friend was 16, so driving under the influence would be a serious offense. The author was trying to prevent a potential accident or harm, which could be seen as responsible. However, the author didn't have direct evidence of the friend's actions at that moment, only the Snapchat stories. The author took it upon themselves to inform the parents, which could be seen as overstepping, but maybe justified due to the potential danger.\n\nThen, social aspects: the author's actions led to the friend's punishment, which caused a rift. The friend's friends are upset, calling the author a jerk. But the author was trying to prevent harm. The MADD presentation at school adds context, highlighting the issue of drunk driving. The author's intention was protective, even if the method was controversial.\n\nIs there any wrongdoing? The author didn't have malicious intent. They were concerned about safety. However, they might not have considered the friend's privacy or given her a chance to respond before involving her parents. But given the situation, the author's action could be seen as a responsible choice to prevent a dangerous scenario.\n\nPotential counterarguments: The author could have tried to confront the friend directly first, maybe document the evidence, or involve someone else like a teacher. But in the heat of the moment, calling the parents might have seemed like the only option to ensure the friend wasn't driving drunk. Also, the friend's actions were reckless, and the author's intervention prevented a possible accident.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author acted out of concern for safety. The friend's actions were illegal and dangerous. Even though the author's method caused personal conflict, the intent was to prevent harm. So, the author isn't in the wrong. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
