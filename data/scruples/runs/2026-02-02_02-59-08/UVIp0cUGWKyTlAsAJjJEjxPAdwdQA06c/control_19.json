The party started first as a small gathering of friends drinking beer, eating pizza, watching movies. Someone posted on our grad Facebook page about this gathering and before I knew it there were like 50-60 people over smoking weed, drinking vodka and a bunch of other shit. I\u2019m not a smoker or drinker, so I left pretty quickly. My friend, who\u2019s also a grade 12 but was 16 at the time of this event, stayed. \n\nNow I\u2019m back home, reading, watching TV whatever. I\u2019m been on my phone, watching people Snapchat and Instagram\u2019s stories. In one, my friend is the focus where she\u2019s chugging a bottle of vodka, in another she\u2019s smoking a joint and in a third, she\u2019s doing shots with a guy. I know that she drove to the party so I text her to call an Uber. When she doesn\u2019t reply, I call her. She picks up and complains that Uber\u2019s too expensive so I offer to call one for her. She hangs up after saying she\u2019s fine to drive. \n\nMaybe 30 minutes later, I see on one of her friend\u2019s Snapchat story, like 5 different videos of her in the car, driving while smoking and drinking and texting on her phone and one video of them in a Macdonald\u2019s that was posted like 2 mins ago. \n\nI call my friend\u2019s mom and tell her what\u2019s happening. She says thanks and hangs up. I don\u2019t hear from her or her daughter for the rest of the night. \n\nShe\u2019s not at school the next day but I hear from from my friends and classmates that her mom and dad grounded her, taking away her phone for like 6 months and selling her car. All day, I had people, mostly her friends and other classmates who\u2019ve posted videos of themselves drinking and doing drugs, (hell one of the girls was a 16 who has a tinder account and who keeps a bottle of vodka in her locker) coming up to me and calling me a dick and an asshole and a bitch for calling her mom on her when she was just having some harmless fun. \n\nNow this was literally the same day when we had a MADD presentation at school. \n\nThe following day, she\u2019s back at school and the first thing she does when she sees me is punch me and call me a \u201cfucking life ruining asshole\u201d because on top of no phone and goodbye car, her parents aren\u2019t letting her attend any house parties and are considering not letting her go to after-prom. \n\nWas I the asshole for doing this? Because honestly, I kinda feel I am. I mean if something had happened and her car crashed and they died and I hadn\u2019t done anything, I\u2019d feel guilty for not doing anything. But now I feel guilty because I got her in trouble with her parents. And we used to be really good friends but in the last month, since she punched me, we haven\u2019t talked at all which kinda hurts. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a 17-year-old who called their friend's mom because the friend was driving under the influence after a party. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The friend was driving while smoking, drinking, and texting, which is extremely dangerous. The author tried to get her to take an Uber but she refused. The author then called her mom, leading to the friend being grounded and losing her car. The friend and others are upset, and now they're no longer friends.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author did the right thing. On one hand, the author prevented a potential DUI or accident, which could have had serious consequences. DUID is a big issue, especially with minors. The author might have acted to protect their friend's life. The MADD presentation at school the same day adds context about the dangers of drunk driving.\n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't directly confront the friend in person but instead went to her parents. Some might argue that they should have handled it differently, like calling the police instead of the parents. However, the friend was a minor, so the parents are legally responsible. The author might have felt that calling the parents was the best way to intervene without involving law enforcement, which could be more severe.\n\nThe friend's reaction was violent, punching the author, which is clearly wrong. The author's actions were meant to prevent harm, but it led to personal conflict. The friends are now estranged, which is sad, but the author's intention was protective. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the key is the intent versus the consequences. The author's intent was to prevent a dangerous situation. The consequences were the friend getting in trouble and the friendship breaking down. However, the author's actions led to positive outcomes (friend grounded, no accident) but negative personal consequences. \n\nIn terms of legal and safety aspects, the author did the right thing by stopping a minor from driving under the influence. The friend's actions were reckless, and the author's intervention prevented potential tragedy. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
