The party started first as a small gathering of friends drinking beer, eating pizza, watching movies. Someone posted on our grad Facebook page about this gathering and before I knew it there were like 50-60 people over smoking weed, drinking vodka and a bunch of other shit. I\u2019m not a smoker or drinker, so I left pretty quickly. My friend, who\u2019s also a grade 12 but was 16 at the time of this event, stayed. \n\nNow I\u2019m back home, reading, watching TV whatever. I\u2019m been on my phone, watching people Snapchat and Instagram\u2019s stories. In one, my friend is the focus where she\u2019s chugging a bottle of vodka, in another she\u2019s smoking a joint and in a third, she\u2019s doing shots with a guy. I know that she drove to the party so I text her to call an Uber. When she doesn\u2019t reply, I call her. She picks up and complains that Uber\u2019s too expensive so I offer to call one for her. She hangs up after saying she\u2019s fine to drive. \n\nMaybe 30 minutes later, I see on one of her friend\u2019s Snapchat story, like 5 different videos of her in the car, driving while smoking and drinking and texting on her phone and one video of them in a Macdonald\u2019s that was posted like 2 mins ago. \n\nI call my friend\u2019s mom and tell her what\u2019s happening. She says thanks and hangs up. I don\u2019t hear from her or her daughter for the rest of the night. \n\nShe\u2019s not at school the next day but I hear from from my friends and classmates that her mom and dad grounded her, taking away her phone for like 6 months and selling her car. All day, I had people, mostly her friends and other classmates who\u2019ve posted videos of themselves drinking and doing drugs, (hell one of the girls was a 16 who has a tinder account and who keeps a bottle of vodka in her locker) coming up to me and calling me a dick and an asshole and a bitch for calling her mom on her when she was just having some harmless fun. \n\nNow this was literally the same day when we had a MADD presentation at school. \n\nThe following day, she\u2019s back at school and the first thing she does when she sees me is punch me and call me a \u201cfucking life ruining asshole\u201d because on top of no phone and goodbye car, her parents aren\u2019t letting her attend any house parties and are considering not letting her go to after-prom. \n\nWas I the asshole for doing this? Because honestly, I kinda feel I am. I mean if something had happened and her car crashed and they died and I hadn\u2019t done anything, I\u2019d feel guilty for not doing anything. But now I feel guilty because I got her in trouble with her parents. And we used to be really good friends but in the last month, since she punched me, we haven\u2019t talked at all which kinda hurts. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author did the right thing by calling someone's mom when they were driving under the influence.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author is 17, at a party where it got big, and their friend was engaging in risky behavior\u2014drinking, smoking, driving. The author tried to get an Uber for the friend, who declined. Later, the author saw the friend driving while impaired and called her mom. The parents took action, grounding her and taking away her car. The friend then punched the author and they lost contact.\n\nSo, the main points here. Driving under the influence is a huge risk. The author was trying to prevent a potential accident or worse. The friend was a minor (16 at the time) and involved in dangerous activities. The author's actions led to the friend getting grounded, but maybe that was necessary to protect her. \n\nBut then, there's the social aspect. The friend's peers are upset, calling the author an asshole. The author is now feeling guilty for both inaction (if something had happened) and action (getting the friend in trouble). The friend's reaction was violent, which complicates things.\n\nThe key is whether the author acted responsibly. Preventing someone from driving drunk is generally seen as the right thing to do. However, the method\u2014telling a parent without trying to intervene directly, like stopping her themselves or calling the police, might be a point of contention. \n\nThe author did try to get her to take an Uber first. When that failed, they saw her driving while impaired and then informed the parents. The parents' response was strict, but that's their choice. The author's intent was to prevent harm. \n\nOn the other hand, the friend might have felt betrayed, which led to her punching the author. The social backlash is tough, but the author's action was to prevent a potentially fatal accident. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the question is if the author is the asshole. The parents' actions are their responsibility. The friend's reaction is her own, but the author's intent was protective. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), because the author was trying to prevent a dangerous situation. Even though it caused a fallout, the action was for safety. The friend's friends being upset doesn't make the author the asshole. The parents might have overreacted, but the author's choice was to protect someone.\n"
