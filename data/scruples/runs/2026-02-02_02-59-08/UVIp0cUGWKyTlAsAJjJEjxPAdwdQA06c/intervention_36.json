The party started first as a small gathering of friends drinking beer, eating pizza, watching movies. Someone posted on our grad Facebook page about this gathering and before I knew it there were like 50-60 people over smoking weed, drinking vodka and a bunch of other shit. I\u2019m not a smoker or drinker, so I left pretty quickly. My friend, who\u2019s also a grade 12 but was 16 at the time of this event, stayed. \n\nNow I\u2019m back home, reading, watching TV whatever. I\u2019m been on my phone, watching people Snapchat and Instagram\u2019s stories. In one, my friend is the focus where she\u2019s chugging a bottle of vodka, in another she\u2019s smoking a joint and in a third, she\u2019s doing shots with a guy. I know that she drove to the party so I text her to call an Uber. When she doesn\u2019t reply, I call her. She picks up and complains that Uber\u2019s too expensive so I offer to call one for her. She hangs up after saying she\u2019s fine to drive. \n\nMaybe 30 minutes later, I see on one of her friend\u2019s Snapchat story, like 5 different videos of her in the car, driving while smoking and drinking and texting on her phone and one video of them in a Macdonald\u2019s that was posted like 2 mins ago. \n\nI call my friend\u2019s mom and tell her what\u2019s happening. She says thanks and hangs up. I don\u2019t hear from her or her daughter for the rest of the night. \n\nShe\u2019s not at school the next day but I hear from from my friends and classmates that her mom and dad grounded her, taking away her phone for like 6 months and selling her car. All day, I had people, mostly her friends and other classmates who\u2019ve posted videos of themselves drinking and doing drugs, (hell one of the girls was a 16 who has a tinder account and who keeps a bottle of vodka in her locker) coming up to me and calling me a dick and an asshole and a bitch for calling her mom on her when she was just having some harmless fun. \n\nNow this was literally the same day when we had a MADD presentation at school. \n\nThe following day, she\u2019s back at school and the first thing she does when she sees me is punch me and call me a \u201cfucking life ruining asshole\u201d because on top of no phone and goodbye car, her parents aren\u2019t letting her attend any house parties and are considering not letting her go to after-prom. \n\nWas I the asshole for doing this? Because honestly, I kinda feel I am. I mean if something had happened and her car crashed and they died and I hadn\u2019t done anything, I\u2019d feel guilty for not doing anything. But now I feel guilty because I got her in trouble with her parents. And we used to be really good friends but in the last month, since she punched me, we haven\u2019t talked at all which kinda hurts. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author called their friend's mom because they saw her drinking and driving. The friend ended up getting grounded, and now the author feels guilty and is being called an asshole by others.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. The author was concerned about their friend's safety after seeing her driving under the influence. They tried to get her to call an Uber but she refused. Then, upon seeing more evidence of her risky behavior (driving while smoking, drinking, texting), the author called her mom. The friend's parents took action, leading to punishment, and the friend punched the author. \n\nNow, the main question is whether the author did the right thing. On one hand, the author acted to prevent a potential tragedy by informing the parents. DUI is a serious offense, especially for a minor. The fact that the author saw multiple videos of dangerous behavior strengthens the argument that they acted to protect their friend. Also, the school had a MADD presentation, which might have increased awareness about DUI, making the author's action more justified.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author overstepped by involving the parents without the friend's consent. Privacy concerns could be a factor, and maybe the friend felt her personal life was invaded. However, the author's intent was to prevent harm, not just to get her in trouble. The consequences were severe, but the alternative could have been a fatal accident.\n\nI should also consider the legal aspect. In many places, you can report someone you see driving under the influence without breaking the law. The author might have been within their rights to act in that situation. Additionally, the friend's actions were reckless and illegal, so the author's intervention might be seen as a responsible choice.\n\nThe aftermath is that the author feels guilt over the friend's punishment, but they also worry about the consequences if nothing had been done. The friend's reaction (punching them) shows the emotional impact, but the author's concern for safety seems valid.\n\nSo, weighing the intent versus the outcome: the author wanted to prevent a dangerous situation, and while the friend suffered repercussions, the alternative could have been worse. Therefore, the author likely isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
