The party started first as a small gathering of friends drinking beer, eating pizza, watching movies. Someone posted on our grad Facebook page about this gathering and before I knew it there were like 50-60 people over smoking weed, drinking vodka and a bunch of other shit. I\u2019m not a smoker or drinker, so I left pretty quickly. My friend, who\u2019s also a grade 12 but was 16 at the time of this event, stayed. \n\nNow I\u2019m back home, reading, watching TV whatever. I\u2019m been on my phone, watching people Snapchat and Instagram\u2019s stories. In one, my friend is the focus where she\u2019s chugging a bottle of vodka, in another she\u2019s smoking a joint and in a third, she\u2019s doing shots with a guy. I know that she drove to the party so I text her to call an Uber. When she doesn\u2019t reply, I call her. She picks up and complains that Uber\u2019s too expensive so I offer to call one for her. She hangs up after saying she\u2019s fine to drive. \n\nMaybe 30 minutes later, I see on one of her friend\u2019s Snapchat story, like 5 different videos of her in the car, driving while smoking and drinking and texting on her phone and one video of them in a Macdonald\u2019s that was posted like 2 mins ago. \n\nI call my friend\u2019s mom and tell her what\u2019s happening. She says thanks and hangs up. I don\u2019t hear from her or her daughter for the rest of the night. \n\nShe\u2019s not at school the next day but I hear from from my friends and classmates that her mom and dad grounded her, taking away her phone for like 6 months and selling her car. All day, I had people, mostly her friends and other classmates who\u2019ve posted videos of themselves drinking and doing drugs, (hell one of the girls was a 16 who has a tinder account and who keeps a bottle of vodka in her locker) coming up to me and calling me a dick and an asshole and a bitch for calling her mom on her when she was just having some harmless fun. \n\nNow this was literally the same day when we had a MADD presentation at school. \n\nThe following day, she\u2019s back at school and the first thing she does when she sees me is punch me and call me a \u201cfucking life ruining asshole\u201d because on top of no phone and goodbye car, her parents aren\u2019t letting her attend any house parties and are considering not letting her go to after-prom. \n\nWas I the asshole for doing this? Because honestly, I kinda feel I am. I mean if something had happened and her car crashed and they died and I hadn\u2019t done anything, I\u2019d feel guilty for not doing anything. But now I feel guilty because I got her in trouble with her parents. And we used to be really good friends but in the last month, since she punched me, we haven\u2019t talked at all which kinda hurts. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who called their friend's mom was in the wrong. The situation involves underage drinking, driving under the influence, and the friend not taking the threat seriously.\n\nSo, the author was at a party, saw their friend posting about drinking and driving, and tried to get an Uber for her. When she refused, the author called her mom. The friend ended up being grounded, lost her phone and car, and even punched the author afterward. Now the author feels guilty because their friend is upset and they used to be friends. Others are calling the author an asshole for interfering.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. The friend was 16, under the age of majority, and driving while under the influence of alcohol and drugs. That's a serious legal issue. Driving under the influence can lead to fatal accidents, so preventing that is a big concern. The author's action was to prevent a potential tragedy.\n\nBut then there's the social aspect. The author's friend didn't appreciate the intervention, and others are upset because they think the author ruined her fun. The author might feel like they overstepped, but they were trying to prevent harm. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the friend is at fault for her actions, but the author acted in what they believed was a responsible way. However, the method of calling the mom could be questioned. Was there a better way to handle it? Maybe confronting the friend directly or getting someone else to help. But given the urgency of a drunk driver, the author might have felt it was necessary.\n\nThe key here is the potential danger versus the consequences faced by the friend. The author's action led to her being grounded and losing her phone and car. But those are the parent's decisions, not the author's. The author's intent was to prevent harm, not to punish. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If you prioritize preventing a possible accident, then no. But if you consider the social fallout and the friend's punishment, maybe. However, the author's actions were in good faith, trying to save lives. The real fault lies with the friend for her choices. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they took action to prevent a dangerous situation, even if it had consequences.\n"
