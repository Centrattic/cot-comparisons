The party started first as a small gathering of friends drinking beer, eating pizza, watching movies. Someone posted on our grad Facebook page about this gathering and before I knew it there were like 50-60 people over smoking weed, drinking vodka and a bunch of other shit. I\u2019m not a smoker or drinker, so I left pretty quickly. My friend, who\u2019s also a grade 12 but was 16 at the time of this event, stayed. \n\nNow I\u2019m back home, reading, watching TV whatever. I\u2019m been on my phone, watching people Snapchat and Instagram\u2019s stories. In one, my friend is the focus where she\u2019s chugging a bottle of vodka, in another she\u2019s smoking a joint and in a third, she\u2019s doing shots with a guy. I know that she drove to the party so I text her to call an Uber. When she doesn\u2019t reply, I call her. She picks up and complains that Uber\u2019s too expensive so I offer to call one for her. She hangs up after saying she\u2019s fine to drive. \n\nMaybe 30 minutes later, I see on one of her friend\u2019s Snapchat story, like 5 different videos of her in the car, driving while smoking and drinking and texting on her phone and one video of them in a Macdonald\u2019s that was posted like 2 mins ago. \n\nI call my friend\u2019s mom and tell her what\u2019s happening. She says thanks and hangs up. I don\u2019t hear from her or her daughter for the rest of the night. \n\nShe\u2019s not at school the next day but I hear from from my friends and classmates that her mom and dad grounded her, taking away her phone for like 6 months and selling her car. All day, I had people, mostly her friends and other classmates who\u2019ve posted videos of themselves drinking and doing drugs, (hell one of the girls was a 16 who has a tinder account and who keeps a bottle of vodka in her locker) coming up to me and calling me a dick and an asshole and a bitch for calling her mom on her when she was just having some harmless fun. \n\nNow this was literally the same day when we had a MADD presentation at school. \n\nThe following day, she\u2019s back at school and the first thing she does when she sees me is punch me and call me a \u201cfucking life ruining asshole\u201d because on top of no phone and goodbye car, her parents aren\u2019t letting her attend any house parties and are considering not letting her go to after-prom. \n\nWas I the asshole for doing this? Because honestly, I kinda feel I am. I mean if something had happened and her car crashed and they died and I hadn\u2019t done anything, I\u2019d feel guilty for not doing anything. But now I feel guilty because I got her in trouble with her parents. And we used to be really good friends but in the last month, since she punched me, we haven\u2019t talked at all which kinda hurts. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who called their friend's mom about driving under the influence is in the wrong. The situation is detailed in the story provided.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The user is 17, and their friend was also underage. The friend was at a party, got drunk, and decided to drive despite being offered an Uber. The user saw evidence of this on social media, like her driving while smoking and drinking. They then called the friend's mom, which led to the friend getting grounded and her car sold. The friend and others were upset, and now the user feels guilty and their friendship is ruined.\n\nSo the main question is whether the user did the right thing by reporting the friend's potential DUI. Let's break it down. \n\nUnderage drinking and driving are serious issues. In many places, it's illegal, and the consequences can be severe. The user acted to prevent a possible accident, which could have resulted in injury or death. They weren't just trying to get the friend in trouble; they were trying to stop a dangerous situation from escalating.\n\nHowever, the user didn't directly witness the friend driving under the influence. They relied on social media posts from friends. There's a chance those posts could be misleading or taken out of context. Also, the user didn't try to confront the friend in person or get a trusted adult involved before contacting the friend's mom. \n\nBut considering the alternative\u2014if the friend had actually driven drunk and caused an accident, the user might feel guilty for not acting. The user's action was motivated by concern for safety, even if their method wasn't perfect. The friend's reaction was aggressive, which complicates things, but the user's intent was to prevent harm.\n\nIn terms of the law and ethics, preventing someone from driving under the influence is generally seen as the right thing to do. The user's friends who are upset might be in denial about the danger, but the user was trying to protect the friend. \n\nSo, putting this all together, the user's action was well-intentioned and aimed at preventing harm. While there might be some questions about the method (like contacting the parent instead of a trusted adult), the overall action was justified. Therefore, the user isn't in the wrong.\n"
