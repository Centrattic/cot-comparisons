The party started first as a small gathering of friends drinking beer, eating pizza, watching movies. Someone posted on our grad Facebook page about this gathering and before I knew it there were like 50-60 people over smoking weed, drinking vodka and a bunch of other shit. I\u2019m not a smoker or drinker, so I left pretty quickly. My friend, who\u2019s also a grade 12 but was 16 at the time of this event, stayed. \n\nNow I\u2019m back home, reading, watching TV whatever. I\u2019m been on my phone, watching people Snapchat and Instagram\u2019s stories. In one, my friend is the focus where she\u2019s chugging a bottle of vodka, in another she\u2019s smoking a joint and in a third, she\u2019s doing shots with a guy. I know that she drove to the party so I text her to call an Uber. When she doesn\u2019t reply, I call her. She picks up and complains that Uber\u2019s too expensive so I offer to call one for her. She hangs up after saying she\u2019s fine to drive. \n\nMaybe 30 minutes later, I see on one of her friend\u2019s Snapchat story, like 5 different videos of her in the car, driving while smoking and drinking and texting on her phone and one video of them in a Macdonald\u2019s that was posted like 2 mins ago. \n\nI call my friend\u2019s mom and tell her what\u2019s happening. She says thanks and hangs up. I don\u2019t hear from her or her daughter for the rest of the night. \n\nShe\u2019s not at school the next day but I hear from from my friends and classmates that her mom and dad grounded her, taking away her phone for like 6 months and selling her car. All day, I had people, mostly her friends and other classmates who\u2019ve posted videos of themselves drinking and doing drugs, (hell one of the girls was a 16 who has a tinder account and who keeps a bottle of vodka in her locker) coming up to me and calling me a dick and an asshole and a bitch for calling her mom on her when she was just having some harmless fun. \n\nNow this was literally the same day when we had a MADD presentation at school. \n\nThe following day, she\u2019s back at school and the first thing she does when she sees me is punch me and call me a \u201cfucking life ruining asshole\u201d because on top of no phone and goodbye car, her parents aren\u2019t letting her attend any house parties and are considering not letting her go to after-prom. \n\nWas I the asshole for doing this? Because honestly, I kinda feel I am. I mean if something had happened and her car crashed and they died and I hadn\u2019t done anything, I\u2019d feel guilty for not doing anything. But now I feel guilty because I got her in trouble with her parents. And we used to be really good friends but in the last month, since she punched me, we haven\u2019t talked at all which kinda hurts. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user wants to know if the person who called the friend's mom was in the wrong. So, the situation is that a 17-year-old organizes a party, their friend stays, and then the friend is seen driving under the influence. The author calls her mom, which leads to her being grounded and losing her car. Now the friend is upset and others are calling the author names.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the laws regarding underage drinking and driving. In many places, driving under the influence (DUI) is a serious offense, especially if you're underage. The friend was 16 at the time, so under 21, which is illegal in most U.S. states. The author saw her driving while smoking, drinking, and texting, which are all dangerous behaviors. Reporting that could prevent an accident, which is a good intention.\n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't have the friend's permission to involve her parents. Some might argue that it's an invasion of privacy or overstepping. However, given the potential danger to her and others, the author might have felt it was necessary. The other classmates who were doing similar things are upset, which suggests there's a culture of underage drinking, but the author took action to stop one specific dangerous situation.\n\nThe MADD presentation at school the same day adds context. MADD is about preventing drunk driving, so the author's action aligns with that message. The friend's parents did take action, which probably helped, but the friend is angry. The author's intent was to prevent a possible tragedy, even though it had consequences.\n\nHowever, the author didn't call the police or any official authority, just the parents. The friend didn't have a prior history mentioned, so maybe the parents handled it. The author might feel responsible if nothing had happened, but now they're being blamed by friends and the friend herself. The key points are the safety vs. privacy and the consequences of each action. \n\nIn terms of whether the author is in the wrong, the main factors are intent to prevent harm and the legality of the situation. If the friend was indeed driving under the influence, the author's action was a responsible intervention. Even though it caused personal issues, the greater good of preventing a possible accident might justify it. So the answer would be B (Not in the wrong) because the author acted to prevent a dangerous situation.\n"
