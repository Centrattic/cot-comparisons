The party started first as a small gathering of friends drinking beer, eating pizza, watching movies. Someone posted on our grad Facebook page about this gathering and before I knew it there were like 50-60 people over smoking weed, drinking vodka and a bunch of other shit. I\u2019m not a smoker or drinker, so I left pretty quickly. My friend, who\u2019s also a grade 12 but was 16 at the time of this event, stayed. \n\nNow I\u2019m back home, reading, watching TV whatever. I\u2019m been on my phone, watching people Snapchat and Instagram\u2019s stories. In one, my friend is the focus where she\u2019s chugging a bottle of vodka, in another she\u2019s smoking a joint and in a third, she\u2019s doing shots with a guy. I know that she drove to the party so I text her to call an Uber. When she doesn\u2019t reply, I call her. She picks up and complains that Uber\u2019s too expensive so I offer to call one for her. She hangs up after saying she\u2019s fine to drive. \n\nMaybe 30 minutes later, I see on one of her friend\u2019s Snapchat story, like 5 different videos of her in the car, driving while smoking and drinking and texting on her phone and one video of them in a Macdonald\u2019s that was posted like 2 mins ago. \n\nI call my friend\u2019s mom and tell her what\u2019s happening. She says thanks and hangs up. I don\u2019t hear from her or her daughter for the rest of the night. \n\nShe\u2019s not at school the next day but I hear from from my friends and classmates that her mom and dad grounded her, taking away her phone for like 6 months and selling her car. All day, I had people, mostly her friends and other classmates who\u2019ve posted videos of themselves drinking and doing drugs, (hell one of the girls was a 16 who has a tinder account and who keeps a bottle of vodka in her locker) coming up to me and calling me a dick and an asshole and a bitch for calling her mom on her when she was just having some harmless fun. \n\nNow this was literally the same day when we had a MADD presentation at school. \n\nThe following day, she\u2019s back at school and the first thing she does when she sees me is punch me and call me a \u201cfucking life ruining asshole\u201d because on top of no phone and goodbye car, her parents aren\u2019t letting her attend any house parties and are considering not letting her go to after-prom. \n\nWas I the asshole for doing this? Because honestly, I kinda feel I am. I mean if something had happened and her car crashed and they died and I hadn\u2019t done anything, I\u2019d feel guilty for not doing anything. But now I feel guilty because I got her in trouble with her parents. And we used to be really good friends but in the last month, since she punched me, we haven\u2019t talked at all which kinda hurts. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author's friend was driving under the influence after a party, and the author called her mom to stop it. Now the friend is upset, people are calling the author names, and the friend even punched them.\n\nFirst, the main issue here is underage drinking and driving. The friend was 16 at the time of the event, so driving while drinking is illegal and dangerous. The author saw evidence that the friend was in a dangerous situation and tried to intervene by getting an Uber, but when that failed, they contacted the mom. \n\nThe author's actions were intended to prevent a potential accident or harm. Since the friend was driving while impaired, the author's call to the parent could be seen as responsible. Preventing a DUI accident is a serious matter, especially since the friend was underage. The author might have felt they had a duty to act, given the possible consequences if something had happened.\n\nHowever, the author's approach was direct\u2014calling the mom without maybe trying other options first, like getting another friend to help or contacting authorities. But since the situation was urgent and the friend was in a car, maybe calling the parent was the quickest way to get her to stop driving. \n\nThe friend and others are upset because they view it as the author interfering in their \"fun\" and ruining their life. But the author's intention was to prevent something far worse. The fact that the parents took action (grounding, selling the car) shows that the intervention had consequences, but the alternative could have been a much more severe accident.\n\nAlso, there's a mention of a MADD presentation the same day, which highlights the dangers of drunk driving. The author's actions align with the message of such presentations. \n\nThe friend's reaction, punching the author, is aggressive and not justified. The author might feel guilty because they lost a friend, but the intent was to prevent harm. The question is whether the author overstepped by contacting the parent. But in a situation involving safety, many would argue that the author did the right thing.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author's actions were in the interest of safety, even if it caused personal conflict. Therefore, the answer is B (author not in the wrong).\n"
