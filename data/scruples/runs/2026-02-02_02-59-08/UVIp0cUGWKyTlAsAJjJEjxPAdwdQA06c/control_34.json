The party started first as a small gathering of friends drinking beer, eating pizza, watching movies. Someone posted on our grad Facebook page about this gathering and before I knew it there were like 50-60 people over smoking weed, drinking vodka and a bunch of other shit. I\u2019m not a smoker or drinker, so I left pretty quickly. My friend, who\u2019s also a grade 12 but was 16 at the time of this event, stayed. \n\nNow I\u2019m back home, reading, watching TV whatever. I\u2019m been on my phone, watching people Snapchat and Instagram\u2019s stories. In one, my friend is the focus where she\u2019s chugging a bottle of vodka, in another she\u2019s smoking a joint and in a third, she\u2019s doing shots with a guy. I know that she drove to the party so I text her to call an Uber. When she doesn\u2019t reply, I call her. She picks up and complains that Uber\u2019s too expensive so I offer to call one for her. She hangs up after saying she\u2019s fine to drive. \n\nMaybe 30 minutes later, I see on one of her friend\u2019s Snapchat story, like 5 different videos of her in the car, driving while smoking and drinking and texting on her phone and one video of them in a Macdonald\u2019s that was posted like 2 mins ago. \n\nI call my friend\u2019s mom and tell her what\u2019s happening. She says thanks and hangs up. I don\u2019t hear from her or her daughter for the rest of the night. \n\nShe\u2019s not at school the next day but I hear from from my friends and classmates that her mom and dad grounded her, taking away her phone for like 6 months and selling her car. All day, I had people, mostly her friends and other classmates who\u2019ve posted videos of themselves drinking and doing drugs, (hell one of the girls was a 16 who has a tinder account and who keeps a bottle of vodka in her locker) coming up to me and calling me a dick and an asshole and a bitch for calling her mom on her when she was just having some harmless fun. \n\nNow this was literally the same day when we had a MADD presentation at school. \n\nThe following day, she\u2019s back at school and the first thing she does when she sees me is punch me and call me a \u201cfucking life ruining asshole\u201d because on top of no phone and goodbye car, her parents aren\u2019t letting her attend any house parties and are considering not letting her go to after-prom. \n\nWas I the asshole for doing this? Because honestly, I kinda feel I am. I mean if something had happened and her car crashed and they died and I hadn\u2019t done anything, I\u2019d feel guilty for not doing anything. But now I feel guilty because I got her in trouble with her parents. And we used to be really good friends but in the last month, since she punched me, we haven\u2019t talked at all which kinda hurts. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is 17 and at a house party where things got out of hand. They left early because they don't drink or smoke. Their friend, who was 16 at the time, stayed and started posting stories showing her drinking, smoking, and doing shots. The friend drives, so the author texts her to get an Uber. When she doesn't respond, the author calls her, but she refuses, saying Uber is too expensive. Then, the author sees Snapchat videos of her driving while doing all those things. So they call her mom, who thanks them and hangs up. The friend gets grounded, loses her phone and car, and the author gets called names by others. The friend punches the author later.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's think about key points. The friend was underage (16) and driving under the influence, which is illegal and dangerous. The author tried to intervene by suggesting Uber, which the friend refused. Then, seeing her driving while impaired, the author contacted her mom. The friend's parents took action, which prevented potential harm. The author's actions were intended to prevent a possible accident or legal trouble. However, the author didn't directly report to authorities but called the mom instead. Was that the right move? In some cases, calling parents might be appropriate for underage drinking and DUI. The author might not be in the wrong because they acted to prevent harm, even if it caused personal conflict. The friend's actions were reckless, and the author took responsibility by informing her parents. While the method might be debatable, the intent was protective. So the answer is B.\n"
