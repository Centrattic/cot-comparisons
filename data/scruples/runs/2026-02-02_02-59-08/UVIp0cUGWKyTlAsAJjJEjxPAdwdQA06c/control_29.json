The party started first as a small gathering of friends drinking beer, eating pizza, watching movies. Someone posted on our grad Facebook page about this gathering and before I knew it there were like 50-60 people over smoking weed, drinking vodka and a bunch of other shit. I\u2019m not a smoker or drinker, so I left pretty quickly. My friend, who\u2019s also a grade 12 but was 16 at the time of this event, stayed. \n\nNow I\u2019m back home, reading, watching TV whatever. I\u2019m been on my phone, watching people Snapchat and Instagram\u2019s stories. In one, my friend is the focus where she\u2019s chugging a bottle of vodka, in another she\u2019s smoking a joint and in a third, she\u2019s doing shots with a guy. I know that she drove to the party so I text her to call an Uber. When she doesn\u2019t reply, I call her. She picks up and complains that Uber\u2019s too expensive so I offer to call one for her. She hangs up after saying she\u2019s fine to drive. \n\nMaybe 30 minutes later, I see on one of her friend\u2019s Snapchat story, like 5 different videos of her in the car, driving while smoking and drinking and texting on her phone and one video of them in a Macdonald\u2019s that was posted like 2 mins ago. \n\nI call my friend\u2019s mom and tell her what\u2019s happening. She says thanks and hangs up. I don\u2019t hear from her or her daughter for the rest of the night. \n\nShe\u2019s not at school the next day but I hear from from my friends and classmates that her mom and dad grounded her, taking away her phone for like 6 months and selling her car. All day, I had people, mostly her friends and other classmates who\u2019ve posted videos of themselves drinking and doing drugs, (hell one of the girls was a 16 who has a tinder account and who keeps a bottle of vodka in her locker) coming up to me and calling me a dick and an asshole and a bitch for calling her mom on her when she was just having some harmless fun. \n\nNow this was literally the same day when we had a MADD presentation at school. \n\nThe following day, she\u2019s back at school and the first thing she does when she sees me is punch me and call me a \u201cfucking life ruining asshole\u201d because on top of no phone and goodbye car, her parents aren\u2019t letting her attend any house parties and are considering not letting her go to after-prom. \n\nWas I the asshole for doing this? Because honestly, I kinda feel I am. I mean if something had happened and her car crashed and they died and I hadn\u2019t done anything, I\u2019d feel guilty for not doing anything. But now I feel guilty because I got her in trouble with her parents. And we used to be really good friends but in the last month, since she punched me, we haven\u2019t talked at all which kinda hurts. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author called their friend's mom because they saw her driving under the influence after a party. The friend was 16 at the time, and the author is 17. The friend was at a party where she was drinking, smoking, and doing other stuff. The author tried to get her to call an Uber, but she refused and said she was fine to drive. Then the author saw videos on Snapchat of her driving while doing all that stuff. So, the author called her mom to report what was happening. The mom thanked them and hung up. The friend got grounded, lost her phone and car, and then punched the author later.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The friend was driving under the influence, which is illegal and dangerous. The author was worried about her safety and the potential consequences. By calling her mom, the author was trying to prevent a possible accident or harm. However, the friend felt betrayed and got into trouble with her parents, leading to their falling out.\n\nOn one hand, the author's actions were aimed at preventing a serious situation. DUI is a big deal, and if the friend had crashed, it could have been life-threatening. The MADD presentation mentioned was probably about the dangers of drunk driving, which adds context. The author might have felt a responsibility to act.\n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't go through the friend to warn her directly, but instead went straight to her mom. Some might argue that they should have tried to talk to the friend first, maybe in a more direct way, or involved authorities if necessary. However, the friend refused to listen when the author tried to get her to call an Uber. The author might not have had another option if the friend was being defiant.\n\nAlso, the friend was 16, which in many places is under the drinking age, so there's an added layer of underage drinking and driving. The author was trying to prevent illegal activities, which could have led to legal troubles for the friend and others at the party, including the author if they were part of the event.\n\nBut then, the friend and others are angry at the author for ruining their fun and getting her grounded. The author's actions led to consequences that affected the friend's life, but that's because the friend was engaging in risky behavior. The author's intent was to stop something dangerous, not just to get her in trouble.\n\nSo, considering all this, it seems like the author was trying to do the right thing to prevent harm. Even though the friend was upset and they lost their friendship, the author's action was in line with preventing a potentially tragic outcome. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
