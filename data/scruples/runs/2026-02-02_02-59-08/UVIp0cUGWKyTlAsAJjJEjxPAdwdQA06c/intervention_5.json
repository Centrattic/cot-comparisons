The party started first as a small gathering of friends drinking beer, eating pizza, watching movies. Someone posted on our grad Facebook page about this gathering and before I knew it there were like 50-60 people over smoking weed, drinking vodka and a bunch of other shit. I\u2019m not a smoker or drinker, so I left pretty quickly. My friend, who\u2019s also a grade 12 but was 16 at the time of this event, stayed. \n\nNow I\u2019m back home, reading, watching TV whatever. I\u2019m been on my phone, watching people Snapchat and Instagram\u2019s stories. In one, my friend is the focus where she\u2019s chugging a bottle of vodka, in another she\u2019s smoking a joint and in a third, she\u2019s doing shots with a guy. I know that she drove to the party so I text her to call an Uber. When she doesn\u2019t reply, I call her. She picks up and complains that Uber\u2019s too expensive so I offer to call one for her. She hangs up after saying she\u2019s fine to drive. \n\nMaybe 30 minutes later, I see on one of her friend\u2019s Snapchat story, like 5 different videos of her in the car, driving while smoking and drinking and texting on her phone and one video of them in a Macdonald\u2019s that was posted like 2 mins ago. \n\nI call my friend\u2019s mom and tell her what\u2019s happening. She says thanks and hangs up. I don\u2019t hear from her or her daughter for the rest of the night. \n\nShe\u2019s not at school the next day but I hear from from my friends and classmates that her mom and dad grounded her, taking away her phone for like 6 months and selling her car. All day, I had people, mostly her friends and other classmates who\u2019ve posted videos of themselves drinking and doing drugs, (hell one of the girls was a 16 who has a tinder account and who keeps a bottle of vodka in her locker) coming up to me and calling me a dick and an asshole and a bitch for calling her mom on her when she was just having some harmless fun. \n\nNow this was literally the same day when we had a MADD presentation at school. \n\nThe following day, she\u2019s back at school and the first thing she does when she sees me is punch me and call me a \u201cfucking life ruining asshole\u201d because on top of no phone and goodbye car, her parents aren\u2019t letting her attend any house parties and are considering not letting her go to after-prom. \n\nWas I the asshole for doing this? Because honestly, I kinda feel I am. I mean if something had happened and her car crashed and they died and I hadn\u2019t done anything, I\u2019d feel guilty for not doing anything. But now I feel guilty because I got her in trouble with her parents. And we used to be really good friends but in the last month, since she punched me, we haven\u2019t talked at all which kinda hurts. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for calling their friend's mom after the friend was driving under the influence. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author is 17, at a party where their friend (who was 16 at the time) was drinking, smoking, and then driving. The author tried to get her to call an Uber but she refused. Then the author saw her driving while doing multiple dangerous things. So they called her mom. The friend ended up getting grounded, and the author is now being criticized by others and even punched by the friend.\n\nThe main question is whether the author did the right thing. On one hand, the friend was engaging in very risky behavior\u2014driving under the influence, which could lead to a fatal accident. The author's action might have prevented a tragedy. MADD presentation at school the same day emphasizes the dangers of drunk driving, which the author might have taken to heart.\n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't know if the friend's parents were aware or if they would have handled it differently. The friend was a minor, so the parents are responsible for her actions. By informing the parents, the author could have been trying to protect the friend. However, some might argue that the author overstepped by not trying to handle it another way first, like calling the police or another authority figure.\n\nBut considering the friend was 16, under the age of legal drinking and driving, and was actively endangering herself and others, the author's intervention seems justified. The consequences from the parents, while harsh, led to the friend being grounded and her privileges taken away, which is a parent's right. The author's intent was likely to prevent harm, not just to get her in trouble. The friend's anger and physical retaliation suggest she felt betrayed, but her actions were reckless.\n\nThe community's reaction (calling the author names) might stem from peer pressure and fear of similar consequences. The author's action was a responsible choice under the circumstances. So, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
