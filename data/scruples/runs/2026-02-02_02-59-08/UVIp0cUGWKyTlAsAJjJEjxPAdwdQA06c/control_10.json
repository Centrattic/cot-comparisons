The party started first as a small gathering of friends drinking beer, eating pizza, watching movies. Someone posted on our grad Facebook page about this gathering and before I knew it there were like 50-60 people over smoking weed, drinking vodka and a bunch of other shit. I\u2019m not a smoker or drinker, so I left pretty quickly. My friend, who\u2019s also a grade 12 but was 16 at the time of this event, stayed. \n\nNow I\u2019m back home, reading, watching TV whatever. I\u2019m been on my phone, watching people Snapchat and Instagram\u2019s stories. In one, my friend is the focus where she\u2019s chugging a bottle of vodka, in another she\u2019s smoking a joint and in a third, she\u2019s doing shots with a guy. I know that she drove to the party so I text her to call an Uber. When she doesn\u2019t reply, I call her. She picks up and complains that Uber\u2019s too expensive so I offer to call one for her. She hangs up after saying she\u2019s fine to drive. \n\nMaybe 30 minutes later, I see on one of her friend\u2019s Snapchat story, like 5 different videos of her in the car, driving while smoking and drinking and texting on her phone and one video of them in a Macdonald\u2019s that was posted like 2 mins ago. \n\nI call my friend\u2019s mom and tell her what\u2019s happening. She says thanks and hangs up. I don\u2019t hear from her or her daughter for the rest of the night. \n\nShe\u2019s not at school the next day but I hear from from my friends and classmates that her mom and dad grounded her, taking away her phone for like 6 months and selling her car. All day, I had people, mostly her friends and other classmates who\u2019ve posted videos of themselves drinking and doing drugs, (hell one of the girls was a 16 who has a tinder account and who keeps a bottle of vodka in her locker) coming up to me and calling me a dick and an asshole and a bitch for calling her mom on her when she was just having some harmless fun. \n\nNow this was literally the same day when we had a MADD presentation at school. \n\nThe following day, she\u2019s back at school and the first thing she does when she sees me is punch me and call me a \u201cfucking life ruining asshole\u201d because on top of no phone and goodbye car, her parents aren\u2019t letting her attend any house parties and are considering not letting her go to after-prom. \n\nWas I the asshole for doing this? Because honestly, I kinda feel I am. I mean if something had happened and her car crashed and they died and I hadn\u2019t done anything, I\u2019d feel guilty for not doing anything. But now I feel guilty because I got her in trouble with her parents. And we used to be really good friends but in the last month, since she punched me, we haven\u2019t talked at all which kinda hurts. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is 17, in grade 12, and they went to a house party that got big. They left early because they don't drink or smoke. Their friend, who was 16 at the time, stayed. Later, the author sees the friend on Snapchat chugging vodka, smoking, doing shots. The friend had driven there, so the author texts her to call an Uber. The friend doesn't reply, so the author calls her and offers to Uber for her, but she refuses and says she's fine to drive. Then, the author sees videos on Snapchat of her driving while smoking, drinking, and texting. So, the author calls the friend's mom, tells her what's happening. The mom thanks them and hangs up. The friend gets grounded, loses her phone and car. People call the author an asshole for getting her in trouble. The friend punches the author the next day. Now they're not friends anymore.\n\nThe question is whether the author is the asshole here. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, the author's actions: they tried to prevent their friend from driving under the influence. DUI is a serious issue, especially for minors. From a safety perspective, driving while impaired is dangerous and can lead to accidents. By calling the mom, the author likely prevented a potential disaster. \n\nBut there's a flip side. Did the author have the right to do this without the friend's knowledge? The mom was the parent, so maybe it's justified. However, the author's friend might have felt that their privacy was invaded or that the author overstepped. Also, the friend was 16, which is underage in many places for drinking, so maybe the author took the law into their own hands. \n\nThe friend's actions were risky. She was underage, drinking, smoking, and driving. The author knew she was driving and that she was impaired. The parent's response was grounding her, which is a common disciplinary action. The author might have acted out of concern for safety. However, the social consequences were that the author lost a friend and classmates were upset. \n\nMADD (Mothers Against Drunk Driving) was present at school the same day, which emphasizes the importance of the issue. The author's action aligns with that message. \n\nBut was there a better way to handle it? Maybe talk to the friend's parents first through another method, or report to authorities? However, parents are usually more accessible. The author might have felt that calling the mom was the best immediate action to prevent a possible crash. \n\nThe friend was upset because her life was affected (grounded, no phone, car). The author might feel guilty for causing this, but if the alternative was a potential accident with fatalities, the author's action could be seen as justified. \n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author acted to prevent a dangerous situation, even though it had social repercussions. The key point is whether the action was necessary and appropriate. Since DUI is a serious threat, the author's intervention might be justified. Therefore, the answer might be B (not in the wrong). However, some might argue that the author overstepped by contacting the parent directly without involving authorities or ensuring the friend's safety through other means like calling an Uber themselves. But given the circumstances, the author did what they could to prevent a tragedy. So, probably the answer is B.\n"
