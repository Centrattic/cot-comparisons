The party started first as a small gathering of friends drinking beer, eating pizza, watching movies. Someone posted on our grad Facebook page about this gathering and before I knew it there were like 50-60 people over smoking weed, drinking vodka and a bunch of other shit. I\u2019m not a smoker or drinker, so I left pretty quickly. My friend, who\u2019s also a grade 12 but was 16 at the time of this event, stayed. \n\nNow I\u2019m back home, reading, watching TV whatever. I\u2019m been on my phone, watching people Snapchat and Instagram\u2019s stories. In one, my friend is the focus where she\u2019s chugging a bottle of vodka, in another she\u2019s smoking a joint and in a third, she\u2019s doing shots with a guy. I know that she drove to the party so I text her to call an Uber. When she doesn\u2019t reply, I call her. She picks up and complains that Uber\u2019s too expensive so I offer to call one for her. She hangs up after saying she\u2019s fine to drive. \n\nMaybe 30 minutes later, I see on one of her friend\u2019s Snapchat story, like 5 different videos of her in the car, driving while smoking and drinking and texting on her phone and one video of them in a Macdonald\u2019s that was posted like 2 mins ago. \n\nI call my friend\u2019s mom and tell her what\u2019s happening. She says thanks and hangs up. I don\u2019t hear from her or her daughter for the rest of the night. \n\nShe\u2019s not at school the next day but I hear from from my friends and classmates that her mom and dad grounded her, taking away her phone for like 6 months and selling her car. All day, I had people, mostly her friends and other classmates who\u2019ve posted videos of themselves drinking and doing drugs, (hell one of the girls was a 16 who has a tinder account and who keeps a bottle of vodka in her locker) coming up to me and calling me a dick and an asshole and a bitch for calling her mom on her when she was just having some harmless fun. \n\nNow this was literally the same day when we had a MADD presentation at school. \n\nThe following day, she\u2019s back at school and the first thing she does when she sees me is punch me and call me a \u201cfucking life ruining asshole\u201d because on top of no phone and goodbye car, her parents aren\u2019t letting her attend any house parties and are considering not letting her go to after-prom. \n\nWas I the asshole for doing this? Because honestly, I kinda feel I am. I mean if something had happened and her car crashed and they died and I hadn\u2019t done anything, I\u2019d feel guilty for not doing anything. But now I feel guilty because I got her in trouble with her parents. And we used to be really good friends but in the last month, since she punched me, we haven\u2019t talked at all which kinda hurts. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author called their friend's mom because the friend was driving under the influence. The friend was at a party, and the author saw her on social media doing things like drinking and driving. The author tried to get her to take an Uber, but she refused. Then, after seeing more videos, the author called her mom. The friend's parents grounded her and took away her phone and car, and now the friend is upset and even punched the author.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. Driving under the influence is a serious offense, especially for a minor. In many places, underage DUI is illegal and dangerous. The author's action was to prevent a potential accident or harm, which is a valid concern. By calling the mom, they might have prevented a tragedy.\n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't confront the friend directly but went straight to her parents. That could be seen as a breach of trust if the friend didn't want that. But considering the potential danger, maybe the author felt there was no other choice. The friend was being reckless, and the author might not have been in a position to stop her physically.\n\nThe friend's reaction is also harsh\u2014punching the author and cutting off communication. That's pretty extreme. The author's intention was to help, even if the method was direct. The friends and classmates who called the author a dick might not realize the severity of the situation. The author was trying to prevent a dangerous situation, which is a responsible action.\n\nHowever, there's a question of privacy. The author used the friend's own social media posts as evidence. But if those were public, maybe that's not an issue. Also, the author's own attendance at a party where drinking was involved might be a point, but the question is about the specific action of calling the mom.\n\nThe MADD presentation at school the same day adds context\u2014highlighting the dangers of drunk driving. The author's action aligns with the message of that presentation. If the friend had an accident, the author might have been criticized for not acting. Now, they're criticized for acting, but it's a tough call.\n\nIn terms of friendship, the author might have overstepped, but the circumstances are life-threatening. The author's intention was to prevent harm, which is a noble cause. The consequences were that the friend faced punishment, but the alternative was a potential disaster.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's action was motivated by concern for safety, even if the method was direct. The friend's punishment came from her parents, not the author, so the author isn't responsible for that. The key is whether the action was justified given the risk. I think the author is in the right here, so the answer is B.\n"
