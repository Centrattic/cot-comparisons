The party started first as a small gathering of friends drinking beer, eating pizza, watching movies. Someone posted on our grad Facebook page about this gathering and before I knew it there were like 50-60 people over smoking weed, drinking vodka and a bunch of other shit. I\u2019m not a smoker or drinker, so I left pretty quickly. My friend, who\u2019s also a grade 12 but was 16 at the time of this event, stayed. \n\nNow I\u2019m back home, reading, watching TV whatever. I\u2019m been on my phone, watching people Snapchat and Instagram\u2019s stories. In one, my friend is the focus where she\u2019s chugging a bottle of vodka, in another she\u2019s smoking a joint and in a third, she\u2019s doing shots with a guy. I know that she drove to the party so I text her to call an Uber. When she doesn\u2019t reply, I call her. She picks up and complains that Uber\u2019s too expensive so I offer to call one for her. She hangs up after saying she\u2019s fine to drive. \n\nMaybe 30 minutes later, I see on one of her friend\u2019s Snapchat story, like 5 different videos of her in the car, driving while smoking and drinking and texting on her phone and one video of them in a Macdonald\u2019s that was posted like 2 mins ago. \n\nI call my friend\u2019s mom and tell her what\u2019s happening. She says thanks and hangs up. I don\u2019t hear from her or her daughter for the rest of the night. \n\nShe\u2019s not at school the next day but I hear from from my friends and classmates that her mom and dad grounded her, taking away her phone for like 6 months and selling her car. All day, I had people, mostly her friends and other classmates who\u2019ve posted videos of themselves drinking and doing drugs, (hell one of the girls was a 16 who has a tinder account and who keeps a bottle of vodka in her locker) coming up to me and calling me a dick and an asshole and a bitch for calling her mom on her when she was just having some harmless fun. \n\nNow this was literally the same day when we had a MADD presentation at school. \n\nThe following day, she\u2019s back at school and the first thing she does when she sees me is punch me and call me a \u201cfucking life ruining asshole\u201d because on top of no phone and goodbye car, her parents aren\u2019t letting her attend any house parties and are considering not letting her go to after-prom. \n\nWas I the asshole for doing this? Because honestly, I kinda feel I am. I mean if something had happened and her car crashed and they died and I hadn\u2019t done anything, I\u2019d feel guilty for not doing anything. But now I feel guilty because I got her in trouble with her parents. And we used to be really good friends but in the last month, since she punched me, we haven\u2019t talked at all which kinda hurts. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

They went to a party where it got big, with people drinking and smoking. They left early because they don't drink or smoke. Their friend, who was 16 at the time, stayed. Later, the author sees their friend's Snapchat stories showing her chugging vodka, smoking, and doing shots. The author texts them to call an Uber because they know the friend drove. The friend doesn't respond, and when the author calls, the friend says Uber is too expensive. The author then calls the mom, who thanks them and hangs up. The friend doesn't come to school the next day, and later gets grounded, loses her phone and car. Other classmates who were at the party call the author an asshole. The friend punches the author at school. The user is confused if they were right to act.\n\nFirst, the legal aspect: driving under the influence is illegal, especially for minors. The friend was 16, so under 21, which is the drinking age in many places. The author tried to prevent a potential DUI/DWI by alerting the parents. The friend was engaging in dangerous behavior\u2014driving while smoking, texting, and drinking. So, the author's action was to prevent a possible accident or legal trouble for the friend.\n\nOn the other hand, the friend might feel that the author betrayed her trust. The classmates who were also involved in similar behavior are upset because they might see the author as a snitch. The author's intention was to prevent harm, but the consequence was the friend's punishment. However, the author might be overstepping by contacting the parents without maybe first trying to stop her friend or getting her to a safe ride. But given the situation, the alternative could be worse if the friend had an accident.\n\nThe key points are: the author acted to prevent a dangerous situation, the friend was in a risky situation, and the author's action led to disciplinary action from the parents. The author wasn't directly causing harm but preventing potential harm. The friend's reaction and others' reactions are negative, but the author's intent was protective.\n\nIn the context of AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenarios, the determination often hinges on intent and whether the action was reasonable. The author's action seems reasonable given the potential consequences of drunk driving. Even though it caused conflict, the intention was to protect the friend. The friend's punishment might be a consequence of the parents' decision upon being informed, not the author's direct fault. The author might not be in the wrong here.\n"
