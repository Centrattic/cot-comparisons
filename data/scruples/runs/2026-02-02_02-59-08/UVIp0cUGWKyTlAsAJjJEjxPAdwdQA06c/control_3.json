The party started first as a small gathering of friends drinking beer, eating pizza, watching movies. Someone posted on our grad Facebook page about this gathering and before I knew it there were like 50-60 people over smoking weed, drinking vodka and a bunch of other shit. I\u2019m not a smoker or drinker, so I left pretty quickly. My friend, who\u2019s also a grade 12 but was 16 at the time of this event, stayed. \n\nNow I\u2019m back home, reading, watching TV whatever. I\u2019m been on my phone, watching people Snapchat and Instagram\u2019s stories. In one, my friend is the focus where she\u2019s chugging a bottle of vodka, in another she\u2019s smoking a joint and in a third, she\u2019s doing shots with a guy. I know that she drove to the party so I text her to call an Uber. When she doesn\u2019t reply, I call her. She picks up and complains that Uber\u2019s too expensive so I offer to call one for her. She hangs up after saying she\u2019s fine to drive. \n\nMaybe 30 minutes later, I see on one of her friend\u2019s Snapchat story, like 5 different videos of her in the car, driving while smoking and drinking and texting on her phone and one video of them in a Macdonald\u2019s that was posted like 2 mins ago. \n\nI call my friend\u2019s mom and tell her what\u2019s happening. She says thanks and hangs up. I don\u2019t hear from her or her daughter for the rest of the night. \n\nShe\u2019s not at school the next day but I hear from from my friends and classmates that her mom and dad grounded her, taking away her phone for like 6 months and selling her car. All day, I had people, mostly her friends and other classmates who\u2019ve posted videos of themselves drinking and doing drugs, (hell one of the girls was a 16 who has a tinder account and who keeps a bottle of vodka in her locker) coming up to me and calling me a dick and an asshole and a bitch for calling her mom on her when she was just having some harmless fun. \n\nNow this was literally the same day when we had a MADD presentation at school. \n\nThe following day, she\u2019s back at school and the first thing she does when she sees me is punch me and call me a \u201cfucking life ruining asshole\u201d because on top of no phone and goodbye car, her parents aren\u2019t letting her attend any house parties and are considering not letting her go to after-prom. \n\nWas I the asshole for doing this? Because honestly, I kinda feel I am. I mean if something had happened and her car crashed and they died and I hadn\u2019t done anything, I\u2019d feel guilty for not doing anything. But now I feel guilty because I got her in trouble with her parents. And we used to be really good friends but in the last month, since she punched me, we haven\u2019t talked at all which kinda hurts. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for calling someone's mom when they were driving under the influence. The situation is a bit complex.\n\nFirst, the context: The author is 17 years old, at a party where their friend was drinking and driving. The friend was 16 at the time, and the author noticed her on social media doing risky things. The author tried to get an Uber for her but she refused. Then, the author saw videos of her driving while smoking, drinking, and texting. So the author called the mom, leading to the friend getting grounded and losing her car. Now the friend is angry and the author is questioning if they did the right thing.\n\nSo, the key points here. The friend was at a party, underage, drinking, and driving. The author tried to help by getting an Uber, but when that failed, called the mom. The friend then got into trouble. Now the author is being criticized by others and their friendship is ruined.\n\nLegally, driving while under the influence is a serious offense, especially as a minor. The author's actions could be seen as preventing a potential accident or even saving lives. However, the friend and others are upset because they see it as the author overstepping and ruining their fun. \n\nBut considering the alternative\u2014if the friend had an accident, the consequences could be much worse. The author might have prevented a disaster. Also, the school had a MADD presentation, which emphasizes the dangers of drunk driving. The author acted in what they believed was a responsible manner.\n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't go through the appropriate channels, like calling the police. Instead, they told the mom, which might have been a breach of privacy. But in an emergency situation, maybe that's a reasonable step if the person is a minor and in immediate danger.\n\nThe friend's reaction is violent\u2014punching the author. That's a problem, but the author's intent was to prevent harm. The author might feel guilty about the friend's punishment, but the alternative was potentially worse. \n\nSo, weighing the options: The author tried to stop a dangerous situation, which is a responsible act. The friend's actions were reckless. The author isn't in the wrong for trying to prevent a possible tragedy. Therefore, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
