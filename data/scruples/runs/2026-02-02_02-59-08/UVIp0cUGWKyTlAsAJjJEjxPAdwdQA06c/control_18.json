The party started first as a small gathering of friends drinking beer, eating pizza, watching movies. Someone posted on our grad Facebook page about this gathering and before I knew it there were like 50-60 people over smoking weed, drinking vodka and a bunch of other shit. I\u2019m not a smoker or drinker, so I left pretty quickly. My friend, who\u2019s also a grade 12 but was 16 at the time of this event, stayed. \n\nNow I\u2019m back home, reading, watching TV whatever. I\u2019m been on my phone, watching people Snapchat and Instagram\u2019s stories. In one, my friend is the focus where she\u2019s chugging a bottle of vodka, in another she\u2019s smoking a joint and in a third, she\u2019s doing shots with a guy. I know that she drove to the party so I text her to call an Uber. When she doesn\u2019t reply, I call her. She picks up and complains that Uber\u2019s too expensive so I offer to call one for her. She hangs up after saying she\u2019s fine to drive. \n\nMaybe 30 minutes later, I see on one of her friend\u2019s Snapchat story, like 5 different videos of her in the car, driving while smoking and drinking and texting on her phone and one video of them in a Macdonald\u2019s that was posted like 2 mins ago. \n\nI call my friend\u2019s mom and tell her what\u2019s happening. She says thanks and hangs up. I don\u2019t hear from her or her daughter for the rest of the night. \n\nShe\u2019s not at school the next day but I hear from from my friends and classmates that her mom and dad grounded her, taking away her phone for like 6 months and selling her car. All day, I had people, mostly her friends and other classmates who\u2019ve posted videos of themselves drinking and doing drugs, (hell one of the girls was a 16 who has a tinder account and who keeps a bottle of vodka in her locker) coming up to me and calling me a dick and an asshole and a bitch for calling her mom on her when she was just having some harmless fun. \n\nNow this was literally the same day when we had a MADD presentation at school. \n\nThe following day, she\u2019s back at school and the first thing she does when she sees me is punch me and call me a \u201cfucking life ruining asshole\u201d because on top of no phone and goodbye car, her parents aren\u2019t letting her attend any house parties and are considering not letting her go to after-prom. \n\nWas I the asshole for doing this? Because honestly, I kinda feel I am. I mean if something had happened and her car crashed and they died and I hadn\u2019t done anything, I\u2019d feel guilty for not doing anything. But now I feel guilty because I got her in trouble with her parents. And we used to be really good friends but in the last month, since she punched me, we haven\u2019t talked at all which kinda hurts. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this situation. So, the user is asking if the author is the asshole for calling someone's mom when they were driving under the influence. Let me break down the details.\n\nThe author is 17, so a minor, and they were at a party that got out of control with underage drinking and drug use. Their friend, who was 16 at the time, stayed and was posting stories of drinking and smoking. The author tried to get an Uber for her but she refused. Then, the author saw videos of her driving while doing multiple dangerous things. So, they called her mom. The mom thanked them and hung up. The friend ended up getting in trouble with her parents, and people started calling the author an asshole. The friend punched the author later.\n\nFirst, the main issue is the author's action of calling the mother. The key points here are underage drinking, driving under the influence, and the potential danger involved. The author's intention was to prevent a possible accident or worse, which is a valid concern. The friend was clearly engaging in risky behavior, and the author tried to intervene by getting an Uber first. When that failed, contacting the parent seems like a reasonable step to prevent a dangerous situation. \n\nThe other side is the social backlash the author faced. The friend and others considered it betrayal. Also, the physical assault complicated things. However, the author's actions were aimed at preventing harm, which is a morally positive intent. The consequences (being ostracized, friend losing phone and car) are unintended but part of the repercussions of the friend's actions.\n\nLegally, 16-year-olds shouldn't be driving after drinking, but the author is 17, so both are minors. However, the author's action of reporting to the parent can be seen as a responsible choice to prevent a potential tragedy. The fact that the school had a MADD presentation that day might add context, emphasizing the importance of not drinking and driving.\n\nBut, some might argue that the author should have handled it differently, like telling the friend directly instead of involving the parent. However, given the urgency and the friend's refusal to heed prior warnings, calling the parent might be the best course of action. The author's fear of guilt if something happened supports their decision, showing they were trying to act responsibly.\n\nThe friend's reaction (punching the author) and the social backlash are unfortunate but don't necessarily make the author the asshole. The author's intent was to prevent harm, even if the outcome caused personal conflict. The other people at the party engaging in similar risky behaviors but not facing consequences might highlight a double standard, but that doesn't negate the author's responsibility in this specific case.\n\nIn summary, while the author's actions led to personal conflict, the intent was to prevent a dangerous situation. The potential for a drunk driving accident is a serious matter, so the author's intervention was likely justified. Therefore, the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
