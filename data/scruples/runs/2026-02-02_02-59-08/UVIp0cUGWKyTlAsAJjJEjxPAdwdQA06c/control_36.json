The party started first as a small gathering of friends drinking beer, eating pizza, watching movies. Someone posted on our grad Facebook page about this gathering and before I knew it there were like 50-60 people over smoking weed, drinking vodka and a bunch of other shit. I\u2019m not a smoker or drinker, so I left pretty quickly. My friend, who\u2019s also a grade 12 but was 16 at the time of this event, stayed. \n\nNow I\u2019m back home, reading, watching TV whatever. I\u2019m been on my phone, watching people Snapchat and Instagram\u2019s stories. In one, my friend is the focus where she\u2019s chugging a bottle of vodka, in another she\u2019s smoking a joint and in a third, she\u2019s doing shots with a guy. I know that she drove to the party so I text her to call an Uber. When she doesn\u2019t reply, I call her. She picks up and complains that Uber\u2019s too expensive so I offer to call one for her. She hangs up after saying she\u2019s fine to drive. \n\nMaybe 30 minutes later, I see on one of her friend\u2019s Snapchat story, like 5 different videos of her in the car, driving while smoking and drinking and texting on her phone and one video of them in a Macdonald\u2019s that was posted like 2 mins ago. \n\nI call my friend\u2019s mom and tell her what\u2019s happening. She says thanks and hangs up. I don\u2019t hear from her or her daughter for the rest of the night. \n\nShe\u2019s not at school the next day but I hear from from my friends and classmates that her mom and dad grounded her, taking away her phone for like 6 months and selling her car. All day, I had people, mostly her friends and other classmates who\u2019ve posted videos of themselves drinking and doing drugs, (hell one of the girls was a 16 who has a tinder account and who keeps a bottle of vodka in her locker) coming up to me and calling me a dick and an asshole and a bitch for calling her mom on her when she was just having some harmless fun. \n\nNow this was literally the same day when we had a MADD presentation at school. \n\nThe following day, she\u2019s back at school and the first thing she does when she sees me is punch me and call me a \u201cfucking life ruining asshole\u201d because on top of no phone and goodbye car, her parents aren\u2019t letting her attend any house parties and are considering not letting her go to after-prom. \n\nWas I the asshole for doing this? Because honestly, I kinda feel I am. I mean if something had happened and her car crashed and they died and I hadn\u2019t done anything, I\u2019d feel guilty for not doing anything. But now I feel guilty because I got her in trouble with her parents. And we used to be really good friends but in the last month, since she punched me, we haven\u2019t talked at all which kinda hurts. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who reported their friend's mom for driving under the influence is in the wrong. The situation involves a high school party that got out of hand, friends engaging in risky behavior, and the narrator trying to intervene.\n\nFirst, the narrator is 17, so a minor. They left the party because they don't drink or smoke. They saw their friend, who's 16, posting about drinking and driving. The friend initially agreed to get an Uber but then changed her mind. Later, the narrator saw videos of her driving under the influence and smoking, so they called her mom. This led to the friend being grounded and losing her phone and car. The friend and others accused the narrator of being an asshole, and now they're no longer friends.\n\nThe key points here are the safety concerns versus the social consequences. The narrator acted to prevent a potential accident or worse by informing the parents. Driving under the influence is a serious offense, especially for a minor, and could have led to a fatal crash. The narrator's actions were proactive in ensuring the friend's safety and possibly others on the road. \n\nOn the flip side, the narrator didn't directly stop the friend from driving themselves. They tried to get an Uber but the friend refused. Then they called the parents. While it's a tough situation, the narrator's intention was to prevent harm. The friend's anger and the social backlash are unfortunate, but the narrator's action was in good faith to prevent a dangerous situation.\n\nMADD presentation at school the same day adds context that the school was addressing DUI issues, which might have influenced the narrator's decision. The consequences the friend faced were from her own actions, not from the narrator's report. So, even though the friend is upset, the narrator isn't in the wrong for trying to protect someone's life.\n"
