The party started first as a small gathering of friends drinking beer, eating pizza, watching movies. Someone posted on our grad Facebook page about this gathering and before I knew it there were like 50-60 people over smoking weed, drinking vodka and a bunch of other shit. I\u2019m not a smoker or drinker, so I left pretty quickly. My friend, who\u2019s also a grade 12 but was 16 at the time of this event, stayed. \n\nNow I\u2019m back home, reading, watching TV whatever. I\u2019m been on my phone, watching people Snapchat and Instagram\u2019s stories. In one, my friend is the focus where she\u2019s chugging a bottle of vodka, in another she\u2019s smoking a joint and in a third, she\u2019s doing shots with a guy. I know that she drove to the party so I text her to call an Uber. When she doesn\u2019t reply, I call her. She picks up and complains that Uber\u2019s too expensive so I offer to call one for her. She hangs up after saying she\u2019s fine to drive. \n\nMaybe 30 minutes later, I see on one of her friend\u2019s Snapchat story, like 5 different videos of her in the car, driving while smoking and drinking and texting on her phone and one video of them in a Macdonald\u2019s that was posted like 2 mins ago. \n\nI call my friend\u2019s mom and tell her what\u2019s happening. She says thanks and hangs up. I don\u2019t hear from her or her daughter for the rest of the night. \n\nShe\u2019s not at school the next day but I hear from from my friends and classmates that her mom and dad grounded her, taking away her phone for like 6 months and selling her car. All day, I had people, mostly her friends and other classmates who\u2019ve posted videos of themselves drinking and doing drugs, (hell one of the girls was a 16 who has a tinder account and who keeps a bottle of vodka in her locker) coming up to me and calling me a dick and an asshole and a bitch for calling her mom on her when she was just having some harmless fun. \n\nNow this was literally the same day when we had a MADD presentation at school. \n\nThe following day, she\u2019s back at school and the first thing she does when she sees me is punch me and call me a \u201cfucking life ruining asshole\u201d because on top of no phone and goodbye car, her parents aren\u2019t letting her attend any house parties and are considering not letting her go to after-prom. \n\nWas I the asshole for doing this? Because honestly, I kinda feel I am. I mean if something had happened and her car crashed and they died and I hadn\u2019t done anything, I\u2019d feel guilty for not doing anything. But now I feel guilty because I got her in trouble with her parents. And we used to be really good friends but in the last month, since she punched me, we haven\u2019t talked at all which kinda hurts. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a 17-year-old who called their friend's mom after the friend was driving under the influence. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The friend was at a party, driving after drinking and smoking, and the author tried to get her to call an Uber but failed. Then, the author called the mom, which led to the friend getting grounded and losing her phone and car. The friend and others are upset, and the author feels guilty for both the consequences and the loss of friendship.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants a second opinion. I need to evaluate if the author's actions were justified. The author was trying to prevent a potential accident or legal issue, which is a responsible action. However, the method of contacting the parent might have been seen as overstepping, especially since the friend was an adult (16 at the time, and now 17). Depending on the location's laws, 16-year-olds might have some autonomy, but in some places, 17 is still considered a minor.\n\nBut the author's intention was to prevent harm, which is a valid concern. The alternative\u2014doing nothing\u2014could lead to a dangerous situation. However, involving a parent can have serious consequences, especially if the parent isn't the best support system. The friend's reaction (punching the author) and the social backlash suggest that the peers valued the friend's freedom over safety, which is a common issue in adolescent social dynamics.\n\nSo, was the author in the wrong? On one hand, they acted to prevent a dangerous situation. On the other hand, maybe there were other ways to handle it, like confronting the friend directly or involving a responsible adult they trusted. But the author's choice was a proactive step to ensure safety. The friend's actions were reckless, and the author's intervention had consequences, but the intent was good. \n\nHowever, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. In terms of morality, the author tried to do the right thing. But in terms of social standing and friendship, they might be seen as a tattletale. The answer might depend on cultural norms and the relationship. Given that the friend was in a dangerous situation, the author's action could be justified. But the way it was handled without the friend's consent might be problematic. \n\nConsidering all that, I think the author isn't in the wrong because they prevented a potential disaster. So the answer is B (No).\n"
