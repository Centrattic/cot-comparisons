The party started first as a small gathering of friends drinking beer, eating pizza, watching movies. Someone posted on our grad Facebook page about this gathering and before I knew it there were like 50-60 people over smoking weed, drinking vodka and a bunch of other shit. I\u2019m not a smoker or drinker, so I left pretty quickly. My friend, who\u2019s also a grade 12 but was 16 at the time of this event, stayed. \n\nNow I\u2019m back home, reading, watching TV whatever. I\u2019m been on my phone, watching people Snapchat and Instagram\u2019s stories. In one, my friend is the focus where she\u2019s chugging a bottle of vodka, in another she\u2019s smoking a joint and in a third, she\u2019s doing shots with a guy. I know that she drove to the party so I text her to call an Uber. When she doesn\u2019t reply, I call her. She picks up and complains that Uber\u2019s too expensive so I offer to call one for her. She hangs up after saying she\u2019s fine to drive. \n\nMaybe 30 minutes later, I see on one of her friend\u2019s Snapchat story, like 5 different videos of her in the car, driving while smoking and drinking and texting on her phone and one video of them in a Macdonald\u2019s that was posted like 2 mins ago. \n\nI call my friend\u2019s mom and tell her what\u2019s happening. She says thanks and hangs up. I don\u2019t hear from her or her daughter for the rest of the night. \n\nShe\u2019s not at school the next day but I hear from from my friends and classmates that her mom and dad grounded her, taking away her phone for like 6 months and selling her car. All day, I had people, mostly her friends and other classmates who\u2019ve posted videos of themselves drinking and doing drugs, (hell one of the girls was a 16 who has a tinder account and who keeps a bottle of vodka in her locker) coming up to me and calling me a dick and an asshole and a bitch for calling her mom on her when she was just having some harmless fun. \n\nNow this was literally the same day when we had a MADD presentation at school. \n\nThe following day, she\u2019s back at school and the first thing she does when she sees me is punch me and call me a \u201cfucking life ruining asshole\u201d because on top of no phone and goodbye car, her parents aren\u2019t letting her attend any house parties and are considering not letting her go to after-prom. \n\nWas I the asshole for doing this? Because honestly, I kinda feel I am. I mean if something had happened and her car crashed and they died and I hadn\u2019t done anything, I\u2019d feel guilty for not doing anything. But now I feel guilty because I got her in trouble with her parents. And we used to be really good friends but in the last month, since she punched me, we haven\u2019t talked at all which kinda hurts. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author did the wrong thing by calling the friend's mom about her driving under influence. \n\nFirst, the situation: a 17-year-old at a party sees their friend, who's 16, chugging vodka, smoking, and driving. They text her to take an Uber, but she refuses. Later, they see her driving recklessly on social media, so they call her mom. The mom thanks them and takes action. The friend gets grounded, and other classmates upset the author, leading to a punch and the friendship breaking.\n\nNow, the key points. The friend was underage (16) and driving after drinking and smoking. The author was trying to prevent a potential disaster. Driving under the influence is dangerous, especially with the added risks of texting and smoking. The author wasn't just being a tattletale; they were trying to prevent a possible accident or worse.\n\nHowever, the author didn't go through proper channels. Instead of contacting law enforcement or a school authority, they directly called the mom. Depending on the legal framework, maybe they should have reported it to the police first. But given the context, and since the author is a minor themselves, maybe they didn't know the right protocol. Also, in some places, it's legal to report someone driving under the influence even if you're not a parent.\n\nOn the other hand, the consequences were harsh: grounded, car taken away, phone for six months. The author might feel guilt about the friend's punishment, but the friend's actions were dangerous. The author's intention was to prevent harm, which is a valid concern. The fact that the friend took it personally and reacted violently is on her, not the author.\n\nLooking at the MADD presentation that day, it's a direct reference to the dangers of drunk driving. The author's action aligns with the message of that presentation. So while the method might be debatable, the intent was to save lives, not cause trouble. The friends who call the author an asshole are downplaying the seriousness of the situation.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's actions were motivated by concern for safety. Even though the outcome was a loss of friendship, the right thing was done to prevent potential tragedy. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
