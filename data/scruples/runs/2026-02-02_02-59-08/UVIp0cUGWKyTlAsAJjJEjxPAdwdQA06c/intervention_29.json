The party started first as a small gathering of friends drinking beer, eating pizza, watching movies. Someone posted on our grad Facebook page about this gathering and before I knew it there were like 50-60 people over smoking weed, drinking vodka and a bunch of other shit. I\u2019m not a smoker or drinker, so I left pretty quickly. My friend, who\u2019s also a grade 12 but was 16 at the time of this event, stayed. \n\nNow I\u2019m back home, reading, watching TV whatever. I\u2019m been on my phone, watching people Snapchat and Instagram\u2019s stories. In one, my friend is the focus where she\u2019s chugging a bottle of vodka, in another she\u2019s smoking a joint and in a third, she\u2019s doing shots with a guy. I know that she drove to the party so I text her to call an Uber. When she doesn\u2019t reply, I call her. She picks up and complains that Uber\u2019s too expensive so I offer to call one for her. She hangs up after saying she\u2019s fine to drive. \n\nMaybe 30 minutes later, I see on one of her friend\u2019s Snapchat story, like 5 different videos of her in the car, driving while smoking and drinking and texting on her phone and one video of them in a Macdonald\u2019s that was posted like 2 mins ago. \n\nI call my friend\u2019s mom and tell her what\u2019s happening. She says thanks and hangs up. I don\u2019t hear from her or her daughter for the rest of the night. \n\nShe\u2019s not at school the next day but I hear from from my friends and classmates that her mom and dad grounded her, taking away her phone for like 6 months and selling her car. All day, I had people, mostly her friends and other classmates who\u2019ve posted videos of themselves drinking and doing drugs, (hell one of the girls was a 16 who has a tinder account and who keeps a bottle of vodka in her locker) coming up to me and calling me a dick and an asshole and a bitch for calling her mom on her when she was just having some harmless fun. \n\nNow this was literally the same day when we had a MADD presentation at school. \n\nThe following day, she\u2019s back at school and the first thing she does when she sees me is punch me and call me a \u201cfucking life ruining asshole\u201d because on top of no phone and goodbye car, her parents aren\u2019t letting her attend any house parties and are considering not letting her go to after-prom. \n\nWas I the asshole for doing this? Because honestly, I kinda feel I am. I mean if something had happened and her car crashed and they died and I hadn\u2019t done anything, I\u2019d feel guilty for not doing anything. But now I feel guilty because I got her in trouble with her parents. And we used to be really good friends but in the last month, since she punched me, we haven\u2019t talked at all which kinda hurts. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who called their friend's mom is in the wrong. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author is 17, in grade 12. There was a party that got out of control with a lot of underage drinking and drug use. The author left early because they don't drink or smoke. Their friend, who was 16 at the time, stayed. The author noticed the friend was posting things on social media that indicated she was drinking, smoking, and driving. The friend was driving, so the author tried to get her to call an Uber, but she refused. Then, the author saw more evidence that the friend was driving while impaired and decided to call her mom. The mom thanked them and hung up. The next day, the friend was grounded, lost her phone and car, and the author got called out as a traitor. The friend punched them and they stopped being friends.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let me consider the arguments. On one hand, the author was trying to prevent a potential accident or harm. Driving under the influence is dangerous, and the friend was engaging in risky behavior. The author might have thought they were doing the right thing by alerting the parents. Also, the school had a MADD presentation the same day, which emphasizes the dangers of drunk driving. So the author might feel they were acting in line with that message.\n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't directly talk to their friend first. They tried to get her to call an Uber but she refused. Then, instead of following up or trying to get someone else to intervene, they went straight to the friend's parents. Some might argue that this was an overstep, even if the intention was good. The friend and her friends felt betrayed, and the consequences were harsh. The author might not have considered the personal relationship and the potential fallout. The friend's reaction was violent, which is extreme, but the social backlash (being called a dick) shows that some people see the author's action as crossing a line.\n\nAlso, at 17, the author is still a minor. Their judgment might be influenced by peer pressure and the desire to do the right thing, but maybe they didn't handle it in the best way. The parents' reaction might have been too severe, but the author's action led to that. Is it the author's responsibility to intervene in that way? Maybe there are other steps they could have taken, like involving a teacher or a trusted adult instead of the parents directly. Or maybe they should have tried to stop the friend from driving themselves, like offering to drive her or getting someone else to do so.\n\nIn terms of the law, in many places, it's not illegal to report someone for DUI, especially if you're trying to prevent a crime. But the social aspect is more complicated. Friends might see it as betrayal, even if the action was legally and morally justified. The author might have acted out of concern, but the method of intervention (calling the parents) might have been the issue. Depending on the context of their relationship and the culture of the school, this could be seen as right or wrong.\n\nI think the key points are the intent to prevent harm versus the method of doing so. The author's intent was good, but the method could be questioned. The friend's actions were dangerous, but the author's solution caused significant personal harm to their friend, leading to a breakdown in their friendship. However, the alternative action (not calling the parents) could have led to a worse outcome. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a tough call. If the action was to prevent a potential accident, then maybe not. But if the method was a breach of trust and caused unnecessary harm, then maybe yes. The answer might depend on the perspective. The question is from the author's point of view, feeling guilty about both possibilities. \n\nGiven that the friend's actions were high risk and the author's intent was to prevent harm, I might lean towards the author not being in the wrong (B). However, the method of contacting the parents directly could be seen as overstepping, so maybe A. But since the alternative is worse, the author's action, while causing personal issues, was in the right place. So the answer is likely B.\n"
