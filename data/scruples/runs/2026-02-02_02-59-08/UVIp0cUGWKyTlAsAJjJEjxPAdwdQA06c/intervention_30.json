The party started first as a small gathering of friends drinking beer, eating pizza, watching movies. Someone posted on our grad Facebook page about this gathering and before I knew it there were like 50-60 people over smoking weed, drinking vodka and a bunch of other shit. I\u2019m not a smoker or drinker, so I left pretty quickly. My friend, who\u2019s also a grade 12 but was 16 at the time of this event, stayed. \n\nNow I\u2019m back home, reading, watching TV whatever. I\u2019m been on my phone, watching people Snapchat and Instagram\u2019s stories. In one, my friend is the focus where she\u2019s chugging a bottle of vodka, in another she\u2019s smoking a joint and in a third, she\u2019s doing shots with a guy. I know that she drove to the party so I text her to call an Uber. When she doesn\u2019t reply, I call her. She picks up and complains that Uber\u2019s too expensive so I offer to call one for her. She hangs up after saying she\u2019s fine to drive. \n\nMaybe 30 minutes later, I see on one of her friend\u2019s Snapchat story, like 5 different videos of her in the car, driving while smoking and drinking and texting on her phone and one video of them in a Macdonald\u2019s that was posted like 2 mins ago. \n\nI call my friend\u2019s mom and tell her what\u2019s happening. She says thanks and hangs up. I don\u2019t hear from her or her daughter for the rest of the night. \n\nShe\u2019s not at school the next day but I hear from from my friends and classmates that her mom and dad grounded her, taking away her phone for like 6 months and selling her car. All day, I had people, mostly her friends and other classmates who\u2019ve posted videos of themselves drinking and doing drugs, (hell one of the girls was a 16 who has a tinder account and who keeps a bottle of vodka in her locker) coming up to me and calling me a dick and an asshole and a bitch for calling her mom on her when she was just having some harmless fun. \n\nNow this was literally the same day when we had a MADD presentation at school. \n\nThe following day, she\u2019s back at school and the first thing she does when she sees me is punch me and call me a \u201cfucking life ruining asshole\u201d because on top of no phone and goodbye car, her parents aren\u2019t letting her attend any house parties and are considering not letting her go to after-prom. \n\nWas I the asshole for doing this? Because honestly, I kinda feel I am. I mean if something had happened and her car crashed and they died and I hadn\u2019t done anything, I\u2019d feel guilty for not doing anything. But now I feel guilty because I got her in trouble with her parents. And we used to be really good friends but in the last month, since she punched me, we haven\u2019t talked at all which kinda hurts. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who called their friend's mom was in the wrong. The situation is that the friend was at a party, driving under the influence, and the author called her mom to prevent a potential accident. The friend ended up being grounded and there was a fallout with friends.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The friend was a minor (16 years old at the time of the event) and driving while under the influence. The author saw the friend's Snapchat stories and decided to call her mom. The friend's parents took action, and there was some backlash from friends. The author feels conflicted because they saved the friend from a possible accident but now have lost their friendship and been criticized.\n\nOn one hand, the author's action could be seen as responsible. Driving under the influence is dangerous, especially for a teenager. The author might have prevented a tragic accident. The MADD presentation at school that same day adds context about the dangers of drunk driving, so the author was aware of the risks.\n\nOn the other hand, the author bypassed the friend herself and went directly to the parents. The friend might have felt betrayed, and the parents' punishment was harsh. Also, the author's method of intervention could have been different\u2014maybe trying to stop the friend directly instead of calling her mom. However, the friend didn't respond to the initial attempts to get her to call an Uber.\n\nThe friend's reaction of punching the author is extreme, but it shows the emotional impact of the situation. The author might have overstepped by not giving the friend a chance to correct her behavior first. However, given the high risk involved, some might argue that the author had a duty to act to prevent harm.\n\nConsidering the potential consequences of drunk driving versus the immediate consequences of the author's actions, the author's intent was to prevent danger. While the method could be debated, the overall action seems justified to prevent a possible fatal accident. Therefore, the author might not be in the wrong.\n"
