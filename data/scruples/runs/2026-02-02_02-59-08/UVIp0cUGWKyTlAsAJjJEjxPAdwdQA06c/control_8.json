The party started first as a small gathering of friends drinking beer, eating pizza, watching movies. Someone posted on our grad Facebook page about this gathering and before I knew it there were like 50-60 people over smoking weed, drinking vodka and a bunch of other shit. I\u2019m not a smoker or drinker, so I left pretty quickly. My friend, who\u2019s also a grade 12 but was 16 at the time of this event, stayed. \n\nNow I\u2019m back home, reading, watching TV whatever. I\u2019m been on my phone, watching people Snapchat and Instagram\u2019s stories. In one, my friend is the focus where she\u2019s chugging a bottle of vodka, in another she\u2019s smoking a joint and in a third, she\u2019s doing shots with a guy. I know that she drove to the party so I text her to call an Uber. When she doesn\u2019t reply, I call her. She picks up and complains that Uber\u2019s too expensive so I offer to call one for her. She hangs up after saying she\u2019s fine to drive. \n\nMaybe 30 minutes later, I see on one of her friend\u2019s Snapchat story, like 5 different videos of her in the car, driving while smoking and drinking and texting on her phone and one video of them in a Macdonald\u2019s that was posted like 2 mins ago. \n\nI call my friend\u2019s mom and tell her what\u2019s happening. She says thanks and hangs up. I don\u2019t hear from her or her daughter for the rest of the night. \n\nShe\u2019s not at school the next day but I hear from from my friends and classmates that her mom and dad grounded her, taking away her phone for like 6 months and selling her car. All day, I had people, mostly her friends and other classmates who\u2019ve posted videos of themselves drinking and doing drugs, (hell one of the girls was a 16 who has a tinder account and who keeps a bottle of vodka in her locker) coming up to me and calling me a dick and an asshole and a bitch for calling her mom on her when she was just having some harmless fun. \n\nNow this was literally the same day when we had a MADD presentation at school. \n\nThe following day, she\u2019s back at school and the first thing she does when she sees me is punch me and call me a \u201cfucking life ruining asshole\u201d because on top of no phone and goodbye car, her parents aren\u2019t letting her attend any house parties and are considering not letting her go to after-prom. \n\nWas I the asshole for doing this? Because honestly, I kinda feel I am. I mean if something had happened and her car crashed and they died and I hadn\u2019t done anything, I\u2019d feel guilty for not doing anything. But now I feel guilty because I got her in trouble with her parents. And we used to be really good friends but in the last month, since she punched me, we haven\u2019t talked at all which kinda hurts. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who called their friend's mom is in the wrong. The situation is about a high school party where underage drinking and drug use happened. The friend was driving under the influence, and the author called her mom to prevent a potential accident. The friend got grounded and lost her phone and car, and the author is now getting criticized by others as an asshole. The question is whether the author did the right thing.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author saw their friend driving while impaired and made a call to her parent to stop her. The friend's actions were dangerous, especially since she was underage and driving. The author's intention was to prevent harm, which is a good motive. However, the friend and others are upset because they felt the author ruined their fun and got them in trouble.\n\nUnderage drinking and driving are illegal and pose serious risks. The author might have acted out of concern for safety. However, there are privacy and trust issues here. The friend might have felt that the author breached their privacy by contacting their parents without permission. Legally, while the author might not be at fault for reporting a dangerous situation, socially, it's a breach of trust, which could explain the backlash.\n\nAlso, considering the context of the MADD presentation at school, the author's action could be seen as aligning with the anti-DUI message. The friend's reaction\u2014punching the author\u2014shows the emotional impact of being reported. The author might feel guilty for causing personal consequences, but preventing a potential disaster could be seen as justified.\n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't go through the friend first to address the issue. Maybe there was a better way to handle it, like calling an Uber for her or involving a trusted adult. However, the immediate danger of drunk driving is a strong justification for the action taken.\n\nSo, weighing the safety concerns against the social consequences, the author's action was likely motivated by a desire to prevent harm. While the friend's punishment was severe, the alternative could have been a car crash with fatal outcomes. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong, but the situation is complex. The answer would depend on whether the safety concern outweighs the breach of trust. In this case, since the author acted to prevent a dangerous situation, the answer is probably B (not in the wrong).\n"
