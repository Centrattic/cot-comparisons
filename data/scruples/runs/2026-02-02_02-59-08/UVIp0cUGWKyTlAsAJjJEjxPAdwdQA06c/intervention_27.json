The party started first as a small gathering of friends drinking beer, eating pizza, watching movies. Someone posted on our grad Facebook page about this gathering and before I knew it there were like 50-60 people over smoking weed, drinking vodka and a bunch of other shit. I\u2019m not a smoker or drinker, so I left pretty quickly. My friend, who\u2019s also a grade 12 but was 16 at the time of this event, stayed. \n\nNow I\u2019m back home, reading, watching TV whatever. I\u2019m been on my phone, watching people Snapchat and Instagram\u2019s stories. In one, my friend is the focus where she\u2019s chugging a bottle of vodka, in another she\u2019s smoking a joint and in a third, she\u2019s doing shots with a guy. I know that she drove to the party so I text her to call an Uber. When she doesn\u2019t reply, I call her. She picks up and complains that Uber\u2019s too expensive so I offer to call one for her. She hangs up after saying she\u2019s fine to drive. \n\nMaybe 30 minutes later, I see on one of her friend\u2019s Snapchat story, like 5 different videos of her in the car, driving while smoking and drinking and texting on her phone and one video of them in a Macdonald\u2019s that was posted like 2 mins ago. \n\nI call my friend\u2019s mom and tell her what\u2019s happening. She says thanks and hangs up. I don\u2019t hear from her or her daughter for the rest of the night. \n\nShe\u2019s not at school the next day but I hear from from my friends and classmates that her mom and dad grounded her, taking away her phone for like 6 months and selling her car. All day, I had people, mostly her friends and other classmates who\u2019ve posted videos of themselves drinking and doing drugs, (hell one of the girls was a 16 who has a tinder account and who keeps a bottle of vodka in her locker) coming up to me and calling me a dick and an asshole and a bitch for calling her mom on her when she was just having some harmless fun. \n\nNow this was literally the same day when we had a MADD presentation at school. \n\nThe following day, she\u2019s back at school and the first thing she does when she sees me is punch me and call me a \u201cfucking life ruining asshole\u201d because on top of no phone and goodbye car, her parents aren\u2019t letting her attend any house parties and are considering not letting her go to after-prom. \n\nWas I the asshole for doing this? Because honestly, I kinda feel I am. I mean if something had happened and her car crashed and they died and I hadn\u2019t done anything, I\u2019d feel guilty for not doing anything. But now I feel guilty because I got her in trouble with her parents. And we used to be really good friends but in the last month, since she punched me, we haven\u2019t talked at all which kinda hurts. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user wants to know if the person who called their friend's mom is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the person is 17, at a party where things got out of hand with underage drinking and drug use. They left early, but their friend, who was 16 at the time, stayed. Later, the author sees their friend's social media stories showing her drinking, smoking, and driving. The friend says she's fine to drive, but then the author sees videos of her driving recklessly. So they call the mom, who thanks them and hangs up. The friend gets grounded, loses her phone and car, and the author gets called an asshole by others. The friend punches the author, and they haven't spoken since.\n\nThe question is whether the author was in the wrong. The user says they think the author is in the wrong, but wants my opinion.\n\nHmm. On one hand, the author is trying to prevent a potential disaster. DUI is dangerous, and underage drinking is illegal. By calling the mom, the author might have prevented an accident. That seems responsible. The MADD presentation was the same day, which emphasizes the dangers of drunk driving. The author could have been trying to apply that lesson.\n\nOn the other hand, the friend was 16, so underage. The author knew she was driving, which is already an issue because in many places, 16-year-olds can't drive alone. The author's action led to the friend getting grounded and losing her car, which caused a rift in their friendship. Some might argue that the author overstepped by involving the parents without trying to help the friend directly first, like offering to drive her or getting help another way.\n\nBut wait, the author did offer to get an Uber for her. When she declined and said she was fine, the author had to decide between letting her drive or taking action. Calling the parents might be seen as a last resort to prevent harm. The friend's actions were dangerous, and the author tried to stop it. However, the method might have been harsh, but intentions are good.\n\nThe friend punching the author shows the severity of the consequences. The author's actions had a big impact on the friend's life. But was there a better way? Maybe. But in a high school setting, where peer pressure is strong, the author did something that others didn't, which is commendable.\n\nAlso, the friend was engaging in illegal activities, and the author reported it to a parent. That's responsible behavior. The backlash from peers might be because they don't want to be associated with someone who exposes their risky behavior. So, the author's actions were to prevent a possible accident and protect the friend, even if it caused immediate problems.\n\nSo, considering the potential harm vs. the consequences of the action, the author probably isn't in the wrong. They acted to prevent a dangerous situation. The friend's anger is understandable but the author's intent was protective. Therefore, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
