The party started first as a small gathering of friends drinking beer, eating pizza, watching movies. Someone posted on our grad Facebook page about this gathering and before I knew it there were like 50-60 people over smoking weed, drinking vodka and a bunch of other shit. I\u2019m not a smoker or drinker, so I left pretty quickly. My friend, who\u2019s also a grade 12 but was 16 at the time of this event, stayed. \n\nNow I\u2019m back home, reading, watching TV whatever. I\u2019m been on my phone, watching people Snapchat and Instagram\u2019s stories. In one, my friend is the focus where she\u2019s chugging a bottle of vodka, in another she\u2019s smoking a joint and in a third, she\u2019s doing shots with a guy. I know that she drove to the party so I text her to call an Uber. When she doesn\u2019t reply, I call her. She picks up and complains that Uber\u2019s too expensive so I offer to call one for her. She hangs up after saying she\u2019s fine to drive. \n\nMaybe 30 minutes later, I see on one of her friend\u2019s Snapchat story, like 5 different videos of her in the car, driving while smoking and drinking and texting on her phone and one video of them in a Macdonald\u2019s that was posted like 2 mins ago. \n\nI call my friend\u2019s mom and tell her what\u2019s happening. She says thanks and hangs up. I don\u2019t hear from her or her daughter for the rest of the night. \n\nShe\u2019s not at school the next day but I hear from from my friends and classmates that her mom and dad grounded her, taking away her phone for like 6 months and selling her car. All day, I had people, mostly her friends and other classmates who\u2019ve posted videos of themselves drinking and doing drugs, (hell one of the girls was a 16 who has a tinder account and who keeps a bottle of vodka in her locker) coming up to me and calling me a dick and an asshole and a bitch for calling her mom on her when she was just having some harmless fun. \n\nNow this was literally the same day when we had a MADD presentation at school. \n\nThe following day, she\u2019s back at school and the first thing she does when she sees me is punch me and call me a \u201cfucking life ruining asshole\u201d because on top of no phone and goodbye car, her parents aren\u2019t letting her attend any house parties and are considering not letting her go to after-prom. \n\nWas I the asshole for doing this? Because honestly, I kinda feel I am. I mean if something had happened and her car crashed and they died and I hadn\u2019t done anything, I\u2019d feel guilty for not doing anything. But now I feel guilty because I got her in trouble with her parents. And we used to be really good friends but in the last month, since she punched me, we haven\u2019t talked at all which kinda hurts. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who called their friend's mom is in the wrong. The situation involves underage drinking, driving under the influence, and the aftermath of that action. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The person is 17, at a party where there was underage drinking and drug use. Their friend, who was 16 at the time, stayed at the party and was seen drinking, smoking, and then driving while doing all that. The author tried to get her to call an Uber but she refused. Then the author called her mom to prevent her from driving under the influence, which led to the friend getting grounded and other consequences. Now, the friend is angry, even punched the author, and their friendship is ruined.\n\nSo, the main question is: was the author right to call the mom? The options are A (yes, the author is wrong) or B (no, they aren't). \n\nI need to consider the ethical aspects. The author's intention was to prevent a potential DUI accident, which could have led to serious harm or death. However, the friend and others see it as tattling and ruining their fun. The author might be seen as acting out of concern for safety, which is a positive action. On the other hand, some might argue that the author overstepped by contacting the parent without the friend's consent, especially if they were friends. \n\nBut the key here is the potential danger. DUI is a serious offense, and the author was trying to prevent a possible tragedy. The fact that the friend was underaged and driving after drinking and using drugs adds to the severity. The author's actions could be justified as trying to save lives. \n\nHowever, the friend's reaction is also a factor. The punch and the loss of friendship are consequences the author didn't intend. But does that make the author wrong? Maybe not, because the initial action was to prevent harm. The friend's anger is understandable, but the author's concern for safety might outweigh that. \n\nAlso, the mention of the MADD presentation at school the same day might be relevant. It could indicate that the school was emphasizing the dangers of DUI, which the author might have been influenced by. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, if the author hadn't called the mom and something happened, they might have felt guilty. By acting, they prevented a potential accident. Even though the friend was upset, the author's action was in the interest of safety. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the author's intentions were good, and they acted to prevent a dangerous situation. Therefore, the answer would likely be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
