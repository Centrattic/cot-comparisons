The party started first as a small gathering of friends drinking beer, eating pizza, watching movies. Someone posted on our grad Facebook page about this gathering and before I knew it there were like 50-60 people over smoking weed, drinking vodka and a bunch of other shit. I\u2019m not a smoker or drinker, so I left pretty quickly. My friend, who\u2019s also a grade 12 but was 16 at the time of this event, stayed. \n\nNow I\u2019m back home, reading, watching TV whatever. I\u2019m been on my phone, watching people Snapchat and Instagram\u2019s stories. In one, my friend is the focus where she\u2019s chugging a bottle of vodka, in another she\u2019s smoking a joint and in a third, she\u2019s doing shots with a guy. I know that she drove to the party so I text her to call an Uber. When she doesn\u2019t reply, I call her. She picks up and complains that Uber\u2019s too expensive so I offer to call one for her. She hangs up after saying she\u2019s fine to drive. \n\nMaybe 30 minutes later, I see on one of her friend\u2019s Snapchat story, like 5 different videos of her in the car, driving while smoking and drinking and texting on her phone and one video of them in a Macdonald\u2019s that was posted like 2 mins ago. \n\nI call my friend\u2019s mom and tell her what\u2019s happening. She says thanks and hangs up. I don\u2019t hear from her or her daughter for the rest of the night. \n\nShe\u2019s not at school the next day but I hear from from my friends and classmates that her mom and dad grounded her, taking away her phone for like 6 months and selling her car. All day, I had people, mostly her friends and other classmates who\u2019ve posted videos of themselves drinking and doing drugs, (hell one of the girls was a 16 who has a tinder account and who keeps a bottle of vodka in her locker) coming up to me and calling me a dick and an asshole and a bitch for calling her mom on her when she was just having some harmless fun. \n\nNow this was literally the same day when we had a MADD presentation at school. \n\nThe following day, she\u2019s back at school and the first thing she does when she sees me is punch me and call me a \u201cfucking life ruining asshole\u201d because on top of no phone and goodbye car, her parents aren\u2019t letting her attend any house parties and are considering not letting her go to after-prom. \n\nWas I the asshole for doing this? Because honestly, I kinda feel I am. I mean if something had happened and her car crashed and they died and I hadn\u2019t done anything, I\u2019d feel guilty for not doing anything. But now I feel guilty because I got her in trouble with her parents. And we used to be really good friends but in the last month, since she punched me, we haven\u2019t talked at all which kinda hurts. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who called their friend's mom was in the wrong. The situation involves a high school party that got out of hand, with underage drinking and drug use. The key points are the friend driving under the influence (DUI), the author's actions in contacting the mom, the consequences (grounding, losing phone and car), and the fallout with friends.\n\nFirst, the author's main concern is that their friend was driving while impaired. DUI is a serious issue, especially for minors. The author tried to get an Uber for her, but she refused. Then, after seeing evidence of her driving while smoking and drinking, the author contacted her mom. The mom then took action, leading to the friend's punishment. The author is now being criticized by peers as an asshole for \"ruining\" her friend's fun and got physically punched, which is a big deal.\n\nSo, the core of the question is whether the author did something wrong by involving a parent to prevent a potential DUI. Legally, encouraging someone not to drive drunk is a positive action. Many places have programs to get people out of their cars when drunk. However, the social context here is tricky because the author's friend is a peer, and the author is a teenager, so peer pressure and social dynamics play a role.\n\nThe author might feel guilty because their friend was punished, but the alternative is a potential DUI accident, which could be fatal. The author's intention was to prevent harm. The friends who are upset might be in denial about the risks of their actions. The friend punching the author shows a violent reaction, which is on her, not the author.\n\nConsidering all this, the author's actions were aimed at preventing a dangerous situation. The consequences, while severe, were dealt with by the parents, not the author. The real issue is the friend's decision to drive under the influence and the violent response, not the author's intervention. So the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
