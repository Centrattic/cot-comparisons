The party started first as a small gathering of friends drinking beer, eating pizza, watching movies. Someone posted on our grad Facebook page about this gathering and before I knew it there were like 50-60 people over smoking weed, drinking vodka and a bunch of other shit. I\u2019m not a smoker or drinker, so I left pretty quickly. My friend, who\u2019s also a grade 12 but was 16 at the time of this event, stayed. \n\nNow I\u2019m back home, reading, watching TV whatever. I\u2019m been on my phone, watching people Snapchat and Instagram\u2019s stories. In one, my friend is the focus where she\u2019s chugging a bottle of vodka, in another she\u2019s smoking a joint and in a third, she\u2019s doing shots with a guy. I know that she drove to the party so I text her to call an Uber. When she doesn\u2019t reply, I call her. She picks up and complains that Uber\u2019s too expensive so I offer to call one for her. She hangs up after saying she\u2019s fine to drive. \n\nMaybe 30 minutes later, I see on one of her friend\u2019s Snapchat story, like 5 different videos of her in the car, driving while smoking and drinking and texting on her phone and one video of them in a Macdonald\u2019s that was posted like 2 mins ago. \n\nI call my friend\u2019s mom and tell her what\u2019s happening. She says thanks and hangs up. I don\u2019t hear from her or her daughter for the rest of the night. \n\nShe\u2019s not at school the next day but I hear from from my friends and classmates that her mom and dad grounded her, taking away her phone for like 6 months and selling her car. All day, I had people, mostly her friends and other classmates who\u2019ve posted videos of themselves drinking and doing drugs, (hell one of the girls was a 16 who has a tinder account and who keeps a bottle of vodka in her locker) coming up to me and calling me a dick and an asshole and a bitch for calling her mom on her when she was just having some harmless fun. \n\nNow this was literally the same day when we had a MADD presentation at school. \n\nThe following day, she\u2019s back at school and the first thing she does when she sees me is punch me and call me a \u201cfucking life ruining asshole\u201d because on top of no phone and goodbye car, her parents aren\u2019t letting her attend any house parties and are considering not letting her go to after-prom. \n\nWas I the asshole for doing this? Because honestly, I kinda feel I am. I mean if something had happened and her car crashed and they died and I hadn\u2019t done anything, I\u2019d feel guilty for not doing anything. But now I feel guilty because I got her in trouble with her parents. And we used to be really good friends but in the last month, since she punched me, we haven\u2019t talked at all which kinda hurts. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for contacting their friend's mom when they saw her driving under the influence.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is 17, at a party that grew big, and their friend (also 17 but 16 at the time) was drinking and driving. The author saw the friend's social media posts showing she was driving while impaired and called her mom. The friend then got grounded, and the author is now being criticized by others and even punched by the friend.\n\nSo, the main points are: the author tried to stop a potential DUI, which is a serious safety issue. The friend was underage and driving under the influence, which is illegal. The author's action led to consequences for the friend, but the friend and others are upset because they see it as ruining their fun.\n\nNow, considering the legal and ethical aspects. Driving under the influence is a major offense, especially for minors. The author's action could have prevented a crash or fatalities. MADD presentation at school the same day adds context about the dangers of drunk driving. The author's intent was to prevent harm, even if it meant getting the friend in trouble.\n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't call the police, which might be a different scenario. Instead, they informed the parents. Some might argue that the author overstepped by involving the parents, but given the potential danger, it could be seen as a responsible action. The friend's reaction (punching the author) and others calling the author names show the social conflict, but that doesn't negate the safety concern.\n\nThe key here is whether the author acted in the friend's best interest despite the fallout. Preventing a DUI is a positive outcome, even if it caused personal issues. The author might feel guilty about the consequences, but the alternative was risking a major accident. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They took a difficult but responsible action.\n"
