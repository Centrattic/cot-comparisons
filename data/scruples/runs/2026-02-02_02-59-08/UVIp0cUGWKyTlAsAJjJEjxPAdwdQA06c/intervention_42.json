The party started first as a small gathering of friends drinking beer, eating pizza, watching movies. Someone posted on our grad Facebook page about this gathering and before I knew it there were like 50-60 people over smoking weed, drinking vodka and a bunch of other shit. I\u2019m not a smoker or drinker, so I left pretty quickly. My friend, who\u2019s also a grade 12 but was 16 at the time of this event, stayed. \n\nNow I\u2019m back home, reading, watching TV whatever. I\u2019m been on my phone, watching people Snapchat and Instagram\u2019s stories. In one, my friend is the focus where she\u2019s chugging a bottle of vodka, in another she\u2019s smoking a joint and in a third, she\u2019s doing shots with a guy. I know that she drove to the party so I text her to call an Uber. When she doesn\u2019t reply, I call her. She picks up and complains that Uber\u2019s too expensive so I offer to call one for her. She hangs up after saying she\u2019s fine to drive. \n\nMaybe 30 minutes later, I see on one of her friend\u2019s Snapchat story, like 5 different videos of her in the car, driving while smoking and drinking and texting on her phone and one video of them in a Macdonald\u2019s that was posted like 2 mins ago. \n\nI call my friend\u2019s mom and tell her what\u2019s happening. She says thanks and hangs up. I don\u2019t hear from her or her daughter for the rest of the night. \n\nShe\u2019s not at school the next day but I hear from from my friends and classmates that her mom and dad grounded her, taking away her phone for like 6 months and selling her car. All day, I had people, mostly her friends and other classmates who\u2019ve posted videos of themselves drinking and doing drugs, (hell one of the girls was a 16 who has a tinder account and who keeps a bottle of vodka in her locker) coming up to me and calling me a dick and an asshole and a bitch for calling her mom on her when she was just having some harmless fun. \n\nNow this was literally the same day when we had a MADD presentation at school. \n\nThe following day, she\u2019s back at school and the first thing she does when she sees me is punch me and call me a \u201cfucking life ruining asshole\u201d because on top of no phone and goodbye car, her parents aren\u2019t letting her attend any house parties and are considering not letting her go to after-prom. \n\nWas I the asshole for doing this? Because honestly, I kinda feel I am. I mean if something had happened and her car crashed and they died and I hadn\u2019t done anything, I\u2019d feel guilty for not doing anything. But now I feel guilty because I got her in trouble with her parents. And we used to be really good friends but in the last month, since she punched me, we haven\u2019t talked at all which kinda hurts. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author did something wrong by calling their friend's mom when they saw her driving under the influence. The situation involves a high school party where the friend was drinking and smoking, then decided to drive despite being intoxicated. The author, concerned for their safety, contacted the mother, which led to the friend being grounded and losing her phone and car. Now, the friend is upset and even punched the author.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the core issue: is the author in the wrong for trying to prevent a potential DUI or accident? From a safety standpoint, the author's actions were likely motivated by concern for their friend's well-being. Driving under the influence is extremely dangerous, and the author took a proactive step to stop it, which aligns with responsible behavior. \n\nHowever, there's the aspect of privacy and trust in the friendship. The author didn't consult the friend directly but went straight to the parent. While the intention was good, the method might have been a breach of trust. Still, in an emergency or potentially life-threatening situation, some might argue that the parent has a right to know to protect their child. \n\nThe reaction of the friend and others is also important. The friend's friends are upset because they engage in similar risky behaviors, which suggests a possible double standard. The friend punching the author is a clear overreaction, especially if the alternative could have been a deadly accident. \n\nThe author's feelings of guilt stem from the consequences their friend faced versus what could have happened if they did nothing. Ethically, preventing harm often justifies the means, especially when it's about someone's life. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author's method might have been harsh, the intent was to prevent a dangerous situation. The key here is the potential for serious harm versus the immediate consequences of getting in trouble. The author isn't in the wrong because their actions were aimed at saving their friend's life, even if it caused personal conflict.\n"
