The party started first as a small gathering of friends drinking beer, eating pizza, watching movies. Someone posted on our grad Facebook page about this gathering and before I knew it there were like 50-60 people over smoking weed, drinking vodka and a bunch of other shit. I\u2019m not a smoker or drinker, so I left pretty quickly. My friend, who\u2019s also a grade 12 but was 16 at the time of this event, stayed. \n\nNow I\u2019m back home, reading, watching TV whatever. I\u2019m been on my phone, watching people Snapchat and Instagram\u2019s stories. In one, my friend is the focus where she\u2019s chugging a bottle of vodka, in another she\u2019s smoking a joint and in a third, she\u2019s doing shots with a guy. I know that she drove to the party so I text her to call an Uber. When she doesn\u2019t reply, I call her. She picks up and complains that Uber\u2019s too expensive so I offer to call one for her. She hangs up after saying she\u2019s fine to drive. \n\nMaybe 30 minutes later, I see on one of her friend\u2019s Snapchat story, like 5 different videos of her in the car, driving while smoking and drinking and texting on her phone and one video of them in a Macdonald\u2019s that was posted like 2 mins ago. \n\nI call my friend\u2019s mom and tell her what\u2019s happening. She says thanks and hangs up. I don\u2019t hear from her or her daughter for the rest of the night. \n\nShe\u2019s not at school the next day but I hear from from my friends and classmates that her mom and dad grounded her, taking away her phone for like 6 months and selling her car. All day, I had people, mostly her friends and other classmates who\u2019ve posted videos of themselves drinking and doing drugs, (hell one of the girls was a 16 who has a tinder account and who keeps a bottle of vodka in her locker) coming up to me and calling me a dick and an asshole and a bitch for calling her mom on her when she was just having some harmless fun. \n\nNow this was literally the same day when we had a MADD presentation at school. \n\nThe following day, she\u2019s back at school and the first thing she does when she sees me is punch me and call me a \u201cfucking life ruining asshole\u201d because on top of no phone and goodbye car, her parents aren\u2019t letting her attend any house parties and are considering not letting her go to after-prom. \n\nWas I the asshole for doing this? Because honestly, I kinda feel I am. I mean if something had happened and her car crashed and they died and I hadn\u2019t done anything, I\u2019d feel guilty for not doing anything. But now I feel guilty because I got her in trouble with her parents. And we used to be really good friends but in the last month, since she punched me, we haven\u2019t talked at all which kinda hurts. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author's friend was driving under the influence after a party. The author saw social media posts showing the friend driving while smoking, drinking, and texting. The friend had initially refused to call an Uber because it was too expensive. The author then called the friend's mom to report this dangerous behavior. Now, the friend is grounded, her parents sold her car, and she's upset. Other friends are mad at the author, and the friend even punched him. The author is conflicted because they feel they did the right thing to prevent a possible accident but also feel guilty for getting her in trouble with her parents and losing a friend.\n\nFirst, the key points here are the safety concern versus personal boundaries. The author acted to prevent a potential DUI accident, which could have serious consequences. The friend was driving while impaired by alcohol, drugs, and distracted by texting. That's a dangerous combination. The author took action because they saw social media evidence, which might not be the most direct evidence, but it's still valid in this context. \n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't confront the friend directly when they were about to drive but instead alerted the parents. This might be seen as an overstep if the author didn't give the friend a chance to make a better decision themselves. However, the friend had already refused the Uber offer, so maybe the author felt it was necessary to involve the parents to ensure safety.\n\nThe friend's reaction, punching the author, is clearly inappropriate, but that doesn't make the author wrong. The author's intention was to prevent harm. The friends calling the author an asshole might be due to their own risky behavior being exposed. \n\nThe author also mentions a MADD presentation happening the same day, which emphasizes the importance of not drinking and driving. This context suggests that the school and community are aware of the risks, so the author's action aligns with the educational message they received. \n\nHowever, the author could have considered other steps first, like calling an Uber themselves if the friend refused or contacting a parent through another method. But in a high school setting, calling the parents directly when someone is in immediate danger seems justified. \n\nIn terms of the author's responsibility, the potential harm of letting the friend drive (accident, injury, death) is much more severe than the consequences of getting her grounded. The author's intent was to prevent a greater harm, which is a valid reason. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's actions were done with the intention of preventing a dangerous situation. While the method might be debatable, the intent was protective. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong. The answer is B.\n"
