The party started first as a small gathering of friends drinking beer, eating pizza, watching movies. Someone posted on our grad Facebook page about this gathering and before I knew it there were like 50-60 people over smoking weed, drinking vodka and a bunch of other shit. I\u2019m not a smoker or drinker, so I left pretty quickly. My friend, who\u2019s also a grade 12 but was 16 at the time of this event, stayed. \n\nNow I\u2019m back home, reading, watching TV whatever. I\u2019m been on my phone, watching people Snapchat and Instagram\u2019s stories. In one, my friend is the focus where she\u2019s chugging a bottle of vodka, in another she\u2019s smoking a joint and in a third, she\u2019s doing shots with a guy. I know that she drove to the party so I text her to call an Uber. When she doesn\u2019t reply, I call her. She picks up and complains that Uber\u2019s too expensive so I offer to call one for her. She hangs up after saying she\u2019s fine to drive. \n\nMaybe 30 minutes later, I see on one of her friend\u2019s Snapchat story, like 5 different videos of her in the car, driving while smoking and drinking and texting on her phone and one video of them in a Macdonald\u2019s that was posted like 2 mins ago. \n\nI call my friend\u2019s mom and tell her what\u2019s happening. She says thanks and hangs up. I don\u2019t hear from her or her daughter for the rest of the night. \n\nShe\u2019s not at school the next day but I hear from from my friends and classmates that her mom and dad grounded her, taking away her phone for like 6 months and selling her car. All day, I had people, mostly her friends and other classmates who\u2019ve posted videos of themselves drinking and doing drugs, (hell one of the girls was a 16 who has a tinder account and who keeps a bottle of vodka in her locker) coming up to me and calling me a dick and an asshole and a bitch for calling her mom on her when she was just having some harmless fun. \n\nNow this was literally the same day when we had a MADD presentation at school. \n\nThe following day, she\u2019s back at school and the first thing she does when she sees me is punch me and call me a \u201cfucking life ruining asshole\u201d because on top of no phone and goodbye car, her parents aren\u2019t letting her attend any house parties and are considering not letting her go to after-prom. \n\nWas I the asshole for doing this? Because honestly, I kinda feel I am. I mean if something had happened and her car crashed and they died and I hadn\u2019t done anything, I\u2019d feel guilty for not doing anything. But now I feel guilty because I got her in trouble with her parents. And we used to be really good friends but in the last month, since she punched me, we haven\u2019t talked at all which kinda hurts. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author called their friend's mom because they saw her driving under the influence. The friend was at a party, doing drugs and drinking, and then decided to drive. The author tried to get her to call an Uber but she refused, then saw her driving while doing all those things, so called her parents. The result was that the friend got grounded and her car was sold. Now the friend is upset and even punched the author. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. Driving under the influence is a serious offense and can lead to accidents, injuries, or death. The friend was not only drinking but also smoking and texting while driving. The author's action was to prevent a potential disaster. Legally, the author is acting in a way that could prevent a DUI, which is a good thing.\n\nBut then there's the social aspect. The friend and other classmates are upset, calling the author names. They feel it was their \"harmless fun\" being ruined. The author's friend's parents took disciplinary action, but the friend is now angry. The author is questioning if they were right to intervene. The key here is the balance between safety and the social fallout.\n\nAnother angle: the author is a minor (17 years old) and the friend was 16 at the time. Both are underage, which complicates things. The party had a lot of underage drinking and drug use. The author tried to do the right thing by contacting the parents, which is a responsible action given the risks involved. However, the friend's reaction and the social consequences (losing friends, punches) are significant.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that there was a MADD (Mothers Against Drunk Driving) presentation at school that same day. This might have reinforced the importance of preventing drunk driving. The author's action aligns with the message of MADD, which is to prevent such incidents. So, from a moral standpoint, the author is trying to prevent harm, which is commendable.\n\nBut the author is feeling guilty because of the friend's punishment and the loss of the friendship. However, the author's responsibility is more about preventing a dangerous situation. Even though the friend is upset, the author's action was to prevent a potential tragedy. \n\nThe counterargument could be that the author overstepped by calling the parents without being asked. However, given the severity of the situation (a friend potentially driving drunk), it's a responsible action. The author couldn't have known how the parents would react, but the intent was good.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's action was to prevent a dangerous situation, which is the right thing to do. The friend's punishment was a result of her own actions, and the author's intervention likely saved her from a much worse consequence. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
