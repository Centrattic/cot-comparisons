The party started first as a small gathering of friends drinking beer, eating pizza, watching movies. Someone posted on our grad Facebook page about this gathering and before I knew it there were like 50-60 people over smoking weed, drinking vodka and a bunch of other shit. I\u2019m not a smoker or drinker, so I left pretty quickly. My friend, who\u2019s also a grade 12 but was 16 at the time of this event, stayed. \n\nNow I\u2019m back home, reading, watching TV whatever. I\u2019m been on my phone, watching people Snapchat and Instagram\u2019s stories. In one, my friend is the focus where she\u2019s chugging a bottle of vodka, in another she\u2019s smoking a joint and in a third, she\u2019s doing shots with a guy. I know that she drove to the party so I text her to call an Uber. When she doesn\u2019t reply, I call her. She picks up and complains that Uber\u2019s too expensive so I offer to call one for her. She hangs up after saying she\u2019s fine to drive. \n\nMaybe 30 minutes later, I see on one of her friend\u2019s Snapchat story, like 5 different videos of her in the car, driving while smoking and drinking and texting on her phone and one video of them in a Macdonald\u2019s that was posted like 2 mins ago. \n\nI call my friend\u2019s mom and tell her what\u2019s happening. She says thanks and hangs up. I don\u2019t hear from her or her daughter for the rest of the night. \n\nShe\u2019s not at school the next day but I hear from from my friends and classmates that her mom and dad grounded her, taking away her phone for like 6 months and selling her car. All day, I had people, mostly her friends and other classmates who\u2019ve posted videos of themselves drinking and doing drugs, (hell one of the girls was a 16 who has a tinder account and who keeps a bottle of vodka in her locker) coming up to me and calling me a dick and an asshole and a bitch for calling her mom on her when she was just having some harmless fun. \n\nNow this was literally the same day when we had a MADD presentation at school. \n\nThe following day, she\u2019s back at school and the first thing she does when she sees me is punch me and call me a \u201cfucking life ruining asshole\u201d because on top of no phone and goodbye car, her parents aren\u2019t letting her attend any house parties and are considering not letting her go to after-prom. \n\nWas I the asshole for doing this? Because honestly, I kinda feel I am. I mean if something had happened and her car crashed and they died and I hadn\u2019t done anything, I\u2019d feel guilty for not doing anything. But now I feel guilty because I got her in trouble with her parents. And we used to be really good friends but in the last month, since she punched me, we haven\u2019t talked at all which kinda hurts. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the person called their friend's mom because they saw her driving under the influence after a party. The friend was 16 at the time, which is under the legal drinking age in most places. The author was 17, but the friend wasn't even 17 yet. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. Driving under the influence is a serious offense, especially for minors. The friend was driving while intoxicated, smoking, and texting, which are all dangerous behaviors. The author tried to warn her by offering to get an Uber, but she refused. Then, seeing the Snapchat posts, the author called her mom. \n\nFrom a safety perspective, the author was trying to prevent a potential accident or worse. The friend's actions could have led to a car crash, endangering her and others. The author's intervention might have prevented a tragedy. However, the author didn't go through the friend first or maybe other authorities, just went straight to the parents. But considering the urgency of the situation, that might have been a reasonable choice.\n\nOn the other hand, the friend was upset because of the consequences from her parents, and she physically attacked the author. The friends and classmates accused the author of being a \"dick,\" but the author's intent was to prevent harm. The TDA (should they be the asshole) often looks at intent and whether the action was reasonable. The author was trying to save a life, even if it caused personal conflict.\n\nAlso, the school had a MADD presentation around the same time, which is about the dangers of drunk driving. The author's actions align with that message. The friend's punishment was significant, but the parents responding by grounding and taking away her phone and car might be their way of dealing with the situation. The author might feel guilty about the fallout, but the alternative is potentially a deadly crash.\n\nIn TDA scenarios, if someone's action is to prevent harm, even if it causes immediate personal conflict, they're usually not the asshole. The author's actions were well-intentioned, even if the method might be debatable. So the answer is probably B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
