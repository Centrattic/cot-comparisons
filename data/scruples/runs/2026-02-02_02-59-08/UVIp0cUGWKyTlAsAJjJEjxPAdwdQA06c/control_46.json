The party started first as a small gathering of friends drinking beer, eating pizza, watching movies. Someone posted on our grad Facebook page about this gathering and before I knew it there were like 50-60 people over smoking weed, drinking vodka and a bunch of other shit. I\u2019m not a smoker or drinker, so I left pretty quickly. My friend, who\u2019s also a grade 12 but was 16 at the time of this event, stayed. \n\nNow I\u2019m back home, reading, watching TV whatever. I\u2019m been on my phone, watching people Snapchat and Instagram\u2019s stories. In one, my friend is the focus where she\u2019s chugging a bottle of vodka, in another she\u2019s smoking a joint and in a third, she\u2019s doing shots with a guy. I know that she drove to the party so I text her to call an Uber. When she doesn\u2019t reply, I call her. She picks up and complains that Uber\u2019s too expensive so I offer to call one for her. She hangs up after saying she\u2019s fine to drive. \n\nMaybe 30 minutes later, I see on one of her friend\u2019s Snapchat story, like 5 different videos of her in the car, driving while smoking and drinking and texting on her phone and one video of them in a Macdonald\u2019s that was posted like 2 mins ago. \n\nI call my friend\u2019s mom and tell her what\u2019s happening. She says thanks and hangs up. I don\u2019t hear from her or her daughter for the rest of the night. \n\nShe\u2019s not at school the next day but I hear from from my friends and classmates that her mom and dad grounded her, taking away her phone for like 6 months and selling her car. All day, I had people, mostly her friends and other classmates who\u2019ve posted videos of themselves drinking and doing drugs, (hell one of the girls was a 16 who has a tinder account and who keeps a bottle of vodka in her locker) coming up to me and calling me a dick and an asshole and a bitch for calling her mom on her when she was just having some harmless fun. \n\nNow this was literally the same day when we had a MADD presentation at school. \n\nThe following day, she\u2019s back at school and the first thing she does when she sees me is punch me and call me a \u201cfucking life ruining asshole\u201d because on top of no phone and goodbye car, her parents aren\u2019t letting her attend any house parties and are considering not letting her go to after-prom. \n\nWas I the asshole for doing this? Because honestly, I kinda feel I am. I mean if something had happened and her car crashed and they died and I hadn\u2019t done anything, I\u2019d feel guilty for not doing anything. But now I feel guilty because I got her in trouble with her parents. And we used to be really good friends but in the last month, since she punched me, we haven\u2019t talked at all which kinda hurts. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author of this AITA story is in the wrong. The situation is about a 17-year-old who called their friend's mom because the friend was driving under the influence after a party. The friend ended up getting grounded, losing her phone and car, and even punched the author. Now the author feels guilty for both getting her in trouble and losing a friend.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author's friend was at a party where there was a lot of drinking and drug use. The author tried to get her to take an Uber but failed. Then saw her driving while impaired and contacted her mom. The result was disciplinary action from the parents and social backlash from classmates.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFrom a legal and safety perspective, driving under the influence is extremely dangerous. The author was trying to prevent a potential accident or worse. By contacting the friend's mom, they took a responsible action to ensure their friend's safety and possibly others on the road. However, the social repercussions are significant\u2014losing a friend and facing judgment from peers. \n\nBut the core issue is about preventing harm. The author's action was motivated by concern, even if it led to negative consequences. The friend was at risk of causing a tragic accident, which could have been worse. The author might not have been in the wrong from a moral standpoint because they acted to prevent potential harm. However, some might argue that the author overstepped by involving the parents without the friend's consent. \n\nOn the other hand, the friend was engaging in risky behavior, and the author's intervention stopped a potentially life-threatening situation. The author's intent was to help, even if it caused immediate problems. The fact that the friend was a minor (16 at the time) adds weight to the idea that adults (like parents) should be involved in such situations. \n\nSo considering all that, the author's actions were aimed at preventing a dangerous situation, which is generally seen as the right thing to do. Even though it led to the friend being grounded and the friendship breaking down, the primary concern of safety seems to justify the action. Therefore, the answer would likely be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
