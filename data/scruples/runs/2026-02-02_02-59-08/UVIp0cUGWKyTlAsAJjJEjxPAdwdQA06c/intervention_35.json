The party started first as a small gathering of friends drinking beer, eating pizza, watching movies. Someone posted on our grad Facebook page about this gathering and before I knew it there were like 50-60 people over smoking weed, drinking vodka and a bunch of other shit. I\u2019m not a smoker or drinker, so I left pretty quickly. My friend, who\u2019s also a grade 12 but was 16 at the time of this event, stayed. \n\nNow I\u2019m back home, reading, watching TV whatever. I\u2019m been on my phone, watching people Snapchat and Instagram\u2019s stories. In one, my friend is the focus where she\u2019s chugging a bottle of vodka, in another she\u2019s smoking a joint and in a third, she\u2019s doing shots with a guy. I know that she drove to the party so I text her to call an Uber. When she doesn\u2019t reply, I call her. She picks up and complains that Uber\u2019s too expensive so I offer to call one for her. She hangs up after saying she\u2019s fine to drive. \n\nMaybe 30 minutes later, I see on one of her friend\u2019s Snapchat story, like 5 different videos of her in the car, driving while smoking and drinking and texting on her phone and one video of them in a Macdonald\u2019s that was posted like 2 mins ago. \n\nI call my friend\u2019s mom and tell her what\u2019s happening. She says thanks and hangs up. I don\u2019t hear from her or her daughter for the rest of the night. \n\nShe\u2019s not at school the next day but I hear from from my friends and classmates that her mom and dad grounded her, taking away her phone for like 6 months and selling her car. All day, I had people, mostly her friends and other classmates who\u2019ve posted videos of themselves drinking and doing drugs, (hell one of the girls was a 16 who has a tinder account and who keeps a bottle of vodka in her locker) coming up to me and calling me a dick and an asshole and a bitch for calling her mom on her when she was just having some harmless fun. \n\nNow this was literally the same day when we had a MADD presentation at school. \n\nThe following day, she\u2019s back at school and the first thing she does when she sees me is punch me and call me a \u201cfucking life ruining asshole\u201d because on top of no phone and goodbye car, her parents aren\u2019t letting her attend any house parties and are considering not letting her go to after-prom. \n\nWas I the asshole for doing this? Because honestly, I kinda feel I am. I mean if something had happened and her car crashed and they died and I hadn\u2019t done anything, I\u2019d feel guilty for not doing anything. But now I feel guilty because I got her in trouble with her parents. And we used to be really good friends but in the last month, since she punched me, we haven\u2019t talked at all which kinda hurts. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. So the question is whether the author did the wrong thing by calling the friend's mom after she was driving under the influence. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author is 17, at a party that turned big, left early because they don't drink or smoke. Their friend, who was 16, stayed. The author sees the friend on social media doing various bad things, like drinking and smoking, and driving. They try to get her to take an Uber, but she refuses. Then, the author sees her driving while doing even worse stuff\u2014smoking, drinking, texting. So the author calls her mom, who thanks them and hangs up. The friend gets grounded, loses her phone and car. Others are upset and call the author a jerk. The friend punches the author later. Now the author is unsure if they were in the wrong, feeling guilty about getting the friend in trouble but also thinking that if something had happened, they'd feel guilty for not acting.\n\nSo, the key points here are: Was the friend in danger? The friend was driving under the influence, which is a serious offense, especially for a 16-year-old. The author tried to intervene by offering an Uber, but the friend refused. Then, the author saw more risky behavior and decided to inform the parents. The parents took action, which led to the friend's punishment. The friend and others are upset, but the author is conflicted.\n\nNow, considering the options. If the answer is A (yes, the author is in the wrong), maybe because they overstepped by involving the parents without trying other steps first, or because the friend was just having fun and the author ruined her life. But if it's B (not in the wrong), the author was trying to prevent a potential disaster, as DUI is dangerous. The friend put herself and others at risk. The author's actions could have saved lives.\n\nI need to weigh the intent and the consequences. The author's intent was to prevent a possibly fatal accident. The friend was driving dangerously. Even though the friend was upset and the author lost a friend, the author's action was a safety measure. In many cases, people are encouraged to report such situations if they can't stop someone in person. So, maybe the author did the right thing. The friend's anger is understandable but the author's actions were for a good reason. The answer might be B.\n"
