The party started first as a small gathering of friends drinking beer, eating pizza, watching movies. Someone posted on our grad Facebook page about this gathering and before I knew it there were like 50-60 people over smoking weed, drinking vodka and a bunch of other shit. I\u2019m not a smoker or drinker, so I left pretty quickly. My friend, who\u2019s also a grade 12 but was 16 at the time of this event, stayed. \n\nNow I\u2019m back home, reading, watching TV whatever. I\u2019m been on my phone, watching people Snapchat and Instagram\u2019s stories. In one, my friend is the focus where she\u2019s chugging a bottle of vodka, in another she\u2019s smoking a joint and in a third, she\u2019s doing shots with a guy. I know that she drove to the party so I text her to call an Uber. When she doesn\u2019t reply, I call her. She picks up and complains that Uber\u2019s too expensive so I offer to call one for her. She hangs up after saying she\u2019s fine to drive. \n\nMaybe 30 minutes later, I see on one of her friend\u2019s Snapchat story, like 5 different videos of her in the car, driving while smoking and drinking and texting on her phone and one video of them in a Macdonald\u2019s that was posted like 2 mins ago. \n\nI call my friend\u2019s mom and tell her what\u2019s happening. She says thanks and hangs up. I don\u2019t hear from her or her daughter for the rest of the night. \n\nShe\u2019s not at school the next day but I hear from from my friends and classmates that her mom and dad grounded her, taking away her phone for like 6 months and selling her car. All day, I had people, mostly her friends and other classmates who\u2019ve posted videos of themselves drinking and doing drugs, (hell one of the girls was a 16 who has a tinder account and who keeps a bottle of vodka in her locker) coming up to me and calling me a dick and an asshole and a bitch for calling her mom on her when she was just having some harmless fun. \n\nNow this was literally the same day when we had a MADD presentation at school. \n\nThe following day, she\u2019s back at school and the first thing she does when she sees me is punch me and call me a \u201cfucking life ruining asshole\u201d because on top of no phone and goodbye car, her parents aren\u2019t letting her attend any house parties and are considering not letting her go to after-prom. \n\nWas I the asshole for doing this? Because honestly, I kinda feel I am. I mean if something had happened and her car crashed and they died and I hadn\u2019t done anything, I\u2019d feel guilty for not doing anything. But now I feel guilty because I got her in trouble with her parents. And we used to be really good friends but in the last month, since she punched me, we haven\u2019t talked at all which kinda hurts. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author did the wrong thing by calling someone's mom when their friend was driving under the influence. The situation is that the friend was at a party, doing drugs and drinking, then decided to drive. The author tried to stop her by offering an Uber but she refused. Then, seeing more evidence of her driving while impaired, the author contacted the mother.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the situation from different angles. The main issue here is whether the author acted responsibly or overstepped. The key points are the potential danger of the friend's actions, the author's intent to prevent harm, and the resulting consequences like the friend getting grounded. \n\nThe friend was a minor (16 years old), driving while under the influence, smoking, and texting. Those are all high-risk behaviors. The author tried to intervene in multiple ways\u2014first by offering an Uber, then contacting the parent. The parent's reaction was to ground the daughter, which is a common disciplinary action. However, the friend and others are upset, leading to a physical confrontation and a strained friendship.\n\nNow, considering legal and ethical aspects. In many jurisdictions, underage drinking and DUI are serious offenses. The author might be trying to prevent a potential accident. But by calling the mom, the author bypassed the friend and directly involved a parent. Was that necessary? Sometimes, in such situations, people might choose to alert a parent, especially if the friend is in immediate danger.\n\nHowever, there's also the angle of privacy and trust. The author's friend might feel betrayed, leading to the punch and ongoing conflict. The question is whether the author's actions were justified in the face of potential danger versus respecting the friend's autonomy.\n\nThe MADD presentation at school highlights the real-life consequences of DUI, which the author seems to take to heart. The author's hesitation stems from the fear of guilt if something had happened. On the other hand, the author caused immediate personal trouble for the friend, affecting their relationship and social standing.\n\nIn terms of right vs wrong, it's a tricky call. The author acted to prevent a possible tragedy, which is commendable. However, the method of intervention might have been heavy-handed. The author could have considered other approaches first, like informing a teacher or other authority figure at the school, especially since there was a MADD presentation. Alternatively, maybe the friend's parents should have been contacted through a more formal channel instead of directly. \n\nBut in the moment, seeing someone in immediate danger, the instinct to act quickly is understandable. The author's actions prevented a potential DUI accident, which is a serious public safety issue. The friend's reaction, while hurtful, is a consequence of the parent's decision, not the author's action causing the punishment directly. However, the author's role in that decision might be seen as overstepping, depending on the relationship and cultural norms.\n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the author's actions were necessary to prevent harm. In preventing a possible disaster, the author acted with good intentions, but the personal fallout shows the complexity of such decisions. So, the author might not be in the wrong because they tried to prevent a dangerous situation, even if the consequences were unintended.\n"
