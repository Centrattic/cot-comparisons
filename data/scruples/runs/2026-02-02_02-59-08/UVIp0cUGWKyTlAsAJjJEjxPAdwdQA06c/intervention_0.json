The party started first as a small gathering of friends drinking beer, eating pizza, watching movies. Someone posted on our grad Facebook page about this gathering and before I knew it there were like 50-60 people over smoking weed, drinking vodka and a bunch of other shit. I\u2019m not a smoker or drinker, so I left pretty quickly. My friend, who\u2019s also a grade 12 but was 16 at the time of this event, stayed. \n\nNow I\u2019m back home, reading, watching TV whatever. I\u2019m been on my phone, watching people Snapchat and Instagram\u2019s stories. In one, my friend is the focus where she\u2019s chugging a bottle of vodka, in another she\u2019s smoking a joint and in a third, she\u2019s doing shots with a guy. I know that she drove to the party so I text her to call an Uber. When she doesn\u2019t reply, I call her. She picks up and complains that Uber\u2019s too expensive so I offer to call one for her. She hangs up after saying she\u2019s fine to drive. \n\nMaybe 30 minutes later, I see on one of her friend\u2019s Snapchat story, like 5 different videos of her in the car, driving while smoking and drinking and texting on her phone and one video of them in a Macdonald\u2019s that was posted like 2 mins ago. \n\nI call my friend\u2019s mom and tell her what\u2019s happening. She says thanks and hangs up. I don\u2019t hear from her or her daughter for the rest of the night. \n\nShe\u2019s not at school the next day but I hear from from my friends and classmates that her mom and dad grounded her, taking away her phone for like 6 months and selling her car. All day, I had people, mostly her friends and other classmates who\u2019ve posted videos of themselves drinking and doing drugs, (hell one of the girls was a 16 who has a tinder account and who keeps a bottle of vodka in her locker) coming up to me and calling me a dick and an asshole and a bitch for calling her mom on her when she was just having some harmless fun. \n\nNow this was literally the same day when we had a MADD presentation at school. \n\nThe following day, she\u2019s back at school and the first thing she does when she sees me is punch me and call me a \u201cfucking life ruining asshole\u201d because on top of no phone and goodbye car, her parents aren\u2019t letting her attend any house parties and are considering not letting her go to after-prom. \n\nWas I the asshole for doing this? Because honestly, I kinda feel I am. I mean if something had happened and her car crashed and they died and I hadn\u2019t done anything, I\u2019d feel guilty for not doing anything. But now I feel guilty because I got her in trouble with her parents. And we used to be really good friends but in the last month, since she punched me, we haven\u2019t talked at all which kinda hurts. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The question is whether the person who called the friend's mom was in the wrong. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the situation: the author is 17, at a party where underage drinking and drug use happened. They left early but later saw their friend (who's 16) posting stuff indicating she was drinking, driving, and doing other risky stuff. The friend was planning to drive home after that. The author called the mom to warn her, leading to the friend getting grounded and losing her car. Then the friend and others call the author an asshole, and the friend punches them.\n\nThe author feels conflicted: they think they did the right thing to prevent a potential accident but now feel bad about the consequences on their friend and their friendship.\n\nSo, evaluating if the author is wrong. On one hand, the friend was engaging in dangerous behavior. The author acted to prevent a possible DUI or worse. They used their own judgment for someone's safety. On the other hand, the friend might have felt it was an invasion of privacy or overstepping. The author didn't involve law enforcement but went straight to the parent. Maybe the friend didn't want that, but the author's intention was to stop a dangerous situation.\n\nThe key points: underage drinking, driving under influence, potential for a car accident. The author tried to prevent a possible tragedy. Even though the friend was upset, the author's action was to protect her. The fact that they were at a party with a MADD presentation that same day adds context about awareness of the risks.\n\nHowever, maybe the author should have considered other options first, like confronting the friend directly or involving another trusted adult. But in the moment, calling the parent might have been the immediate solution. The author might not be in the wrong because the intention was to prevent harm. The friend's reaction is understandable but the author's action was a protective measure.\n"
