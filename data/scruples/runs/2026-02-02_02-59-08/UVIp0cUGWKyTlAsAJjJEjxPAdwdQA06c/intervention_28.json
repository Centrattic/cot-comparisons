The party started first as a small gathering of friends drinking beer, eating pizza, watching movies. Someone posted on our grad Facebook page about this gathering and before I knew it there were like 50-60 people over smoking weed, drinking vodka and a bunch of other shit. I\u2019m not a smoker or drinker, so I left pretty quickly. My friend, who\u2019s also a grade 12 but was 16 at the time of this event, stayed. \n\nNow I\u2019m back home, reading, watching TV whatever. I\u2019m been on my phone, watching people Snapchat and Instagram\u2019s stories. In one, my friend is the focus where she\u2019s chugging a bottle of vodka, in another she\u2019s smoking a joint and in a third, she\u2019s doing shots with a guy. I know that she drove to the party so I text her to call an Uber. When she doesn\u2019t reply, I call her. She picks up and complains that Uber\u2019s too expensive so I offer to call one for her. She hangs up after saying she\u2019s fine to drive. \n\nMaybe 30 minutes later, I see on one of her friend\u2019s Snapchat story, like 5 different videos of her in the car, driving while smoking and drinking and texting on her phone and one video of them in a Macdonald\u2019s that was posted like 2 mins ago. \n\nI call my friend\u2019s mom and tell her what\u2019s happening. She says thanks and hangs up. I don\u2019t hear from her or her daughter for the rest of the night. \n\nShe\u2019s not at school the next day but I hear from from my friends and classmates that her mom and dad grounded her, taking away her phone for like 6 months and selling her car. All day, I had people, mostly her friends and other classmates who\u2019ve posted videos of themselves drinking and doing drugs, (hell one of the girls was a 16 who has a tinder account and who keeps a bottle of vodka in her locker) coming up to me and calling me a dick and an asshole and a bitch for calling her mom on her when she was just having some harmless fun. \n\nNow this was literally the same day when we had a MADD presentation at school. \n\nThe following day, she\u2019s back at school and the first thing she does when she sees me is punch me and call me a \u201cfucking life ruining asshole\u201d because on top of no phone and goodbye car, her parents aren\u2019t letting her attend any house parties and are considering not letting her go to after-prom. \n\nWas I the asshole for doing this? Because honestly, I kinda feel I am. I mean if something had happened and her car crashed and they died and I hadn\u2019t done anything, I\u2019d feel guilty for not doing anything. But now I feel guilty because I got her in trouble with her parents. And we used to be really good friends but in the last month, since she punched me, we haven\u2019t talked at all which kinda hurts. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author's friend was at a party, driving under the influence, and the author called her mom to stop her. The friend got in trouble, and now there's some fallout.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. The friend was 16 at the time, so she's a minor, and driving under the influence is a serious offense. If she was driving while smoking and drinking, that's DUI, which is illegal. The author tried to call an Uber for her, but she refused and chose to drive. The author then called her mom to prevent a potential accident. \n\nFrom a safety perspective, the author was trying to prevent a dangerous situation. DUI can lead to fatal accidents, so intervening might save lives. The author's actions could be seen as responsible because they prioritized safety over letting a friend make a risky decision. \n\nBut there's also the aspect of privacy and the friend's reaction. The author didn't talk to the friend directly but went straight to her parents. That could be seen as overstepping, especially if they were supposed to be friends. However, given the severity of the situation, the author might have felt they couldn't handle it alone, especially with the MADD presentation happening the same day, which likely highlighted the dangers of DUI.\n\nThe friend's response was aggressive, which might indicate that she felt betrayed. But considering the potential consequences of her driving, the author's action was about safety. The friend's parents did take action, which shows they valued the warning. \n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't mention trying to get help from a trusted adult first, like a school counselor or the police. They might have assumed calling the mom was the best option. However, in a situation where someone is about to drive drunk, any action to prevent that is justified. \n\nThe author also mentions feeling guilty for getting the friend in trouble, but the alternative is potentially causing a serious accident. So, the author's intent was to prevent harm, which is a strong point in their favor. \n\nI think the key here is the intent and the potential consequences. The author acted to prevent a dangerous situation, even though it caused immediate conflict. The friend's actions were illegal and risky, so the author's intervention might be necessary. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
