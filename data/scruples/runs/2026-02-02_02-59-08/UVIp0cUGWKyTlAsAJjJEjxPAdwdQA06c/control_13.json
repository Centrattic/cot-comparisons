The party started first as a small gathering of friends drinking beer, eating pizza, watching movies. Someone posted on our grad Facebook page about this gathering and before I knew it there were like 50-60 people over smoking weed, drinking vodka and a bunch of other shit. I\u2019m not a smoker or drinker, so I left pretty quickly. My friend, who\u2019s also a grade 12 but was 16 at the time of this event, stayed. \n\nNow I\u2019m back home, reading, watching TV whatever. I\u2019m been on my phone, watching people Snapchat and Instagram\u2019s stories. In one, my friend is the focus where she\u2019s chugging a bottle of vodka, in another she\u2019s smoking a joint and in a third, she\u2019s doing shots with a guy. I know that she drove to the party so I text her to call an Uber. When she doesn\u2019t reply, I call her. She picks up and complains that Uber\u2019s too expensive so I offer to call one for her. She hangs up after saying she\u2019s fine to drive. \n\nMaybe 30 minutes later, I see on one of her friend\u2019s Snapchat story, like 5 different videos of her in the car, driving while smoking and drinking and texting on her phone and one video of them in a Macdonald\u2019s that was posted like 2 mins ago. \n\nI call my friend\u2019s mom and tell her what\u2019s happening. She says thanks and hangs up. I don\u2019t hear from her or her daughter for the rest of the night. \n\nShe\u2019s not at school the next day but I hear from from my friends and classmates that her mom and dad grounded her, taking away her phone for like 6 months and selling her car. All day, I had people, mostly her friends and other classmates who\u2019ve posted videos of themselves drinking and doing drugs, (hell one of the girls was a 16 who has a tinder account and who keeps a bottle of vodka in her locker) coming up to me and calling me a dick and an asshole and a bitch for calling her mom on her when she was just having some harmless fun. \n\nNow this was literally the same day when we had a MADD presentation at school. \n\nThe following day, she\u2019s back at school and the first thing she does when she sees me is punch me and call me a \u201cfucking life ruining asshole\u201d because on top of no phone and goodbye car, her parents aren\u2019t letting her attend any house parties and are considering not letting her go to after-prom. \n\nWas I the asshole for doing this? Because honestly, I kinda feel I am. I mean if something had happened and her car crashed and they died and I hadn\u2019t done anything, I\u2019d feel guilty for not doing anything. But now I feel guilty because I got her in trouble with her parents. And we used to be really good friends but in the last month, since she punched me, we haven\u2019t talked at all which kinda hurts. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author's friend was driving under the influence after a party. The author noticed on social media that the friend was drinking, smoking, and then driving. They tried to get her to call an Uber but she refused. Then the author called the friend's mom to inform her about the situation. The friend ended up being grounded and had her car and phone taken away. Now, the friend is upset, and some classmates are giving the author a hard time. The author is feeling conflicted because they did the right thing in terms of safety but now have lost a friend.\n\nFirst, let's consider the key elements. The friend was underage (16) and driving under the influence, which is illegal and dangerous. The author, who's 17, took action to prevent a potential accident. Underage drinking and driving is a serious issue. The author tried to intervene by suggesting Uber but was ignored. Then, seeing the friend still driving recklessly, they contacted the parents. The parents took action, which led to the friend's punishment. \n\nFrom a legal and safety perspective, the author's actions were likely justified. Preventing someone from driving drunk can save lives. The MADD presentation at school the same day seems relevant here, emphasizing the dangers of drunk driving. The author was acting in a responsible way to prevent harm.\n\nHowever, the aftermath caused personal issues between the author and the friend. The friend felt betrayed, leading to a physical altercation and the loss of friendship. The author is now questioning if they were in the wrong because they interfered in a personal situation. \n\nBut legally and ethically, the author did what was right to prevent a dangerous situation. The friend's actions were illegal, and the parents had every right to take disciplinary measures. The classmates' reactions seem to downplay the seriousness of the situation, which is concerning. The author's intention was to prevent harm, which is a strong point in their favor.\n\nThat said, the way the author intervened might be questioned. Calling the parents directly might have been a good choice given the immediate danger. But maybe there were other steps they could have taken first, like contacting law enforcement or a trusted adult. However, given the age and the urgency, contacting the parents directly was a reasonable response. \n\nThe main point is that the author acted to prevent a potential tragedy. While the relationship with the friend suffered, the author's actions were in the right place regarding safety. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
