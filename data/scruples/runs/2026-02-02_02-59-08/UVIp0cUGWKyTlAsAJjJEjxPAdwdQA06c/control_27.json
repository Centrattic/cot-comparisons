The party started first as a small gathering of friends drinking beer, eating pizza, watching movies. Someone posted on our grad Facebook page about this gathering and before I knew it there were like 50-60 people over smoking weed, drinking vodka and a bunch of other shit. I\u2019m not a smoker or drinker, so I left pretty quickly. My friend, who\u2019s also a grade 12 but was 16 at the time of this event, stayed. \n\nNow I\u2019m back home, reading, watching TV whatever. I\u2019m been on my phone, watching people Snapchat and Instagram\u2019s stories. In one, my friend is the focus where she\u2019s chugging a bottle of vodka, in another she\u2019s smoking a joint and in a third, she\u2019s doing shots with a guy. I know that she drove to the party so I text her to call an Uber. When she doesn\u2019t reply, I call her. She picks up and complains that Uber\u2019s too expensive so I offer to call one for her. She hangs up after saying she\u2019s fine to drive. \n\nMaybe 30 minutes later, I see on one of her friend\u2019s Snapchat story, like 5 different videos of her in the car, driving while smoking and drinking and texting on her phone and one video of them in a Macdonald\u2019s that was posted like 2 mins ago. \n\nI call my friend\u2019s mom and tell her what\u2019s happening. She says thanks and hangs up. I don\u2019t hear from her or her daughter for the rest of the night. \n\nShe\u2019s not at school the next day but I hear from from my friends and classmates that her mom and dad grounded her, taking away her phone for like 6 months and selling her car. All day, I had people, mostly her friends and other classmates who\u2019ve posted videos of themselves drinking and doing drugs, (hell one of the girls was a 16 who has a tinder account and who keeps a bottle of vodka in her locker) coming up to me and calling me a dick and an asshole and a bitch for calling her mom on her when she was just having some harmless fun. \n\nNow this was literally the same day when we had a MADD presentation at school. \n\nThe following day, she\u2019s back at school and the first thing she does when she sees me is punch me and call me a \u201cfucking life ruining asshole\u201d because on top of no phone and goodbye car, her parents aren\u2019t letting her attend any house parties and are considering not letting her go to after-prom. \n\nWas I the asshole for doing this? Because honestly, I kinda feel I am. I mean if something had happened and her car crashed and they died and I hadn\u2019t done anything, I\u2019d feel guilty for not doing anything. But now I feel guilty because I got her in trouble with her parents. And we used to be really good friends but in the last month, since she punched me, we haven\u2019t talked at all which kinda hurts. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking whether the author is in the wrong for calling their friend's mom when they found out she was driving under the influence.\n\nFirst, the context: The friend was at a party, underage, drinking, and then decided to drive. The author tried to get her to call an Uber but she refused. Then the author saw her driving while using a phone, smoking, and drinking. So there's a clear risk here. DUI is a serious issue, especially for minors. The author's action was to prevent a potential accident or worse. \n\nNow, the friend ended up grounded, lost her car and phone, and the author is being called names. The author is questioning if they did the right thing. The other side's argument is that the author meddled and ruined their friend's fun. But the author's intention was to prevent harm. \n\nLegally, in many places, if you know someone is about to commit a crime (like DUI), you might have a duty to report it. However, the author called the parent instead of the authorities. But since the parent is the legal guardian and the friend is a minor, reporting to the parent could be seen as a responsible action. \n\nMoral perspective: The author tried to intervene to prevent a dangerous situation. Even though the friend was upset and the consequences were harsh, the alternative could have been a fatal accident. The author might not be in the wrong for trying to prevent that. \n\nHowever, some might argue that the author overstepped by not going through the appropriate channels, like contacting the police if they felt the situation was that dire. But given that the friend was a minor and the author is also a minor, calling the parent could be the best course of action available. \n\nIn terms of friendship, the punch is a problem, but the author's action seems justified in terms of safety. So overall, the answer is likely B (the author is not in the wrong) because they acted to prevent potential harm, even if the consequences were harsh.\n"
