The party started first as a small gathering of friends drinking beer, eating pizza, watching movies. Someone posted on our grad Facebook page about this gathering and before I knew it there were like 50-60 people over smoking weed, drinking vodka and a bunch of other shit. I\u2019m not a smoker or drinker, so I left pretty quickly. My friend, who\u2019s also a grade 12 but was 16 at the time of this event, stayed. \n\nNow I\u2019m back home, reading, watching TV whatever. I\u2019m been on my phone, watching people Snapchat and Instagram\u2019s stories. In one, my friend is the focus where she\u2019s chugging a bottle of vodka, in another she\u2019s smoking a joint and in a third, she\u2019s doing shots with a guy. I know that she drove to the party so I text her to call an Uber. When she doesn\u2019t reply, I call her. She picks up and complains that Uber\u2019s too expensive so I offer to call one for her. She hangs up after saying she\u2019s fine to drive. \n\nMaybe 30 minutes later, I see on one of her friend\u2019s Snapchat story, like 5 different videos of her in the car, driving while smoking and drinking and texting on her phone and one video of them in a Macdonald\u2019s that was posted like 2 mins ago. \n\nI call my friend\u2019s mom and tell her what\u2019s happening. She says thanks and hangs up. I don\u2019t hear from her or her daughter for the rest of the night. \n\nShe\u2019s not at school the next day but I hear from from my friends and classmates that her mom and dad grounded her, taking away her phone for like 6 months and selling her car. All day, I had people, mostly her friends and other classmates who\u2019ve posted videos of themselves drinking and doing drugs, (hell one of the girls was a 16 who has a tinder account and who keeps a bottle of vodka in her locker) coming up to me and calling me a dick and an asshole and a bitch for calling her mom on her when she was just having some harmless fun. \n\nNow this was literally the same day when we had a MADD presentation at school. \n\nThe following day, she\u2019s back at school and the first thing she does when she sees me is punch me and call me a \u201cfucking life ruining asshole\u201d because on top of no phone and goodbye car, her parents aren\u2019t letting her attend any house parties and are considering not letting her go to after-prom. \n\nWas I the asshole for doing this? Because honestly, I kinda feel I am. I mean if something had happened and her car crashed and they died and I hadn\u2019t done anything, I\u2019d feel guilty for not doing anything. But now I feel guilty because I got her in trouble with her parents. And we used to be really good friends but in the last month, since she punched me, we haven\u2019t talked at all which kinda hurts. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author (the person who called the friend's mom) is in the wrong. The situation involves underage drinking, driving under the influence, and the aftermath.\n\nFirst, the author is 17, and their friend is 16 but in grade 12. The party got big with a lot of drinking and drug use. The author left early because they don't drink or smoke. Then, they saw their friend's Snapchat stories showing her drinking, smoking, and driving. The author tried to convince her to get an Uber but she refused. So they called her mom. The friend's parents grounded her, took the phone and car. Now the friend and others are upset, the author feels guilty, and they had a physical altercation.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author did the right thing. On one hand, the friend was driving under the influence, which is dangerous. The author tried to prevent a potential accident. The fact that there was a MADD presentation the same day might be a clue that the school was emphasizing the dangers of DUI. So by calling her mom, the author might be seen as preventing a possible tragedy.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author overstepped by not going through the friend first or involving a parent directly. The friend might have felt her privacy was violated, and the parents' punishment was strict. The author's friend and others are upset, leading to a breakdown in their friendship.\n\nBut underage drinking and driving is illegal and dangerous. The author acted to prevent harm. Even though it caused personal issues, the main action was to stop a potential accident. The friend chose to drive while impaired, which is the real problem. The author's actions, though causing trouble with her family and friends, were in line with preventing a more serious consequence. So, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
