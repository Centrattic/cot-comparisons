He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"What Would I Be To Apologize For\" (WIBTA) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend who started a company and asked another person (the author) to design a website and POS system. They had a verbal agreement for payment of $2000 and 5% equity. The author worked on it for eight weeks, then was ghosted. Now, the company is successful, and the author considers disrupting the company to get what they believe is owed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. The agreement was verbal, which in many jurisdictions is still a valid contract if there's an offer, acceptance, and consideration. However, proving the terms might be difficult without written evidence. The author hasn't been paid, so there's a potential breach of contract. But without a written contract, enforcing it could be challenging. \n\nThen there's the ethical angle. The author put in time and effort expecting payment and equity. Being ghosted and then seeing the company's success without compensation could be seen as unfair. However, taking actions to disrupt the company, even if motivated by a sense of justice, could be considered unethical or even illegal. Harming someone's business is generally frowned upon, regardless of the circumstances.\n\nEmotional and personal factors are also at play. The friendship was close, and the betrayal could be deeply hurtful. The author might feel justified in their actions due to the emotional and financial loss. On the other hand, disrupting the business could cause more harm than good, and the author might not be able to prove their claims in court, leading to potential legal repercussions for them.\n\nThe author still has control over the domain and code, but they're considering using that to their advantage. While they might have legal rights to those assets, using them to damage the company could be seen as extortion or theft, depending on the jurisdiction. \n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, the author might be in the right regarding the unpaid debt, but the method of seeking recompense is questionable. Legal action would be the appropriate route, but taking matters into their own hands (like disrupting the company) is likely wrong, regardless of the provocation.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the author is in the wrong for planning to disrupt the company. They should pursue legal avenues to address the unpaid debts and equity, rather than taking retaliatory actions. While the friend's actions were unethical, the author's response would be equally, if not more, problematic.\n"
