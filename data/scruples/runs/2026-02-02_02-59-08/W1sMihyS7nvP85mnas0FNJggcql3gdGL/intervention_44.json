He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a friend who started a company and asked the author to design the website and POS system. There was a verbal agreement for $2000 and 5% stake. The author worked on it, then was ghosted. Now the friend is successful, and the author is considering causing trouble to get the money and stake.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. A verbal agreement can be tricky. While it's possible to enforce it, it's hard without evidence. The author might not have a strong legal case here. But the ethical side is another matter. The friend didn't follow through on the agreement, which is dishonest. However, the author is considering retaliatory actions that could harm the friend's business. \n\nThe author's actions\u2014like taking down the website or POS system\u2014could be seen as sabotage. Even if the friend was wrong, the author's response is illegal and unethical. Sabotage is a criminal act, regardless of the reason. The author might have a right to be upset, but their proposed action is not a valid way to address the issue. They should seek legal advice instead of taking matters into their own hands.\n\nSo, even though the friend is at fault for not honoring the agreement, the author's plan to disrupt the company is wrong. The answer is A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
