He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the Redit-style post is in the wrong for considering disrupting their former friend's successful company.\n\nFirst, the initial agreement was verbal. In many jurisdictions, verbal agreements can be legally binding if there's an offer, acceptance, and consideration, but proving them can be tough without evidence. The key here is whether there's enough proof for the author to claim they have a valid legal right to payment or equity. If there's no written contract, the author might struggle in court, especially if the friend denies the agreement.\n\nNext, the author did the work, but the friend didn't pay. Now, the company is successful, and the author is thinking of sabotaging it. The question is about whether the author is in the wrong. Legally, sabotage is clearly illegal, regardless of the grievance. So if the author goes through with disrupting the company's systems, they could face criminal charges for things like hacking or interfering with business operations.\n\nEthically, even if the author feels wronged, the response of causing harm could be seen as excessive. Revenge isn't typically considered a justifiable action, even if there's a perceived injustice. The author might have other avenues, like legal recourse, but intentionally damaging the company could be viewed as malicious.\n\nAlso, the author still holds ownership of the domain and hosting, and some code. They might have a claim to those assets, but intentionally disrupting them would cross into illegal activity. If they were to release the code or take down the site, that's a different issue than asserting ownership.\n\nSo, while the original dispute might have merit, the proposed action of \"fucking his shit over\" is not legally or ethically justified. The author could be in the wrong if they proceed with such actions, regardless of their grievances.\n"
