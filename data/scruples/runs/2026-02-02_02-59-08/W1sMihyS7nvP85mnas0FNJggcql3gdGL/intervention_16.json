He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this story is in the wrong. The situation is about a friend who started a company and asked the author to design the website and POS system. They had a verbal agreement for $2000 plus 5% equity. The author worked on it, but after finishing, the friend ghosted them. Now the friend is successful, and the author is considering disrupting the company to get their money and stake.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. There's a verbal agreement, which in many places is legally binding, but it's hard to enforce without proof. The author did the work, but the friend didn't pay. The author is now thinking of taking action by disrupting the company's systems since they still have access. The question is about whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nThe author's actions could be seen as revenge. Even if they were wronged, taking matters into their own hands by hacking or sabotaging the company's systems is illegal and unethical. The friend might have breached the contract, but that doesn't justify illegal actions. The author could have legal recourse, like going to court to claim the money and equity, but breaking into the company's systems is a criminal act.\n\nAlso, the author still has control over the domain and hosting, which they set up. They might have a legitimate claim to those assets. However, using that control to disrupt operations would be problematic. The author's anger and desire for justice are understandable, but the method of seeking it is not the right approach.\n\nAnother angle: the friend's actions (ghosting, not paying) were wrong, but the author's response is not the solution. There's a difference between being wronged and committing a crime. The author could be held legally responsible if they sabotage the company. Even if they feel entitled, the law doesn't condone such actions.\n\nI should also consider if there's any ambiguity. Maybe the verbal agreement was clear, but without evidence, it's hard to prove. The author might have a case in court, but that's a legal process. Sabotage is not a legal remedy. So, the author is likely in the wrong because their actions would be illegal regardless of the situation.\n"
