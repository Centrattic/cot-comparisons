He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author helped a friend start a company by designing a website and a point of sale system. They had a verbal agreement where the author was supposed to get $2000 and a 5% stake. The friend didn't pay and now the company is super successful. The author is considering disrupting the friend's business because of this.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. Verbal agreements can be tricky. While they are legally binding in some places, proving the terms might be hard, especially if there's no written documentation. The friend might argue there was never a formal agreement, so the author might not have a strong legal case. That being said, the author still owns the domain and hosting under their name, and their code is being used. Maybe there's something there about intellectual property rights. If the author hasn't transferred those rights, the friend might be using them without permission, which could be a legal issue.\n\nThen there's the ethical side. The friend didn't follow through on the agreement, which is clearly unethical. The author was promised payment and a stake, and instead, they were ghosted. The friend's actions were dishonest and broken trust is a big deal. But does that justify the author taking revenge by disrupting the business? Vengeance isn't usually seen as a good solution, even if the other party was wrong. The author's plan to \"fuck his shit over\" sounds like retaliation, which might be seen as wrong regardless of the friend's actions. However, the author is trying to seek justice for being wronged, which could be seen as understandable, but the method is problematic.\n\nThe author's emotional response is understandable. They invested time and work, were cut off, and now the friend is successful without acknowledging them. But using the access they have to interfere with the business could lead to legal consequences. Even if the friend is in the wrong, the author's actions could be illegal, especially if they tamper with the website or POS system. That might not just be morally wrong but also a criminal act.\n\nAlso, the original agreement was verbal, which might not hold up in court. The author might not be able to enforce the 5% stake or the $2000 payment through legal means. So, the author's plan might be based on a shaky foundation. Even though the friend is in the wrong, the author's approach is not a legal or ethical way to resolve the issue. They should probably seek legal advice to pursue any claims they have, rather than taking matters into their own hands.\n\nIn summary, while the friend definitely broke the agreement and acted wrongfully, the author's plan to retaliate by disrupting the business is not the right approach. They are in the wrong because their actions are illegal and vengeful, even if the friend is the one who initially wronged them. The correct course of action would be to go through legal channels to seek the compensation they were promised, not to sabotage the business.\n"
