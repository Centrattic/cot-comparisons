He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend who started a company and asked the author to design a website and POS system. They had a verbal agreement for $2000 plus 5% equity. The author worked on it, but after completion, the friend ghosted them. Now the company is successful, and the author is considering disrupting it to get their money and stake.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. Verbal agreements can be tricky. In many jurisdictions, they are legally binding, but proving the terms might be difficult. The author hasn't received payment or equity, which is a breach of contract. However, without written evidence, it's hard to enforce. The author still holds the domain and hosting under their name, which gives them some leverage. The POS system and code are still in use, so there's intellectual property involved here. If the author removes access, they could be infringing on the company's operations, but they might also have a claim to compensation.\n\nEthically, the friend broke the agreement and ghosted, which is unfair. The author's anger is understandable, but taking revenge by disrupting the company could be seen as overstepping. Even if they have a valid claim, using disruptive tactics might not be the best approach. Legally, the author might have grounds to sue for breach of contract and unpaid services, but taking unilateral action could lead to legal trouble for the author as well, especially if it's considered sabotage.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Legally, they might not be, but ethically, disrupting the company could be seen as wrong. However, the friend's actions were clearly in the wrong. The author's potential actions could be justified as self-help, but it's a gray area. The answer likely depends on jurisdiction and specific laws, but generally, the author isn't in the wrong for seeking what they believe is owed, but the method of disruption might be questionable.\n"
