He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering disrupting their friend's company. The situation involves a verbal agreement for payment and equity in exchange for designing a website and POS system. The friend didn't follow through on payments, and now the author is contemplating some form of retaliation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. Verbal agreements can be tricky. While they are legally binding in some jurisdictions, proving the terms might be difficult. The author mentions a \"gentlemen's agreement\" which is essentially a verbal contract. However, without written evidence, it's hard to enforce. The friend ghosted them, so there's no official documentation of the agreement's terms. Legally, the author might not have a strong case because of the lack of written proof, even if the friend benefited from their work.\n\nNext, ethical considerations. The author put in a significant amount of work, and the friend didn't honor the agreement. The author feels wronged, especially since the company has become successful. However, taking actions to disrupt the company, like removing access to the domain or code, could be seen as unethical. Even if the author owns the domain and code, using that as leverage for revenge might cross ethical lines. The question is whether the ends justify the means. Retaliation, even if justified in emotion, might not be ethically sound as it could harm others, like employees or the business itself.\n\nEmotional and personal relationships play a role here. The author mentions a 15-year friendship that's now over. The betrayal of trust and lack of communication from the friend has caused emotional distress. But retaliating in a way that disrupts the company could be seen as taking personal vendettas too far. It's important to consider if the author's actions would be viewed as vengeful rather than just seeking compensation.\n\nPractical implications: If the author goes through with disrupting the company, they might face legal consequences. For example, if they remove access to critical systems, the friend could sue for damages. Even though the author might have a claim to the code, maliciously disrupting operations could be considered a different legal issue. Additionally, the author's actions could damage their own reputation if discovered.\n\nThere's also the aspect of whether the author is entitled to the equity. Since the agreement was verbal and there's no proof, the friend might argue that there was no binding agreement. The designer was paid, but the author wasn't, which highlights the lack of clear terms. The friend's actions of not paying could be seen as unethical, but the author's retaliation might not be justified in the eyes of the law or society.\n\nIn summary, while the author has valid grievances and the friend's actions were unethical, the author's potential actions to disrupt the company could be seen as wrong. The lack of legal enforceability of the verbal agreement and the ethical implications of retaliation suggest that the author is in the wrong if they proceed with disruptive actions. The correct course would be to pursue legal avenues if possible, but taking personal revenge is not justified.\n"
