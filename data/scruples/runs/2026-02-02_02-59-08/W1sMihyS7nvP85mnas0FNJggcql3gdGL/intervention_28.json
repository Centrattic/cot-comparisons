He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author did some work for their friend's company six years ago. They had a verbal agreement for payment and a stake, but then the friend ghosted them after the work was done. Now, the friend is successful, and the author is considering disrupting his business to get what's owed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. Verbal agreements can be tricky. In many jurisdictions, verbal contracts are legally binding, but proving them can be hard without any evidence. The author mentions a \"gentleman's agreement\" which is essentially a verbal contract. The problem is that the friend isn't acknowledging it, so the author might not have a strong legal case. If the author decides to disrupt the company, they might be committing a crime themselves, like hacking or sabotage. Even if they feel wronged, taking illegal actions could put them in trouble.\n\nThen there's the moral side. The author worked hard, put other projects on hold, and didn't get any compensation. The friend became successful without giving credit or payment. On the surface, it seems unfair. But the author's plan to \"fuck his shit over\" is pretty extreme. Even if they have access to the domain and code, using that to harm the friend's business could be seen as taking the law into their own hands. It's a form of retaliation that might not be justified, even if the friend wronged them.\n\nThe author's emotional journey is important too. They mention stewing in emotions for years and feeling betrayed. However, using their technical access to disrupt the business could backfire. It might lead to legal consequences for the author, damage their reputation, and possibly cause more harm than good. There might be better ways to seek resolution, like sending a formal demand letter, consulting a lawyer, or trying to reach an amicable settlement.\n\nAlso, the friend's side isn't clear. Maybe there's a reason he didn't pay, like financial difficulties or a change in business plans. Without knowing his side, it's hard to judge. The author could be jumping to conclusions. However, the friend's ghosting and lack of communication suggest bad faith.\n\nIn terms of ethics, while the friend's actions were unethical (not paying for work done), the author's plan to disrupt the company is also unethical and potentially illegal. The right approach would be to seek legal remedies rather than taking matters into their own hands. The author's anger and desire for revenge might overshadow the need for a lawful resolution.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the author is in the wrong because their intended action is illegal and unethical, even if the friend's actions were wrong. The proper course is to pursue legal avenues rather than sabotage.\n"
