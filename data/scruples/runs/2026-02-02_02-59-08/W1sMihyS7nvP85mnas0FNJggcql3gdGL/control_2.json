He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. So the user is asking if the author is in the wrong in a situation where they're considering disrupting their friend's successful company because they weren't paid for their work on a website and POS system. The friend started a multi-million-dollar company six years ago and had a verbal agreement to pay the author $2000 plus a 5% stake. The author did the work, but after finishing, the friend ghosted them. Now the friend is a millionaire, using the author's code without payment, and the author is thinking of taking action.\n\nFirst, the verbal agreement. In many jurisdictions, verbal agreements can be legally binding, but proving them can be tough. The author has no written contract, which might complicate things if they take legal action. However, the fact that the domain and webhost are in the author's name suggests they might have ownership rights over the code. If the author hasn't transferred those, then the friend might be using the work without legal right. That could be a point in the author's favor.\n\nNext, the friend's actions. Ghosting the author and not paying the agreed-upon compensation is a clear breach of the verbal agreement. The friend also didn't inform the author about the marriage, which adds to the personal betrayal. But the author is considering \"fucking his shit over,\" which could mean sabotage. Is that justified? While the friend is in the wrong for not paying, the author is considering illegal or unethical actions in response. Even if the author has a valid grievance, disrupting the company could lead to legal consequences for the author. The question is whether the author's actions are justified or if they're overstepping.\n\nThe legal angle: The author might have a case for breach of contract (verbal or not) and could pursue legal action to claim payment and the 5% stake. But if they instead choose to sabotage the company, that's a different matter. Sabotaging someone's business is illegal and unethical, regardless of the prior dispute. The author might have rights to the code, but using that to disrupt the company could result in their own legal trouble, like intentional interference with business or even criminal charges if they delete or damage systems.\n\nMoral/ethical perspective: Even if the friend is a bad actor, taking revenge through sabotage is not the right approach. The author's emotions are valid\u2014feeling betrayed and not paid\u2014but the response needs to be lawful. The author might be justified in seeking compensation through legal means, but not in harming the friend's business. The fact that the friend is using the author's code without permission is a separate issue; the author could demand payment or return of their work, but destroying it would be akin to blackmail or extortion.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that the friend hired a designer who was paid but not given a stake. The author was promised a stake but not paid. The friend's actions of not paying either of them (but the designer was paid) might indicate a pattern of not honoring agreements, which supports the author's claim. However, the designer's case isn't part of the current question.\n\nIn conclusion, while the friend is clearly in the wrong for not honoring the agreement, the author's plan to disrupt the company is unethical and illegal. They have legal avenues to pursue compensation and enforce their rights over the code. Choosing to sabotage the business, even if motivated by past wrongs, makes the author complicit in illegal activity. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for considering such actions.\n"
