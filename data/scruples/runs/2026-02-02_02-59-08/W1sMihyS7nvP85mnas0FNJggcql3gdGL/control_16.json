He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the WIBTA scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend who started a company and asked the author to design his website and POS system. There was a verbal agreement for $2000 plus 5% equity. The author did the work, but the friend never paid and cut off communication. Now the company is worth millions, and the author is considering disrupting it to get what they believe is owed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. Verbal agreements can be tricky. While there might be some legal standing depending on the jurisdiction, proving the terms could be difficult. The author mentions having the domain and hosting in their name, which might be a point in their favor regarding ownership of the code. However, the company is using the POS system, which could imply some form of implied contract or license, even without a written agreement.\n\nEthically, the friend broke the agreement by not paying and cutting off contact. The author feels wronged and is considering retaliatory actions. But taking down the company's systems would likely be illegal, regardless of the grievance. Even if the author owns parts of the code, sabotaging a business is a criminal act and could lead to legal consequences.\n\nThe author's plan to \"fuck his shit over\" is a form of revenge, which is generally not condoned. While the friend's actions were unethical, the author's response crosses into illegal territory. The appropriate course of action would be to pursue legal remedies, like small claims court, but actual sabotage is not acceptable.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Legally, sabotaging the company is illegal. Ethically, while the friend wronged them, revenge is not justified. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for planning to disrupt the company. However, the friend was also wrong for not honoring the agreement. But the question is specifically about the author's actions. Since their actions are illegal and vengeful, the answer would be A (Yes, in the wrong).\n"
