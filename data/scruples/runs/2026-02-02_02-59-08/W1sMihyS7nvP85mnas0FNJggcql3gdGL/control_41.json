He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the \"Would I Be Terrible for...\" scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a friend who started a company and asked the author to design his website and POS system. There was a verbal agreement for $2000 and 5% stake. The author worked on it, but after finishing, was ghosted. Now, years later, the friend is successful, and the author is considering disrupting his company to get what's owed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. The agreement was verbal, which might not hold up in court. But some jurisdictions do recognize verbal contracts, especially if there's evidence of performance. The author did the work, and the friend hasn't paid. However, without a written contract, it's tricky. The author might not have a legal claim, but that's a separate issue from moral or ethical responsibility.\n\nEthically, the friend promised payment and a stake but didn't follow through. The author fulfilled their part by doing the work. The friend then cut off communication, which is inconsiderate. But the author is now considering disrupting the company, which is a form of revenge and could be illegal (like sabotaging systems). Even if the friend is in the wrong, the author's actions could cause harm beyond what's necessary. For example, destroying the website or POS system could affect employees, customers, and the business's operations, which isn't just about recovering the debt.\n\nAlso, the author still has access to the domain and hosting. Legally, they might have a claim to those assets since they're in their name. Instead of sabotaging, they could try to negotiate, sell the assets for payment, or take legal action. Disruption without legal recourse could make the author liable for damages or criminal charges if it's considered sabotage.\n\nSo, while the friend is clearly in the wrong for not honoring the agreement and cutting off contact, the author's plan to disrupt the company is not a justified response. The ends don't justify the means here. The author should pursue legal channels rather than take matters into their own hands with actions that could be illegal and cause unnecessary harm. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for planning to sabotage the company.\n"
