He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a friend who started a company and asked the author to design a website and point of sale system. There was a verbal agreement for $2000 and 5% stake. The author worked on it but then wasn't paid, was ghosted, and now the friend is successful. The author is considering disrupting the friend's business to get their money and stake.\n\nFirst, I need to think about the legal aspects. Verbal agreements can be tricky. In many places, they're legally binding but hard to prove. The author might not have solid evidence of the agreement, which could be an issue. Also, the friend didn't pay and hasn't acknowledged the author. The author has access to the domain and hosting, and their code is still in use. But does that mean they have a legal right to shut it down?\n\nThen there's the moral side. The author worked hard, was betrayed, and now wants revenge. But disrupting the friend's business could be seen as wrong, even if the friend was dishonest. The author has the technical ability to do so, but is that justified?\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for planning to disrupt the friend's company. If the author takes such action, they might be committing a crime, like computer sabotage. Even if the friend was in the wrong, the author's actions could lead to legal trouble. So, from a legal standpoint, the author might be in the wrong by taking matters into their own hands. Morally, it's a gray area\u2014revenge vs. justice.\n\nAlso, considering that the friend is now a millionaire, and the author is seeking compensation, maybe there's a way to legally pursue payment. But the author is thinking of disrupting the business, which is more about revenge than getting paid. That could make the author's actions morally questionable.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author might be in the wrong because using disruptive tactics is illegal and not the right way to handle a dispute, regardless of the friend's actions. Even if the friend broke the agreement, the author should pursue legal avenues instead of taking revenge.\n"
