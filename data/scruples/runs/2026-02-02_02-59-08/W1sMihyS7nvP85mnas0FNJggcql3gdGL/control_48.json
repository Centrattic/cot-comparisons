He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is complicated, so I need to break it down step by step. \n\nFirst, there's a \"friend\" who started a company six years ago. He asked the author to design his website and point of sale system. They had a verbal agreement where the author would get $2000 and 5% of the company. But there's no written contract. The author worked on this project, putting other projects aside, and spent two weeks functional and six weeks on tweaks. The friend also hired a designer who was paid $2000 upfront but didn't get a stake. \n\nAfter finishing the work, the friend ghosted the author, not replying to messages. The author tried to maintain the friendship but didn't get a response beyond occasional likes or comments. Now, the friend's company is successful with multiple stores and he's a millionaire. The author hasn't received payment or acknowledgment. The author still has access to the domain and hosting, and some of their code is still in use. The friend has had someone else maintain the systems but the original work is still there. The author is considering disrupting the friend's company to get what they're owed.\n\nSo the question is, is the author in the wrong? Let's look at the legal and ethical aspects. \n\nLegally, verbal agreements can be binding, but they're hard to enforce, especially without evidence. The author might have a case if they can prove the terms of the agreement, but without a written contract, it's tricky. The friend might argue that there was no formal agreement. However, the designer was paid upfront, which might imply that the friend intended to pay others but not the author. \n\nEthically, the friend didn't fulfill the agreed-upon terms, which is unfair. The author worked hard and sacrificed other projects, expecting payment and a stake. The friend's ghosting and lack of communication add to the ethical issues. \n\nBut the author is considering illegal actions, like disrupting the friend's company. Even if the friend is at fault, taking matters into one's own hands by sabotaging a business is illegal and unethical. The author could face legal consequences for such actions. \n\nSo, while the friend may have wronged the author, the author is in the wrong if they plan to disrupt the company. The proper course would be to seek legal advice, send a demand letter, or pursue mediation, not take retaliatory actions. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong for planning to disrupt the company), but the friend is also at fault. However, the question specifically asks if the author is in the wrong, so the answer is A.\n"
