He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering disrupting their friend's successful company. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, there's a verbal agreement from six years ago where the author was to be paid $2000 plus 5% equity for designing a website and POS system. The friend started a company, and the author put other projects on hold to work on this. The work took eight weeks, and after completion, the friend ghosted them, cutting off communication. The friend is now a millionaire with multiple stores, using the author's code and systems, which the author still owns. The author is considering \"fucking his shit over\" as revenge for not getting paid and losing the friendship.\n\nSo, the main points here are the enforceability of the verbal agreement, ownership of the work, and the morality of the author's potential actions. \n\nIn terms of legal standing, verbal agreements can be tricky. Without written documentation, it's hard to enforce, especially if there's no evidence of the equity stake. The author might not have a legal claim, but that's not the only factor here. The fact that the domain and hosting are in the author's name suggests they might still hold some legal rights over the code, which complicates things. If the author removes or alters the systems, that could be a breach of terms, even if the friend hasn't paid.\n\nMorally, the friend's actions were clearly wrong\u2014ghosting, not paying, and using the work without compensation. However, the author's threat of retaliation could be seen as taking justice into their own hands. Disrupting the company could cause harm beyond just addressing the unpaid debt, affecting employees, customers, and others involved. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. From a legal perspective, if the author takes action against the systems they own, it might be a gray area. But ethically, revenge in this form could be considered wrong because it goes beyond seeking compensation and into sabotage. The author might have legal recourse through small claims court or other means to seek payment, but direct sabotage is more about punishment than justice. Also, the author's actions could lead to legal retaliation from the friend, especially if they damage the company's operations. \n\nConsidering all these factors, while the friend clearly wronged the author, the author's plan to disrupt the company could be seen as morally wrong because it's an act of vengeance that could cause unnecessary harm. The right approach would be to pursue legal remedies rather than taking matters into one's own hands. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for considering such actions despite the initial injustice.\n"
