He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"What Would Be The Aftermath\" (WIBTA) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend who started a company and promised payment and a stake in exchange for designing a website and POS system. The author did the work but wasn't paid, leading to a falling out. Now, the friend is successful, and the author is considering disrupting the company to get what they believe is owed.\n\nFirst, the legal aspect: The agreement was verbal, which in many places is still legally binding, but proving it can be tough. The author has some leverage since they own the domain and hosting, and parts of the code are still in use. However, using that leverage to disrupt the company could be illegal, like hacking or sabotage. Even if they have ownership of the domain, intentionally causing harm could lead to legal consequences for the author.\n\nEthically, the situation is murky. The friend did promise payment and a stake, which wasn't fulfilled. The author worked on it, put other projects on hold, and then was ghosted. The emotional aspect is significant\u2014feeling betrayed and wronged. But taking revenge by damaging the company might not be justified, even if the friend is at fault. It's a cycle of retaliation that could hurt both parties.\n\nMoral responsibility: While the friend clearly broke the agreement, the author's response of \"fucking his shit over\" is extreme. Even if the author is in the right in terms of the original deal, escalating to sabotage is likely to make them the wrongdoer. There might be other ways to seek compensation, like legal action or negotiation, but taking direct action to disrupt the business is not advisable.\n\nAlso, the author is still the domain and code owner technically, but if they have exclusive rights, they might have legal recourse without resorting to sabotage. However, if they start tampering with systems or leaking information, that crosses into illegal territory regardless of the original grievance.\n\nIn conclusion, even though the friend is at fault for not honoring the agreement, the author's plan to disrupt the company would likely make them wrong under both legal and ethical standards. The correct approach would involve legal means to recover what's owed rather than taking matters into their own hands. So the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because their actions, while understandable in context, are not justified.\n"
