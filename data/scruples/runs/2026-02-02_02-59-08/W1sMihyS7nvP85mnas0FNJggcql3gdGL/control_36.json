He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author in the given scenario is in the wrong. Let me break down the details.\n\nSo, the author was a friend who agreed verbally to design a website and POS system for his friend's company. The agreement was $2000 plus 5% stake. The author put in a lot of work, delayed other projects, and the friend later ghosted him, never paying. Now the company is worth millions, and the author is considering disrupting the company to get his money and stake.\n\nFirst, the main issue is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider legal and ethical aspects. Verbally agreements can be tricky legally. The author might have a case if he can prove the agreement existed, but without written proof, it's hard. However, the author still has control over the domain and hosting, and their code is still in use. That gives them a position to leverage.\n\nEthically, the friend broke the agreement and didn't honor the terms. The author was left unpaid and lost a friendship. The friend's success is built on the author's work. But does that justify the author disrupting the company now? The author is considering causing harm, which could be seen as retaliation, even if they feel wronged.\n\nLegally, if the author removes or disrupts the systems they control, it might be considered sabotage or theft of services, depending on the jurisdiction. Even if the original agreement was verbal, the author's actions could lead to legal trouble. Ethically, while the friend is at fault for not paying, the author's response could be seen as harmful and excessive.\n\nSo, the author has a valid grievance, but taking action to disrupt the company might not be justified, both legally and ethically. The answer is probably A (the author is in the wrong) because their planned action is harmful, regardless of the original issue. They should pursue legal means to resolve the payment issue instead of retaliating.\n"
