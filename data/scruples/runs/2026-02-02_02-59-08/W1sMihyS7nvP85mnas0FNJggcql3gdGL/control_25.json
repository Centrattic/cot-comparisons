He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the question again carefully.\n\nThe situation is about a friend who started a company six years ago. He asked the author to design his website and POS system. There was a verbal agreement for $2000 plus 5% stake. The author worked on it for two weeks and then another six weeks for tweaks. The friend hired a designer for the frontend, who got paid $2000 upfront but no stake. After the work was done, the friend ghosted the author, didn't pay, and the author hasn't heard from him for years. Now the company is successful with multiple stores, and the author is considering disrupting the company to get payment. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the legal and ethical aspects here. The key points are the verbal agreement, non-payment, and the author's current plans to disrupt the company.\n\nVerbal agreements can be legally binding, but they're harder to enforce. However, in some jurisdictions, they might not be as strong as written contracts. The problem here is that there's no written proof of the agreement beyond a gentlemen's agreement. The author might have a hard time proving the terms, especially the 5% stake, in a court of law. \n\nEthically, the author did the work, and the friend reneged on the agreement. The friend is now successful and hasn't paid the author. The author is frustrated and considering retaliatory actions. But is the author in the wrong for planning to disrupt the company? \n\nIf the author is considering actions like using their access to the domain, webhost, or code to sabotage the company, that's illegal. Even if the author has a grievance, intentional sabotage would be a criminal act and could lead to legal consequences. The fact that the author still has access to some systems (like the domain and webhost) doesn't justify illegal activity. \n\nHowever, the author might have legal recourse through a civil lawsuit if they can prove the verbal agreement. But taking the law into their own hands by disrupting the company is another matter. So ethically, while the friend is in the wrong for not paying, the author's plan to disrupt the company is also wrong because it's illegal and crosses the line from seeking compensation to causing harm.\n\nAnother angle: the author's argument is based on the idea that they were promised payment and a stake, and the friend broke that promise. But the author's response is to retaliate, which is not the appropriate legal or ethical response. The correct action would be to seek legal advice and pursue a claim through the courts. \n\nAdditionally, the author's claim about still owning the code and having access to the domain might have some legal merit if they can prove ownership. But even then, using that to disrupt the company would be illegal. For example, if the domain is registered under the author's name, they might have the right to transfer it, but doing so without a court order could be considered a civil wrong. \n\nIn terms of morality, the author's actions would be seen as revenge rather than justice. The friend's betrayal is bad, but the author's plan to sabotage is also harmful and potentially illegal. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for planning to disrupt the company through illegal means.\n"
