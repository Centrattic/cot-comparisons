He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this situation. So, the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering to disrupt their former friend's company. Let me break down the details.\n\nFirst, the author helped their friend start a company by designing the website and POS system six years ago. There was a verbal agreement for $2000 plus 5% of the company. The author put in a lot of time and effort, working on the project for weeks. However, after the work was done, the friend ghosted them, leading to a breakdown in their friendship. Now, the company is successful with multiple stores, and the author hasn't received any payment or acknowledgment. They still have control over the domain and hosting, and parts of the code are still in use. The author is considering taking action to disrupt the company in retaliation for the unpaid work and lost friendship.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the verbal agreement, the lack of a formal contract, and the current situation where the author has legal ownership of some assets. The first thing that comes to mind is that verbal agreements can be tricky legally. Without a written contract, it's hard to enforce the terms, especially if the other party denies the agreement. The friend might argue that there was no formal agreement, making it hard for the author to claim the 5% stake or the $2000. However, the author still has control over the domain and hosting, which are critical assets. If they were to take them down, that could cause significant issues for the company.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong for considering this? Well, taking legal action to reclaim assets they own (like the domain and hosting) might be justified, especially if they hadn't transferred ownership. However, the idea of \"completely fucking his shit over\" sounds more like sabotage rather than legal recourse. Destroying the company's systems or data would likely be illegal, regardless of the situation. Even if the author feels wronged, intentionally damaging someone else's property (even if they contributed to it) could lead to legal consequences.\n\nOn the other hand, the friend did breach the verbal agreement by not paying and cutting off communication. The author might have a case for the unpaid work, but without a formal contract, it's harder to prove. The author's access to the domain and hosting could be points in their favor if they were never formally transferred. But using that access to disrupt operations could still be considered a criminal act, like cyber sabotage or theft.\n\nSo, while the author might have a valid grievance regarding the unpaid work and breach of trust, their potential actions could cross into illegal territory. The right approach would be to seek legal advice to recover what's owed through proper channels, rather than taking matters into their own hands. Disrupting the company could be seen as the author's wrongdoing, even if the friend was initially at fault.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong if they proceed with sabotage. They might have a case for the unpaid work, but their method of addressing it is inappropriate and illegal.\n"
