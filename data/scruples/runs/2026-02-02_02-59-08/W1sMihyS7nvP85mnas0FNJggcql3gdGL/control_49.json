He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author of the \"Would I Be Terrible for...\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend who started a company and asked the author to design the website and POS system. They had a verbal agreement for $2000 and 5% stake. The author worked on it, but the friend ghosted them after, didn't pay, and now the company is successful. The author is considering disrupting the company to get what they believe is owed.\n\nFirst, I need to think about legal aspects. A verbal agreement can be legally binding, but it's harder to enforce, especially without written proof. The friend didn't pay, so the author might have a case for breach of contract. However, since it's a verbal agreement, proving the terms could be difficult. The author still has control over the domain and hosting, which might give them legal standing to take action if they can prove ownership.\n\nBut then there's the moral aspect. The author mentions they wanted their friend back initially but now are considering disrupting the company. Destroying someone's business could be seen as extreme, even if they owe money. The friend has moved on, married, and the author wasn't invited to the wedding. The author's actions could be considered retaliation rather than just legal recourse.\n\nAlso, the author is in a position where they have access to the systems. Taking down the website or POS could cause significant harm. Even if they are owed money, disrupting a multi-million dollar company might be illegal, like sabotage. There could be criminal charges involved if they interfere with business operations.\n\nThe designer was paid up front but didn't get a stake. The author got neither payment nor stake. But the author's threat to disrupt the company might affect not just the friend but employees and customers, which complicates things ethically.\n\nSo, legally, the author might have a case for unpaid work, but taking matters into their own hands by disrupting the company could be illegal. Morally, it's questionable because it's a personal vendetta. The right approach would be to pursue legal channels, like small claims court, to recover the $2000 and possibly the stake, but actively damaging the company's operations is wrong.\n\nTherefore, the answer is that the author is in the wrong (A) because their proposed actions are illegal and unethical, regardless of the original dispute.\n"
