He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering disrupting their friend's company. The situation involves a verbal agreement for payment and a stake in the company. The friend didn't pay and hasn't communicated, leading the author to consider taking action now.\n\nFirst, verbal agreements can be tricky. Legally, they can be enforceable, but it's harder to prove terms without written evidence. The author did the work, but the friend ghosted them. The author hasn't received payment or the promised stake. Now the company is successful, and the author has control over the domain and code.\n\nThe key points: Was there a valid contract? Verbal agreements can hold up, but proving terms is tough. The author might have a case for payment and ownership of the code. However, taking action to disrupt the company could be illegal, like sabotage or intellectual property theft. Even if the author owns the code, using it to harm the company could be problematic. The friend might have a defense if he believed he owned the code now. Also, the author's plan to \"fuck his shit over\" sounds like retaliation, which could lead to legal consequences regardless of the initial dispute.\n\nEthically, revenge isn't a good basis for action. Legally, the author might have grounds for a lawsuit for breach of contract, but taking unilateral action could backfire. The author should consider legal channels first. So, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because disrupting the company could be illegal and unethical, regardless of the initial dispute.\n"
