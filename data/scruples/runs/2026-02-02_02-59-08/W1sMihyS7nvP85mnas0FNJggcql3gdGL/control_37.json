He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"What Would I Be Today\" (WIBTA) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend who started a company and asked the author to design his website and POS system. They had a verbal agreement of $2000 plus 5% stake. The author worked on it, got ghosted, and now the friend is successful. The author is considering disrupting the company to get what's owed.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author has a legal or ethical claim. Verbal agreements can be tricky; they might not hold up in court, especially without evidence. The author mentions having the domain and hosting under their name, and some code still in use. That might give them some legal standing, maybe ownership over parts of the software. But the stake in the company was part of the verbal agreement. Without a written contract, proving that could be tough.\n\nEthically, the friend didn't follow through on the agreement, which is wrong. The author did the work as agreed. But the author is considering disruptive actions, like removing access or damaging the systems. Even if they have a claim, taking revenge by disrupting the company could be illegal or unethical. Harming someone's business, even if they wronged you, is likely not advisable. The author might have legal recourse through small claims court or a lawyer, but taking matters into their own hands by \"fucking his shit over\" would probably be in the wrong.\n\nSo, the author might have a point in feeling wronged, but their plan to disrupt the company is not justified. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) regarding their initial situation, but their proposed action is problematic. Wait, the question is if the author is in the wrong in the situation described. The situation includes the consideration of disrupting the company. So, even if the friend was wrong, the author's plan to retaliate would be in the wrong. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they're planning to disrupt the company, which is an illegal or unethical act regardless of the past agreement. Even if they have a case, taking revenge is not the right approach. So, the author is in the wrong for planning to disrupt the company despite the prior issues.\n"
