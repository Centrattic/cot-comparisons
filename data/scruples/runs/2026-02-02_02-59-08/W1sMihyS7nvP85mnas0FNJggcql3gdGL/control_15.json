He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for considering disrupting their former friend's company over an unpaid agreement. \n\nFirst, there's the verbal agreement. They had a gentleman's agreement for $2000 plus 5% stake. But verbal agreements can be tricky, especially without any written proof. The friend didn't even have the tools to make invoices initially. The author worked on the project, putting other projects aside, and the friend ghosted them after completion. The designer was paid upfront but didn't get a stake, while the author didn't get either payment or the stake. Now the friend is successful, and the author is considering taking action.\n\nLegally, verbal agreements can be enforceable but hard to prove. Since there's no written contract, it might be tough for the author to claim the money or stake. The friend could argue that the agreement was never formalized. However, the author still holds the domain and hosting under their name, and some code remains in use. This could be a point in the author's favor if they decide to take legal action, but using it to disrupt the company might be seen as revenge rather than legal recourse.\n\nEthically, the author's anger is understandable given the friend's betrayal. But considering the lack of a written agreement and the time that's passed, the author's threat to disrupt the company could be seen as overstepping. It's possible that the friend never intended to honor the verbal agreement, or maybe he forgot. Either way, the author's response\u2014threatening to sabotage the business\u2014might be considered wrong because it's harmful and not through proper channels. Instead of legal action or seeking payment through legitimate means, the author is considering revenge, which is morally questionable.\n\nAlso, the author mentions they didn't care about the money initially but wanted their friend back. Now, years later, the emotional hurt might be driving this decision. But using their technical access to harm the friend's company could lead to legal consequences for the author, especially if the friend sues for damages. The author might also lose any remaining friendship and face public backlash.\n\nIn summary, while the friend's actions were unethical and probably wrong, the author's plan to disrupt the company is also unethical and potentially illegal. The correct course would be to seek legal advice to pursue payment, not to take matters into their own hands. So, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
