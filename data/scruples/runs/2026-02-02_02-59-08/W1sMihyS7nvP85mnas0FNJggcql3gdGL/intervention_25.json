He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So the user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is a bit complex, so I need to break it down.\n\nFirst, the author helped their friend set up a website and POS system six years ago. They had a verbal agreement for $2000 and a 5% stake. The friend never paid and now has a successful business. The author is considering disrupting the friend's company to get what they're owed. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but they want to know what I think.\n\nHmm. Let me start by considering the legal aspect. Verbal agreements can be tricky. In many jurisdictions, a verbal contract can be legally binding, but it's often hard to prove. The author might have a case, but without documentation, it's tough. The friend's actions of ghosting the author could be seen as a breach of contract. However, the friend might argue that they never intended to honor the verbal agreement, especially if there's no written record. The author's possession of the domain and hosting under their name might give them some legal standing, but it's still a gray area.\n\nEthically, the author is considering sabotage. Regardless of the legal situation, sabotaging someone's business is clearly unethical. Even if the author feels wronged, taking revenge by disrupting the company is not a socially acceptable or moral response. The author could pursue legal action, like suing for breach of contract, but using their access to cause harm is a different matter. It's about intent\u2014revenge vs. seeking compensation through proper channels.\n\nThe friend's behavior is inexcusable. Ghosting someone, not paying for services rendered, and not acknowledging a long-term friend is wrong. The friend should have honored the agreement or at least communicated. But the author's response is equally problematic. Instead of going through the courts or negotiating, they're contemplating sabotage. That's not a constructive solution and could lead to legal repercussions for the author, like theft or sabotage charges.\n\nAnother angle: the author's own role. They created a system that's still in use, but they haven't maintained it. They were paid by the designer, but the author wasn't. The friend might not know the extent of the author's contributions, but the author had the opportunity to enforce their rights earlier. Letting it fester for six years without trying to resolve it legally or through communication could be seen as enabling the situation.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the author has grievances that might have legal merit, but their intended action is morally wrong. Sabotage is never the right answer, regardless of the provocation. The author should seek legal recourse, not take matters into their own hands. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for planning to disrupt the friend's company, even if the friend is also at fault.\n"
