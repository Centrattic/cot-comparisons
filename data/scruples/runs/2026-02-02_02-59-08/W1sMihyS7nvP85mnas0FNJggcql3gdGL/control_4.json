He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that a friend started a company six years ago and asked the author to design his website and point of sale system. They had a verbal agreement where the author would get $2000 plus 5% stake. The author worked on it, put other projects on hold, and then got ghosted after finishing the work. Now the friend is successful, and the author hasn't been paid. The author is considering disrupting the company to get what they're owed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. A verbal agreement can be tricky. In many places, contracts for services over a certain amount need to be in writing to be enforceable. But the author mentions a \"gentlemen's agreement,\" which might not hold up in court. However, there's also the part where the author still has control over the domain and hosting, which are in their name. That could be a legal point, as intellectual property ownership might still belong to the author if there's no signed contract transferring rights.\n\nThen there's the question of ethics. Did the author have an agreement? Even if it's verbal, if there's mutual understanding and the work was done, the friend might be in breach of that agreement by not paying. The author's frustration is understandable, but taking actions like disrupting the company could lead to legal trouble. Even if the author feels wronged, using illegal methods to retaliate might not be justified.\n\nAlso, the friend's actions of ghosting and not maintaining communication are bad. But the author's proposed solution\u2014completely fucking over the company\u2014might cross a line. Even if the author has a case, destroying someone's business could be considered malicious and illegal, regardless of the situation.\n\nAnother angle is the concept of mitigation. The author could be legally required to mitigate their losses, which might involve negotiating or taking legal action rather than sabotaging. The author's actions could lead to criminal charges or civil liability for damages, which would put them in the wrong.\n\nHowever, if the author is trying to recover what's owed, maybe under the law, they should pursue legal channels. Using underhanded methods could backfire. So, while the friend is at fault for not honoring the agreement, the author's proposed response is problematic.\n\nIn summary, the author might have a legitimate grievance but is in the wrong if they act unlawfully to resolve it. The correct approach would be to seek legal remedies rather than taking matters into their own hands. So the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because disrupting the company would be an illegal and unethical response, regardless of the initial dispute.\n"
