He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this \"Would I Be Terrible for...\" scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend who started a company and asked the author to design a website and POS system. They had a verbal agreement for $2000 plus 5% stake. The author worked on it, but after completion, the friend ghosted them. Now the friend is successful, and the author is considering disrupting the company to get their money and stake.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the legal aspects. Since there's no written contract, the verbal agreement might not hold up in court. The author did the work and provided the systems. The friend didn't pay and now uses the author's work without compensation. However, the author still holds the domain and hosting in their name, and some code is still used.\n\nThe key points here are the lack of a formal contract and the author's intent to take action. Legally, without a contract, it's hard to enforce the payment or stake. The author might not have the right to disrupt the company's operations. Even if there's a valid claim, taking action like destroying the system would be illegal and could lead to criminal charges. \n\nEthically, while the friend's actions are deceitful, the author's plan to sabotage is also wrong. Retaliation through destructive means is not a justified response. The author should pursue legal avenues, like sending a demand letter or small claims court if possible, but not take matters into their own hands.\n\nAlso, the author still has ownership of the domain and hosting. They might have legal standing to reclaim or sell that information, but intentionally causing harm crosses a line. The potential for the author to be in the wrong is high because their actions would be illegal regardless of the friend's wrongdoing.\n\nSo, considering both legal and ethical angles, the author is in the wrong if they proceed with disrupting the company. The correct answer should be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
