He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author of the WIBTA question is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend who started a company and asked the author to design the website and POS system. They had a verbal agreement for $2000 and a 5% stake. The author did the work, but the friend never paid and cut off contact. Now the author is considering disrupting the friend's company to get what's owed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. A verbal agreement is generally valid, but proving it can be tough. The author might have a case in some jurisdictions, but without written evidence, it's weak. The friend's actions of ghosting and not paying are morally questionable. However, the author's threat to disrupt the company is problematic.\n\nOn the moral side, the friend didn't follow through on the agreement, which is unfair. But the author planning to \"fuck his shit over\" is a form of revenge and could be illegal. Even if the author has some legal claim, taking action like removing code or causing damage could lead to legal trouble for the author. They might be violating laws like breach of contract, but their retaliation could be considered sabotage or theft, which is also illegal.\n\nEmotionally, the author feels wronged and wants justice. But the method of seeking that justice is aggressive and harmful. Even if the friend is in the wrong for not paying, the author's response could make them complicit in illegal activities. The author might have a valid grievance, but their approach is problematic.\n\nAnother angle: the author still has access to the domain and hosting. If the friend never transferred ownership, the author might legally own those assets. But using that to disrupt the company could be seen as using legal rights in a harmful way. It's a gray area. However, the author's actions would likely be considered unethical, even if they have a point about the unpaid work.\n\nIn summary, while the friend's actions were wrong, the author's plan to retaliate is not justified and could lead to further issues for them. The author is in the wrong for planning to disrupt the company in a harmful manner.\n"
