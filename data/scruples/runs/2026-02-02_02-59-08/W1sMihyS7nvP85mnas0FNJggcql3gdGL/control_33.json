He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this \"Would I Be Terrible for...\" scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend who started a company and asked the author to design a website and point of sale system. They had a verbal agreement for $2000 plus 5% equity. The author worked on it, but after completing the work, the friend ghosted them. Now the company is successful, and the author is considering disrupting it to get their money and stake.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the legal and ethical aspects. Verbally agreements can be tricky. Legally, a verbal contract can be valid but hard to enforce without evidence. The author might not have a strong legal case here unless they can prove the agreement existed. Ethically, the friend broke the agreement, which is bad. The author was promised payment and equity but got nothing. The friend also ghosted them, which is a breach of trust.\n\nHowever, the author is now considering \"fucking his shit over,\" which implies some form of sabotage. That's where it gets complicated. Even if the friend is at fault, does that justify illegal or unethical actions by the author? Sabotaging the company could be illegal, like destroying property or disrupting business operations. The author still has access to the domain and code, but using that access to harm the company could lead to legal consequences.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that the friend hired someone else to maintain the work, and some of the original code is still in use. The author might have a claim to some intellectual property rights since there was no formal transfer. But using that to disrupt the company could be seen as taking the law into their own hands. Even if the friend is in the wrong, the author's response could be considered wrongful because it's an illegal act.\n\nEthically, some might argue that the friend is the one at fault, but the author's actions could be seen as revenge rather than a legal pursuit. The right approach would be to seek legal recourse, like suing for breach of contract. But since the author is considering sabotage instead, that's where they might be in the wrong. It's not about whether the friend is right or wrong, but about the author's actions being illegal and unethical.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the friend broke the agreement and didn't pay, but the author's plan to disrupt the company is illegal and unethical. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
