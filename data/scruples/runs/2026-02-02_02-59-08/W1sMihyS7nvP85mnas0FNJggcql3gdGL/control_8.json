He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering disrupting their friend's company. The situation involves a verbal agreement for payment and a stake, which wasn't fulfilled. The friend became successful using the author's work without compensation.\n\nFirst, the verbal agreement's enforceability is a key point. In many jurisdictions, verbal contracts can be binding but are hard to prove. Since there's no written evidence, the friend might not be legally obligated to pay. However, ethically, the friend didn't honor the agreement, which is a problem.\n\nThe author's actions\u2014like maintaining access to the domain and code\u2014could be seen as holding leverage. But using that leverage to disrupt the company might cross into illegal territory, such as theft or sabotage. Even if the author feels wronged, taking matters into their own hands by damaging the business could lead to legal consequences like breach of contract, theft of intellectual property, or even criminal charges if it's considered vandalism.\n\nOn the other hand, the friend's actions were unethical, not following through on a verbal agreement and cutting off communication. But that doesn't justify the author's potential retaliation. The proper course would be to pursue legal avenues, like small claims court, to seek payment. Disrupting the company could be seen as taking the law into one's hands, which isn't advisable.\n\nSo, while the friend is in the wrong for not honoring the agreement, the author's plan to disrupt the company is also wrong. They should seek legal recourse instead of personal retaliation. Therefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
