He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author helped a friend start a company by designing their website and POS system six years ago. They had a verbal agreement of $2000 plus 5% equity. The friend didn't pay and ghosted them, became successful, and now the author is considering disrupting the company to get what they feel is owed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. Verbal agreements can be tricky. In many places, contracts for services over a certain amount need to be in writing to be enforceable. Since the author mentions a \"gentlemen's agreement\" with no formal contract, it might be hard to prove legally. The friend might argue that there was no formal agreement, so the author can't claim the money or equity. Also, the author still has control over the domain and hosting, which might mean they have legal rights to the code. But if they didn't transfer ownership, maybe they can claim ownership of the code. However, using someone else's code without permission could be a problem for the friend, but the author disrupting the company could lead to legal issues for them too, like theft of trade secrets or sabotage.\n\nThen there's the ethical angle. The friend didn't follow through on the agreement, which is unethical. But the author's plan to \"fuck his shit over\" is clearly retaliation. Even if the friend was in the wrong, taking matters into your own hands by disrupting a business is generally not considered ethical. It's a form of revenge that could cause harm beyond just the financial dispute. The author might feel wronged, but the response could be seen as disproportionate.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that they want to disrupt the company for $2000 and potential equity. The friend is now a millionaire, so maybe the author feels it's about justice. However, the method they're considering (sabotage) is not a legal or ethical way to seek compensation. The right approach would be to pursue legal action, like small claims court if the amount is within that range, or consulting a lawyer to explore options. But if the agreement isn't enforceable, maybe there's nothing the author can do legally.\n\nAnother point: the author has access to the systems and code. If they remove or disrupt those, it could be considered a criminal act, like destroying property or interfering with business operations. Even if the code is theirs, the company is using it now, so removing it without notice could cause harm. The author might lose any potential legal standing if they act out of court.\n\nIn terms of friendship, the friend's behavior was definitely wrong. Ghosting and not paying as agreed damaged the relationship. But the author's retaliation would be equally harmful and likely end any chance of reconciliation or legal recourse.\n\nSo putting it all together: Legally, the author might not have a strong case due to the verbal agreement. Ethically, their plan to disrupt the company is wrong because it's sabotage. The right approach would be to seek legal advice rather than taking revenge. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for planning to disrupt the company, even if the friend was unfair.\n"
