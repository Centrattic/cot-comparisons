He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. So, the situation is about a friend who started a company and asked the author to design his website and POS system. They had a verbal agreement for $2000 and 5% stake. The author worked on it, but then the friend ghosted them, and now the company is successful. The author is considering messing up the friend's company because they feel cheated.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. Let me break down the key points. The agreement was verbal, which is a gentleman's agreement. In many jurisdictions, verbal contracts can be legally binding, but they can be harder to enforce. The friend didn't pay the $2000 or give the 5% stake. The author still has control over the domain and hosting, and their code is still in use. The friend has since hired others to maintain the system.\n\nNow, the author is contemplating disrupting the friend's company. The question is whether the author is in the wrong if they do so. Legally, even if the author has a claim for unpaid services, taking retaliatory actions like disrupting the company would likely cross the line into illegal activities. The author might have a valid claim for breach of contract, but seeking revenge through sabotage is not a legal recourse. Additionally, even if the author has ownership of the domain and code, using that to disrupt the company could lead to legal consequences like intentional infliction of harm or tortious interference. \n\nEthically, it's a gray area. The friend breached the agreement, but the author's response could be seen as unjustified retaliation. The author could pursue legal action to recover the $2000 and the 5% stake. However, taking actions to intentionally harm the company is not a proper way to enforce a claim. The author might be in the wrong because their actions would be illegal and unethical, regardless of the friend's initial wrongdoing. \n\nAlso, considering the passage of time\u2014six years have passed. Depending on the jurisdiction, the statute of limitations for contract disputes might have expired. So even if the author has a case, it might be too late to legally enforce it. Therefore, the author's plan to disrupt the company could be both legally and ethically wrong, as it's not a valid legal action but rather revenge. \n\nIn conclusion, even though the friend is at fault for breaching the agreement, the author would be in the wrong if they retaliate by disrupting the company. Legal steps should be taken, but direct sabotage is not justified.\n"
