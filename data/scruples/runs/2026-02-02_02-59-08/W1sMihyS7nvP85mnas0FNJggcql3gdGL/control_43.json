He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend who started a company and asked the author to design the website and POS system. They had a verbal agreement for $2000 and 5% stake. The author did the work, but the friend ghosted them, didn't pay, and now the company is successful. The author is considering disrupting the friend's business to get what's owed.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the legal aspects. A verbal agreement can be legally binding, but proving its terms might be difficult. Since there's no written contract, the author would have to rely on evidence like communication records or witness accounts. However, the friend might dispute the terms, especially the 5% stake. The author still owns the domain and hosting, which could be a point in their favor regarding intellectual property.\n\nEthically, the friend broke the agreement by not paying and cutting off communication. The author feels wronged and is considering taking drastic actions. However, taking revenge by disrupting the business could be seen as unethical, even if the friend was at fault. The author's actions, like removing access or sabotaging the systems, could lead to legal trouble, such as theft of property or breach of contract claims.\n\nThe author's motivation is understandable\u2014unpaid work and lost friendship. But the method of seeking retribution is problematic. Instead of disrupting the business, legal avenues like small claims court (for the $2000) or a lawsuit for the 5% stake might be more appropriate. However, given the time that's passed, there might be statute of limitations issues, depending on the jurisdiction.\n\nAlso, the author still has control over some assets (domain, hosting, code). Legally, if the work was done as an independent contractor without a written agreement transferring ownership, the author might retain rights. But if the work was done under an implied agreement, the situation could be different. The friend's use of the POS system and code could be a basis for a claim, but again, proving ownership without a contract is tough.\n\nIn terms of morality, while the friend was clearly in the wrong initially, the author's plan to \"fuck his shit over\" crosses into revenge, which isn't typically seen as morally justified. The author might feel it's fair, but it's not a legal or ethical solution. The right course would be to pursue legal remedies rather than take matters into their own hands.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the author is in the wrong for planning to disrupt the friend's business through unethical means, even if the friend breached the agreement. The correct approach is to seek legal advice to pursue the owed payment and stake, not to retaliate.\n"
