He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a friend who started a company and asked the author to design his website and point of sale system. They had a verbal agreement of $2000 plus a 5% stake. The author worked on it, but after finishing, the friend ghosted them. Now the company is successful, and the author is considering disrupting it to get their money and stake.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. The agreement was verbal, which might not hold up in court. In many places, contracts for services can be verbal, but proving the terms might be difficult. The author has the domain and webhost in their name, so maybe they have legal ownership of those assets. The POS system is still being used, which could mean the author still holds the copyright unless transferred. If they didn't transfer the rights because they weren't paid, then the friend might not legally own the code. \n\nOn the other hand, the friend might argue that the work was done under an implied contract, or that the verbal agreement isn't enforceable. The author's threat to disrupt the company could be seen as retaliation, which isn't illegal per se, but could have legal consequences if they actually do something harmful. Like, if they take down the website or disable the POS system, that could be considered sabotage or theft, leading to legal trouble for the author.\n\nEthically, the friend broke the verbal agreement by not paying and cutting off communication, which is bad. But the author's response of \"fucking his shit over\" is also unethical and potentially illegal. Even if the author has a legitimate grievance, taking matters into their own hands by disrupting the business could make them at fault. \n\nSo, the author might have a point about the friend's breach of agreement, but their plan to retaliate could put them in the wrong legally and ethically. The correct approach would be to pursue legal channels to claim what's owed, not to take destructive actions. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for planning to disrupt the company rather than seeking proper recourse.\n"
