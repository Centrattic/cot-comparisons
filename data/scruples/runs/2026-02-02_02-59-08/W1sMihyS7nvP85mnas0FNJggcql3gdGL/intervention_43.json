He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Would I Be Terrible for...\" post is in the wrong. Let me break down the scenario step by step.\n\nFirst, the author designed a website and POS system for a friend's company six years ago. They had a verbal agreement: $2000 plus 5% stake. The friend didn't have the tools to make invoices initially. The author worked for two weeks to get it functional, then six more weeks on tweaks. A designer was hired for the frontend, paid $2000 upfront but no stake. After completion, the author was ghosted. No payment, no stake, and the friend became distant. Now the friend is a millionaire with a successful company, using the author's work. The author is considering disrupting the company to get what they believe is owed.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to evaluate both sides. \n\nVerbal agreements can be legally valid but are harder to enforce. The author might have a case for breach of contract, but without written proof, it's tough. The friend's actions\u2014ghosting and not paying\u2014definitely seem unethical. However, the author now wants to sabotage the company. That's where the moral line is crossed. Even if the friend is in the wrong, retaliating by disrupting the business is illegal and unethical. The author could take legal action, like suing for the payment and stake, or using their control over the domain and code to negotiate. Sabotage would cause harm beyond just financial claims and could lead to legal consequences for the author.\n\nLegally, the author might have a claim for unpaid services, but taking matters into their own hands by interfering with the company's operations is a different issue. Ethically, revenge through sabotage is problematic. The author has the right to seek compensation through proper channels, not through destructive actions. So while the friend is clearly at fault for breaching the agreement, the author is also in the wrong for considering such extreme measures. The correct path would be to pursue legal remedies, not destructive ones.\n"
