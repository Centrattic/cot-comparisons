He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in the situation described. The scenario is about a friend who started a company and asked the author to design their website and POS system. They had a verbal agreement for $2000 plus 5% equity. The author worked on it, but after finishing, the friend ghosted them. Now, the friend is successful, and the author is considering disrupting the company to get their money and equity.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. Verbal agreements can be tricky. In many jurisdictions, certain contracts, like those involving real estate or over a certain amount, need to be in writing to be enforceable. Since this is a $2000 plus equity deal, a verbal agreement might not hold up in court. The author might not have a legal claim here because there's no written contract.\n\nThen there's the ethical side. The friend didn't follow through on the agreement, which is unethical. But the author is considering sabotaging the company now. Even if the friend was wrong, does that justify the author's actions? Retaliation through sabotage is generally considered unethical and possibly illegal. The author could be causing harm that's disproportionate to the original grievance.\n\nAlso, the author still has access to the domain and hosting, and their code is being used. They could potentially make a legal claim over the intellectual property, especially if they didn't transfer the rights. But again, without a written agreement, proving ownership might be difficult. If the author hasn't taken legal action and instead decides to disrupt the company, that could lead to legal trouble for them.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If they go ahead with disrupting the company, they're committing a harmful act, which is wrong regardless of the friend's past actions. Even if the friend is at fault, the author's response crosses a line into illegal or unethical behavior. So the answer would be that the author is in the wrong. The correct choice is A.\n"
