He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"What Would I Be Termed As...\" scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend who started a company and asked the author to design a website and POS system. They had a verbal agreement of $2000 plus 5% equity. The author worked on it, but after finishing, the friend ghosted them. Now, years later, the friend is successful and the author is considering disrupting his company to get what they believe is owed.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the legal aspects. The main issue here is the verbal agreement. In many jurisdictions, verbal contracts can be legally binding, but they're harder to enforce, especially for something like equity stakes. The problem is proving the terms existed. The author has no written proof, which could make it tough to take legal action. If the author decides to disrupt the company's operations, that could be illegal, regardless of the original disagreement. Actions like taking down the website or sabotaging the POS system might constitute theft, sabotage, or breach of computer security laws. Even if the author owns the domain and hosting, intentionally causing harm could still be illegal, depending on the circumstances.\n\nThen there's the ethical angle. While the friend's actions were certainly unethical in not paying and ghosting, seeking revenge by damaging the company might not be the right approach. Ethically, the author might feel wronged, but retaliating in a harmful way could escalate the situation and lead to legal consequences. There's also the question of whether the author has a moral right to disrupt someone else's business, even if they believe they're owed money or equity.\n\nAnother point is the author's ownership of the domain and hosting. If the domain is registered under their name, they have some legal standing over that asset. However, the POS system and code might be a gray area. If the author hasn't transferred the intellectual property rights, they might still own the code. But using that as leverage by threatening to take it down could be considered blackmail or extortion, which is illegal. Even if they own parts of the code, intentionally disabling systems could be seen as malicious damage.\n\nThe friend's actions were clearly unethical\u2014breaking the agreement, not paying, and cutting off communication. But the author's potential actions could cross legal boundaries. The right course would be to pursue legal remedies, like small claims court if possible, or negotiating a settlement. Taking matters into one's own hands through sabotage isn't advisable and could lead to criminal charges or civil liability.\n\nIn summary, while the friend is at fault for not honoring the agreement, the author could be in the wrong if they take illegal actions to retaliate. The appropriate response would be through legal channels, not disruptive measures. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong (A), as their potential actions could be illegal and unethical, even if the friend's behavior was wrong.\n"
