He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves a friend who started a company and asked the author to design the website and point of sale system. There was a verbal agreement for $2000 and a 5% stake. The author worked on it, but after completion, the friend ghosted and didn't pay. Now the friend's company is successful, and the author is considering disrupting it to get their money and stake.\n\nFirst, the legal aspect. Verbal agreements can be tricky. In many jurisdictions, contracts for services over a certain amount need to be in writing to be enforceable. Since this was a verbal agreement, especially for a 5% stake in a company, it might not hold up in court. The author might not have a legal claim to the money or the stake because there's no written proof. That's a big point against the author's case.\n\nThen, the ethical aspect. The author did the work, but the friend didn't pay. However, taking matters into one's own hands by disrupting the company is a different issue. Even if the friend is in the wrong, the author's response of \"fucking his shit over\" is illegal and unethical. Harming someone else's property or business is a crime, regardless of the reason. So ethically, the author is crossing a line here.\n\nAlso, the author has access to the domain and hosting because they set it up. But does that mean they have the right to dismantle it? No. Even if the friend didn't pay, the author's legal ownership of the domain and code doesn't give them the right to sabotage the business. They could legally pursue payment through a lawsuit, but not resort to vandalism or sabotage.\n\nThe friend's actions were definitely wrong by not honoring the agreement, but the author's proposed retaliation is also wrong. The author should seek legal remedies if possible, but taking down the website or disrupting the POS system would be illegal and could lead to criminal charges or civil liability.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is not in the right because their actions would be illegal and unethical, even if the friend was in the wrong for not paying. The correct course of action is to pursue legal avenues, not personal revenge.\n"
