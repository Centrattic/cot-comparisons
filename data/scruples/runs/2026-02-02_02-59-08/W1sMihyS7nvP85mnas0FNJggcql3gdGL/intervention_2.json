He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author of the \"What Would Be The Aftermath\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author helped a friend start a company by designing the website and POS system. They had a verbal agreement for $2000 and 5% equity. The friend ghosted them, didn't pay, and the company became successful. Now the author is considering disrupting the company.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. The agreement was verbal. In many places, verbal agreements can be legally binding but are harder to enforce. Especially for equity, there might be specific requirements, like being in writing. The author might not have a strong legal claim here since there's no written contract. So if they take action, they might face legal consequences themselves.\n\nThen there's the ethical side. The author did the work and wasn't paid, which is unfair. But retaliating by disrupting the friend's business could be considered unethical or even illegal. Even if the friend broke the agreement, the author's response could be seen as harmful and not the right way to handle it. They should probably pursue legal action or try to resolve it through proper channels instead of taking matters into their own hands.\n\nAlso, the author still has access to the domain and hosting because they were in their name. If they take down the site or mess with the POS system, they could be committing a crime like cybercrime or sabotage. The friend might have a case against them for breach of contract or other issues if the author was supposed to maintain the systems.\n\nThe author's motivation is understandable\u2014they were promised payment and equity and were ignored. But the way they're planning to handle it is aggressive and could lead to more problems. They might end up liable for damages if their actions cause harm to the company.\n\nAnother point: the author mentions that the current systems aren't much of their original design anymore, but some code remains. If the author holds onto the domain and hosting, maybe they have a legitimate reason to ask for compensation, but using that to disrupt the business is a different matter. They should consult a lawyer to explore their options legally.\n\nIn summary, even though the friend wronged the author, the author's plan to disrupt the company is likely illegal and ethically questionable. So the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
