He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for considering to disrupt their friend's successful company. The situation started a few years ago when the friend asked the author to build a website and POS system. They had a verbal agreement for $2000 and a 5% stake. The author worked on it, but after the project, the friend ghosted them. Now, the friend is a millionaire, and the author is thinking of taking action to get their money and stake.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. The agreement was verbal, which might not hold up in court unless there's evidence of a contract. In many jurisdictions, verbal agreements can be binding, but proving the terms (like the 5% stake) could be tough. The author still has control over the domain and hosting, which might be a point in their favor, but using that to disrupt the company could lead to legal trouble. Also, the current POS system and website are still using the author's code without payment, so there's a possible intellectual property issue here.\n\nEthically, the friend broke the agreement by not paying and cutting off communication. The author might feel wronged, but seeking revenge by disrupting the business could be seen as overstepping. Even if the author has legal rights, taking action might be considered unethical because it could harm innocent people or the business beyond what's necessary for justice. Additionally, the author has already been stewing in their emotions for years, which might cloud their judgment. \n\nAnother angle: the friend's actions (ghosting, not paying) were definitely wrong. But the author now has the power to cause damage, which could be seen as taking matters into their own hands. Legal action would be the proper route, but if that's not feasible, does that justify self-help? It's a gray area. However, the author's response of wanting to \"completely fuck his shit\" seems more like revenge than seeking compensation, which could make them morally wrong even if they have a case.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author might have a legitimate grievance, but their intended action is retaliatory and could cause unnecessary harm. Therefore, they might be in the wrong for considering such drastic action instead of pursuing legal remedies.\n"
