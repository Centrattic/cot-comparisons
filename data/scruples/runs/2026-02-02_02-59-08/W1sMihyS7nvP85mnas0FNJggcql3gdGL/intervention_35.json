He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. So the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a friend who started a company and asked the author (the programmer) to design the website and POS system. They had a verbal agreement of $2000 plus 5% stake. The author worked on it for two weeks initially, then six more weeks for tweaks. The friend ghosted them after that. Now, years later, the friend is successful and the author is considering disrupting the company to get their money and stake.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. Verbal agreements can be tricky. In many jurisdictions, contracts for services over a certain amount need to be in writing to be enforceable. Since the stake is 5% of a multi-million dollar company, that could be a significant amount. But if there's no written agreement, the author might not have legal recourse. Even if there was an agreement, proving it in court without witnesses or written evidence would be difficult. So legally, the author might not have a strong case.\n\nThen there's the ethical angle. The author did the work and wasn't paid, which is unfair. They were ghosted, which is hurtful. But seeking revenge by disrupting the company could be seen as taking matters into their own hands. The author still has control over the domain and hosting, and some of the code. If they shut down the website or mess with the POS system, that could cause a lot of harm to the friend's business. However, the friend didn't follow through on the agreement, which is a breach of trust.\n\nThe author's actions could be considered unethical because they're retaliating in a way that harms their friend, potentially causing financial loss. Even if the friend is at fault for not paying, the author's response is extreme. Instead of seeking legal action (which might not be feasible without proof), they're planning to sabotage the company. That's not a constructive resolution. The friend's actions were wrong, but the author's response is also morally questionable.\n\nAnother point: the author had access to the systems because they were set up under their name. Technically, they might still have legal ownership of those assets, depending on how the agreements were made. If they were never transferred, the author could have a claim. But again, without a written contract, it's uncertain. The designer was paid upfront, so maybe the friend expected that the programmer would also be paid, but the lack of written agreement is a problem.\n\nIn terms of the question, the user initially thought the author is in the wrong but wants confirmation. The key here is balancing the friend's breach of agreement against the author's potential sabotage. Legally, the author might be in a weak position. Ethically, sabotaging the company is harmful and not a proper way to resolve disputes. Even if the friend is at fault, the author's actions are not justified. So the answer would be that the author is in the wrong (A).\n"
