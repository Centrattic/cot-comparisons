He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a friend who started a company and hired the author to design their website and POS system. They had a verbal agreement where the author was to be paid $2000 plus 5% stake. The friend didn't pay, ghosted the author, and now the company is worth millions. The author is considering disrupting the company to get what they're owed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. Legally, verbal agreements can be tricky. Without a written contract, proving the terms might be difficult. If there's no written agreement, it's hard to enforce the payment or the stake. The author might have a hard time getting that money through legal means because there's no written proof. But maybe they can make a claim based on the work they did and the evidence they have, like code ownership and domain being in their name.\n\nEthically, the friend did break the verbal agreement by not paying and cutting off contact. The author worked hard, put other projects on hold, and the friend didn't even acknowledge their help. It's understandable that the author feels wronged. However, the author's plan to disrupt the friend's business could be seen as revenge rather than a legitimate way to get paid. Disrupting a company's operations is illegal and could lead to legal consequences. Even if the author has some rights to the code, using that to cause damage is not a legal approach.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that the friend hired a designer who was paid but not given a stake. The author was promised a stake, which the friend didn't follow through on. But again, without a written agreement, the friend might not be legally bound. The author's current approach of threatening to disrupt the business is illegal regardless of the circumstances. Even if the author has a valid claim, using sabotage is not the right way to handle it. They should pursue legal channels, like small claims court if possible, or seek mediation.\n\nSo, considering both legal and ethical angles, the author is in the wrong for planning to disrupt the company. While the friend's actions were unethical and possibly broke the verbal agreement, the author's response is not justified and is illegal. The right approach is to pursue legal remedies, not take matters into their own hands.\n"
