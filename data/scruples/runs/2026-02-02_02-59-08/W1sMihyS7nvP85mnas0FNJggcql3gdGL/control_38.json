He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong based on this situation. The scenario is about a friend who started a company and asked the author to design the website and POS system. They had a verbal agreement for $2000 and 5% stake. The author worked on it, but the friend ghosted them and didn't pay. Now the company is successful, and the author is considering disrupting it.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are the verbal agreement, the lack of payment, and the author's potential actions to disrupt the company. \n\nIn legal terms, verbal agreements can be binding but are harder to enforce. However, without a written contract, proving the terms (like the 5% stake) might be difficult. The author might argue they were promised payment and equity, but without evidence, it's a challenge. The friend not repaying could be considered a breach of contract, but again, proving that is tricky.\n\nEthically, the friend's actions are questionable. Ghosting and not paying someone who contributed significant work is unfair. However, the author's potential retaliation (disrupting the company) is also problematic. Even if they feel wronged, taking action to harm the company could lead to legal consequences like sabotage or theft, especially if the author still holds ownership of the domain and code.\n\nThe author might not have exclusive rights since they weren't paid to release them, but using the work in a way that disrupts the business could be illegal. The friend's actions of not paying are wrong, but the author's response could also be illegal. The question is whether the author's planned actions are justified.\n\nSo, considering both legal and ethical angles, the friend is in the wrong for not fulfilling the verbal agreement. However, the author's plan to disrupt the company, regardless of the situation, is likely illegal and unethical. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for planning to harm the company, even if the friend wronged them.\n"
