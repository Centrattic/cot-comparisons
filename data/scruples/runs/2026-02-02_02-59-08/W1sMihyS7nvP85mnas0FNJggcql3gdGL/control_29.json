He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Would I Be Terrible for...\" scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend who started a company and asked the author to design the website and POS system. There was a verbal agreement for $2000 plus 5% equity. The author did the work, but the friend ghosted them, didn't pay, and now the company is successful. The author is considering taking action to disrupt the company because they feel wronged.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. A verbal agreement can be legally binding but is harder to enforce. Since there's no written contract, proving the terms might be difficult. The author did the work, but without a formal contract, it's unclear if they can legally claim payment or equity. However, ethically, the friend broke the agreement, which is a breach of trust.\n\nThe author is contemplating disrupting the company, which could involve actions like removing access to the domain or code. While the domain and hosting are in the author's name, using their work without compensation could be seen as unethical. But taking retaliatory actions might cross legal boundaries, especially if it affects the company's operations. Defamation or sabotage could lead to legal consequences for the author.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's frustration is understandable. They put in significant work without payment and were cut off. However, retaliating by disrupting the company could make them legally liable. The right course of action might be to seek legal advice to explore options like small claims court or negotiating a settlement. Taking matters into one's own hands through sabotage is risky and could lead to more problems.\n\nIn terms of morality, while the friend was wrong to not honor the agreement, the author's potential actions could be seen as excessive. There's a difference between seeking rightful compensation and causing harm. The author might have valid claims but should pursue legal avenues rather than destructive measures.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If they proceed with disrupting the company, they could be acting unethically and illegally, especially if there's no legal basis to support their actions. However, the initial agreement's validity is questionable without a contract. The answer likely leans towards the author being in the wrong if they disrupt the company, as it's not a justified legal or ethical response. Instead, they should seek proper legal recourse.\n"
