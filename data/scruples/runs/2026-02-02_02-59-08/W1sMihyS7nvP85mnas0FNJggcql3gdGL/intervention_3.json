He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the WIBTA (Would I Be Terrible for Asking?) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend starting a company and the author helping with the website and POS system in exchange for payment and a stake, but then being ghosted without payment.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The friend had a verbal agreement to pay $2000 and a 5% stake. The author did the work, but the friend didn't follow through. Now, the author is considering disrupting the friend's company because they haven't been paid. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for this potential action.\n\nVerbal agreements can be tricky. Legally, they can be binding, but proving them might be hard. However, in this case, there's a detailed account from the author. The friend has the company up and running successfully, using the author's work, and hasn't paid. The author still has control over the domain and hosting, which gives them some leverage.\n\nThe author's anger is understandable. They put in significant work, put other projects on hold, and were left without payment or communication. The friend's actions\u2014ghosting, deleting messages\u2014suggest bad faith. The designer was paid upfront, but the author wasn't. The friend's success now contrasts with the author's lack of compensation.\n\nHowever, the author is considering \"fucking his shit over,\" which implies sabotage. Even if the friend is at fault for not keeping the agreement, the author's response could be seen as revenge rather than seeking a fair resolution. Legally, sabotaging someone's company could lead to liability. Ethically, it's about whether the ends justify the means. The author might have valid claims for payment, but taking action to disrupt the company could be illegal and unethical, regardless of the friend's wrongdoing.\n\nThe author's argument that they still have control over the domain and code might give them legal standing to demand payment or compensation. However, the way they're considering acting\u2014sabotage\u2014is problematic. The right approach might be to pursue legal action to recover the payment and stake, but not to retaliate in a harmful way.\n\nSo, while the friend is clearly in the wrong for breaking the agreement, the author's potential sabotage could make them at fault for illegal activities. The answer hinges on the distinction between seeking legal recourse and taking revenge. The author's actions, if they proceed with sabotage, would be wrong regardless of the friend's mistakes.\n"
