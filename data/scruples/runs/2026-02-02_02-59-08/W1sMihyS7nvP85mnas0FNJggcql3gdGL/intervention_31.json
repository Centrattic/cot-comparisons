He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a past friend who started a company and asked the writer to design a website and POS system. There was a verbal agreement for $2000 and 5% stake, but the friend never paid and ghosted them. Now the company is worth millions, and the writer is considering disrupting it to get what's owed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. Verbal agreements can be tricky. In many jurisdictions, a verbal contract can be enforceable, but it's harder to prove without written documentation. The problem here is that there's no written agreement, making it difficult for the writer to claim their rights in court. Even though the writer has access to the domain and code, ownership might not be clear without legal paperwork. The POS system is still in use, but if the friend is using it without a license, the writer could have a case, but proving it would be tough.\n\nThen there's the ethical side. The friend ghosted and didn't pay, which is clearly wrong. The writer has been wronged, but seeking revenge by \"fucking his shit over\" is not a legal or ethical solution. Disrupting the company could lead to serious legal consequences for the writer. Even if the friend is in the wrong, taking matters into one's own hands is not the right approach. The writer should pursue legal action if possible, like sending a cease and desist letter or suing for breach of contract, but not sabotage.\n\nAlso, the writer's emotional response is understandable. Being ghosted and not receiving payment or acknowledgment is hurtful. However, the proposed action is extreme. It's important to separate personal hurt from legal rights. The writer might have valid claims, but the way they're handling it is problematic.\n\nConsidering all this, the author is in the wrong because their plan to disrupt the company is illegal and unethical, regardless of the friend's wrongdoing. The correct course of action would be to seek legal remedies rather than take revenge.\n"
