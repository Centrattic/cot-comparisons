He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Would I Be Terrible for...\" question is in the wrong. The scenario involves a friend who started a company and promised payment and a stake in exchange for designing a website and POS system. The author did the work but wasn't paid, and now wants to disrupt the friend's business.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. There was a verbal agreement, which is generally valid but hard to enforce without proof. The author did the work, but since there's no written contract, it's tough to prove the terms. The friend might argue that the verbal agreement isn't binding, especially if there's no evidence. The author still has control over the domain and hosting, which gives them technical control, but does that translate to legal ownership? If the code was created as a work-for-hire, then the friend might own it, but since payment was never made, that's unclear. The author's threat to disrupt the business could be seen as extortion or sabotage, which is illegal.\n\nEthically, the author feels wronged because they did the work and weren't compensated. However, taking revenge by damaging the business isn't the right approach. Even if the friend was in the wrong by not paying, the author's response could cause harm beyond just getting their money. Disrupting a multi-million-dollar company could lead to legal consequences, like lawsuits for damages or interference with business operations. The author's actions could be considered malicious, especially if it affects employees or customers.\n\nAlso, the author mentions having access to the systems. If they remove or alter the code, it's not just about their original agreement but also about current users and operations. The friend might have hired others to maintain the systems, and the author's interference could disrupt those efforts. Legally, the author might be liable for any downtime or losses incurred by the company.\n\nOn the other hand, the friend did benefit from the author's work without compensation, which is unfair. However, the proper recourse would be to pursue legal action through the courts, not to take matters into one's own hands. The author's plan to \"fuck his shit over\" is not a legal solution and could result in criminal charges or civil liability.\n\nSo, combining legal and ethical perspectives, the author is in the wrong for planning to disrupt the business. While the friend's actions were unethical, the author's response is not justified and would likely lead to further legal issues. The correct path would be to seek legal advice to pursue the unpaid compensation and any possible breach of contract, but not to retaliate with sabotage.\n"
