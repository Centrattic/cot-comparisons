He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"What Would I Be Termed As...\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend who started a company and asked the author to design the website and POS system. They had a verbal agreement for $2000 and 5% stake. The author worked on it, the friend ghosted, and now the author is considering disrupting the friend's company.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal perspective. Verbal agreements can be tricky. In many jurisdictions, verbal contracts are valid but hard to prove. Without written documentation, it's difficult to enforce the agreement. The author might not have a legal claim because there's no evidence beyond their word. However, the friend might have breached the contract by not paying, but proving that would be tough.\n\nEthically, the author did the work expecting compensation and a stake. The friend didn't follow through, which is unfair. But the author's response is to disrupt the company, which could be seen as revenge. Even if the friend wronged them, taking actions like sabotaging the company could cause significant harm beyond what they were owed. That might be ethically questionable because it could affect employees, customers, and the business's success, not just the friend.\n\nAlso, the author still has access to the domain and code. Legally, if the domain is in their name, they might have the right to manage it. But using that access to disrupt the company could be illegal, like hacking or intellectual property theft. Even if the code is their property, the friend might have a license to use it once paid. Since the author hasn't been paid, maybe the friend doesn't have that license, but it's murky.\n\nEmotionally, the author is hurt and seeking justice, but their actions could be seen as overreaching. The friend's behavior was wrong, but retaliation might not be the right approach. There might be other avenues, like sending a legal notice or trying to negotiate, instead of disrupting the company.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The author might have a point about being wronged, but their plan to disrupt the company is likely illegal and unethical. Therefore, they are in the wrong for considering such actions.\n"
