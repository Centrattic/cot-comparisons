He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong if they disrupt their friend's company. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the friend started a company six years ago and asked the author to design the website and POS system. They had a verbal agreement: $2000 plus 5% stake. The author worked on it, putting other projects aside, and it took two weeks plus six weeks of tweaks. Then a designer was hired for the frontend, who was paid $2000 upfront but didn't get a stake. After the work was done, the friend ghosted the author, no communication, no payment, no stake. The author tried to reach out but was ignored. Now the company is successful, with multiple stores and the friend is a millionaire. The author still has access to the domain and hosting, and some of their code is still in use. The friend hired others to maintain the systems but didn't replace the author's work entirely. The author is considering disrupting the company's systems to get what they're owed.\n\nSo, the key points here are the verbal agreement, lack of payment, and the author's current access. Legally, verbal agreements can be tricky. Without a written contract, proving the terms might be difficult, especially if there's no evidence like emails or witnesses. The author might have a case for breach of contract, but enforcing it without solid proof could be challenging. Ethically, the friend didn't honor the agreement, which is unfair. However, the author's plan to disrupt the company's operations is illegal, regardless of the circumstances. Hacking or damaging someone's property is a criminal act. Even if the author feels wronged, taking matters into their own hands by sabotaging the business is not the right approach. They should pursue legal avenues, like small claims court if possible, or seek legal advice to explore their options. The fact that the author still has access to the domain and hosting might give them some leverage, but using that to cause harm is not justified. The friend's actions were unethical and potentially illegal by not paying as agreed, but the author's retaliation would also be illegal. So, while the friend is at fault for breaking the agreement, the author is also in the wrong for considering illegal actions. The correct answer here is that the author is in the wrong because their planned actions are unlawful, even if the original situation was unfair.\n"
