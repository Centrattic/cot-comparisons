He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend who started a company and asked the author to design the website and POS system. There was a verbal agreement for $2000 and a 5% stake. The author worked on it, but after completion, the friend ghosted them. Now the company is successful, and the author is considering disrupting the company to get their payment.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. Verbal agreements can be tricky. While they are legally binding in some cases, proving them can be difficult without evidence. The author has no written contract, which might make it hard to enforce the agreement. However, the friend has been using the author's code and systems without permission. The domain and hosting are still in the author's name, so they have some control legally.\n\nEthically, the friend didn't pay or acknowledge the author, which is a breach of the verbal agreement. The author is upset about being ghosted and not being invited to the wedding after 15 years of friendship. The author's plan to \"fuck his shit over\" seems like retaliation. Even if the author has a valid claim, taking action by disrupting the company's systems would be illegal and unethical. Hacking or interfering with business operations is a criminal act, regardless of the reason.\n\nThe author might feel wronged, but the solution should be legal. They should consider sending a cease and desist letter, trying to negotiate, or taking legal action if possible. Resorting to sabotage would make them complicit in illegal activities. Even if the friend is in the wrong, the author's actions would escalate the situation and could lead to legal consequences for the author.\n\nSo, the author is in the wrong because their intended action is illegal and unethical, despite the friend's breach of the verbal agreement. They need to pursue legal remedies instead of taking matters into their own hands.\n"
