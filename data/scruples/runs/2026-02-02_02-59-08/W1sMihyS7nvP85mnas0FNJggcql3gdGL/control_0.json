He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"What Would I Be The Asshole For?\" scenario is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation carefully.\n\nFirst, the author helped their friend start a company by designing a website and POS system six years ago. They had a verbal agreement for $2000 plus 5% stake. The friend didn't pay and ghosted them. Now, the company is successful, and the author is considering disrupting it to get their money and stake.\n\nThe key points here are the verbal agreement, the lack of written contract, and the author's potential actions. Verbal agreements are generally hard to enforce legally. The author mentions having access to the domain and hosting because they're in their name, which might mean they have some control. However, using that to disrupt the company could be problematic.\n\nLegally, without a signed contract, it's tough to claim the 5% stake or the $2000. The friend ghosting is inconsiderate, but the author's threat to \"fuck his shit over\" might be illegal, like sabotaging systems or leaking code. Even if the author feels wronged, taking matters into their own hands could lead to legal repercussions, such as charges of theft or sabotage.\n\nEthically, while the friend's actions were unfair, the author's response crosses a line. Disrupting a business is a serious offense. The author should consider legal avenues, like small claims court if possible, or seeking mediation. Taking revenge through destructive actions is not justifiable, regardless of the situation.\n\nMoreover, the author still has access to the domain and code, but using that access to harm the business is not the right approach. They might have a case for the initial debt, but the method of enforcement is what's in question here. The answer hinges on both legal and ethical considerations\u2014without a contract, the author's claims are weak, and their actions could make them the real problem.\n"
