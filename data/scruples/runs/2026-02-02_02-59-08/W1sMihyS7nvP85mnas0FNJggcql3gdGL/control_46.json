He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So, the user is asking whether the person who wrote the Redit-style post is in the wrong. The situation is that they helped a friend start a company by designing the website and POS system, under a verbal agreement for $2000 and 5% stake. But after the work was done, the friend ghosted them, never paid, and the company became super successful. Now, the author is considering screwing over the friend's company to get what they believe is owed.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the laws about contracts. A verbal agreement can be legally binding, but proving it might be hard. Since there's no written contract, the author would have to prove that the agreement existed. However, the friend denies it, and there's no evidence. So legally, the author might not have a strong case. But maybe in some jurisdictions, it's different. But generally, verbal contracts are possible but difficult to enforce without proof.\n\nThen there's the ethical aspect. The author did the work, expecting payment and a stake. The friend didn't pay and cut off contact. The author feels wronged. But is retaliating by disrupting the company ethical? Even if they have a point about being owed money, taking down the company could be seen as revenge, which is morally questionable. Also, the author still has control over the domain and code, which might give them some leverage. But using that control to harm the company could be illegal, like destroying property or interfering with business.\n\nAlso, the author mentions they weren't paid to release exclusive rights, so they might still own the code. That means they have rights to the intellectual property. If they remove access or change the code, it's their legal right to do so as the owner. But does that mean it's right? It might be legally justified, but ethically, it's still revenge. Also, if they did this, it could lead to legal action from the friend, even if the author has a valid claim. The friend might sue for damages caused by the disruption, complicating things.\n\nAnother angle: the author hasn't pursued legal action yet. Maybe they could try to negotiate or go to small claims court if possible. Disrupting the business could be considered a civil tort, causing harm, which could result in more legal consequences. Even if they have a claim for unpaid services, intentionally harming the company might not be the best approach.\n\nSo, putting it all together: Legally, the author might have a case for the unpaid services if they can prove the verbal agreement, but the friend's lack of response makes it hard. Ethically, retaliating by disrupting the company is questionable, as it's an act of revenge and might have legal repercussions. The author might have leverage over the code and domain, but using it could backfire. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for planning to disrupt the company instead of seeking legal remedies.\n"
