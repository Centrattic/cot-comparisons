He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to work through this situation step by step. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering to disrupt their friend's company. Let me start by understanding the details given.\n\nSo, the author worked on a project for their friend's company several years ago. They had a verbal agreement where they were to receive $2000 and 5% of the company. The friend didn't pay and instead ghosted them. Now, the friend is successful with multiple stores and the author wants to take action by disrupting the company because they haven't been paid. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. The agreement was verbal, which can be tricky. In many jurisdictions, verbal contracts can be enforceable, but they're harder to prove. The author might have a case if they can demonstrate the existence of the agreement, but without written proof, it could be difficult.\n\nThen there's the ethical side. The friend is now using the author's work without payment, which seems unfair. But the author is considering illegal or unethical actions to disrupt the company, which could cause harm beyond just financial. They mention having access to the domain and code, so they might have the means to do something damaging. \n\nHowever, taking such actions could lead to legal consequences for the author. Even if the original agreement was breached, retaliating by disrupting the company might be considered sabotage or theft, which is illegal. The author could be held liable for damages if they take such steps. \n\nAlso, the relationship aspect is important. The friend cut off contact, which is hurtful, but that doesn't justify illegal actions. The author's frustration is understandable, but revenge through damaging the company is not the right approach. They might be in the wrong because their plan to disrupt the company is illegal regardless of the original dispute.\n\nOn the other hand, the friend is clearly in the wrong for not honoring the agreement and ghosting. But the question is about whether the author is in the wrong for their planned action. Since the author is considering illegal actions, even if the friend wronged them, the author would be at fault for committing those actions. \n\nSo, putting it all together: The author might have a valid grievance, but their proposed solution is illegal and unethical. Therefore, they would be in the wrong if they follow through with disrupting the company.\n"
