He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author helped a friend start their business by designing a website and POS system. There was a verbal agreement for $2000 and 5% equity. The friend didn't pay and ghosted the author, cutting off communication. Now the company is successful, and the author is considering disrupting the company to get payment.\n\nFirst, the legal aspect. Verbal agreements are tough to enforce, especially without written proof. The friend might not have intended to honor the 5% stake, so the author's claim might not hold up in court. The domain and hosting being in the author's name could give them some leverage, but using someone else's code without payment is a legal issue. However, the author's threat to disrupt the company is illegal and could lead to criminal charges if they actually do something harmful.\n\nEthically, the author's actions are questionable. While the friend might be in the wrong for not paying as agreed, the author's plan to sabotage the company is also wrong. Instead of disrupting the business, they should seek legal recourse, like sending a cease and desist or filing a lawsuit. Threatening to damage someone's property (even if it's their own code) is not the right approach.\n\nThe author's frustration is understandable, but taking matters into their own hands with harmful actions is not the solution. The friend's behavior was unethical, but that doesn't justify the author breaking the law to retaliate. The right course would be to pursue legal options to get what's owed, not to actively damage the company's operations.\n"
