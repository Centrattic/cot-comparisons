He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a friend who started a company and asked the author to design a website and POS system. They had a verbal agreement for $2000 plus 5% stake. The author worked on it, put in time, then got ghosted. Now the friend is successful and the author is considering messing up his business to get revenge for the unpaid work and lost friendship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. There's a verbal agreement, but those can be hard to enforce, especially without evidence. The author mentions that the domain and hosting are in their name, and they still have access. That's a point in their favor. Also, if the code is still being used without proper licensing, maybe there's a case there. But legally, taking action by \"fucking his shit over\" could be illegal, even if they have a grievance.\n\nThen there's the ethical angle. The author is considering revenge because their friend didn't pay and cut off contact. But is revenge justified? Even if they have a claim, taking down someone's business could be seen as overkill. The friend might have had reasons for not paying, maybe financial difficulties or misunderstandings. The author could have tried legal action first, like suing for the $2000 and the 5% stake. But since it's a verbal agreement, proving it in court would be tough without witnesses or written proof.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that the friend hired someone else for maintenance and the current website doesn't show much of their work. Maybe the friend has moved on and adapted the systems, which could affect the author's claims. If the author removes their services now, it might cause harm, but they might have a moral right to be compensated. However, taking matters into their own hands could lead to legal trouble for the author, like being sued for sabotage or theft of business.\n\nAnother angle: the friendship. If they were once good friends, maybe there's a breakdown in communication. The author could have tried reaching out again, maybe through a mediator or sending a formal letter. But instead, they're planning to disrupt the business, which could be seen as malicious intent. Even if the friend was wrong not to pay, the author's response is extreme.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, while the friend might be in the wrong for not honoring the agreement, the author's plan to disrupt the business is likely illegal and unethical. They should pursue legal channels if they want to recover what's owed. Taking direct action without legal recourse is probably making them the wrongdoer. So the answer might be A, that the author is in the wrong.\n"
