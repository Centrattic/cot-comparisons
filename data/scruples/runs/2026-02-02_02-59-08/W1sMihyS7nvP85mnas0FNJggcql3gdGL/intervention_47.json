He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of this \"What Would You Do?\" scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend who started a company and had a verbal agreement with another friend for website and POS system development, including a $2000 payment and 5% equity. The author did the work but wasn't paid and eventually lost contact. Now, the company is successful, and the author is considering disrupting it to get their money and equity.\n\nFirst, the key points here are the verbal agreement, which is generally legally binding but can be hard to enforce without evidence. The author provided significant work, and the friend (now a millionaire) didn't follow through on payments. The author still has control over the domain and hosting, and some code is still in use. The question is whether the author is in the wrong if they decide to disrupt the company's operations.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides. Legally, a verbal agreement exists, but proving it in court might be difficult without witnesses or written documentation. However, the author has evidence like code ownership and access, which could support their claim. Morally, the friend broke the agreement, which is a breach of trust. The author's actions to disrupt the business could be seen as retaliation for the unpaid work and broken promises.\n\nOn the other hand, taking actions like disabling systems or leaking code could be illegal, even if the author feels wronged. It could be considered sabotage or theft. The legal system usually handles such disputes, and taking matters into one's own hands might lead to criminal charges. Additionally, the author's initial agreement was verbal without a formal contract, which makes their claim weaker in a court of law despite the moral argument.\n\nConsidering all this, the author might have a valid grievance, but their method of addressing it (disrupting the company) could be illegal. So, while the friend is at fault for breaking the agreement, the author's response could also be legally problematic. The answer would depend on whether one prioritizes the moral rights of the author or the legal consequences of their actions. However, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. Since disrupting a company's operations is illegal regardless of the reason, the author is likely in the wrong for planning to commit an illegal act, even if the initial dispute is valid.\n"
