He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the person who wrote this (the author) is in the wrong for considering to disrupt their friend's company. \n\nFirst, looking at the situation: The author helped start a company by designing the website and point of sale system. There was a verbal agreement for $2000 plus 5% equity. The friend didn't pay and ghosted the author. Now the company is successful, and the author is thinking of taking action to disrupt the company to get their money and equity.\n\nSo, the main points here are the validity of the claim and the method of enforcement. \n\nVerbal agreements can be legally binding but are harder to enforce. Since there's no written contract, proving the terms might be difficult. The friend might argue there was never a valid agreement. The author might have a case if they can prove the verbal agreement, but without evidence, it's risky.\n\nThen, the author is considering \"fucking his shit over,\" which sounds like damaging the company's systems. That's definitely illegal. Hacking into systems, disrupting operations, or taking down websites would be criminal acts. Even if the author feels wronged, taking such actions would be illegal and unethical, regardless of the situation. \n\nThe author might have a moral claim, but using illegal methods to enforce that claim makes them at fault. They could face legal consequences for their actions. Additionally, the friend might have a defense if he claims there was no formal agreement or that the author's work was done without payment terms.\n\nSo, even if the author's claim has some merit, their potential actions are wrong. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong if they proceed with disruptive actions.\n"
