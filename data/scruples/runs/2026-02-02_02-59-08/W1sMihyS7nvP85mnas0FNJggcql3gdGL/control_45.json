He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of this scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend who started a company and asked the author to design the website and POS system. They had a verbal agreement for payment and a 5% stake. The author worked on it but wasn't paid, and the friend ghosted them. Now the friend is successful, and the author is considering disrupting the company.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal aspects. Verbal agreements can be tricky. While they are legally binding in many places, enforcing them can be difficult without evidence. The author might have a case if they can prove the agreement existed, but without written proof, it's hard. Also, the domain and hosting being in the author's name might give them legal ownership of those assets, which could be a point in their favor.\n\nEthically, the friend broke the agreement and didn't follow through on the promised payment and stake. The author worked hard and then was ignored. The friend's actions seem deceitful. However, the author is considering retaliatory actions, like disrupting the company. Even if they have a legal claim, taking destructive actions could be considered wrong. They might have legal recourse like suing for the owed money and stake instead of harming the business.\n\nAlso, consider the principle of \"an eye for an eye.\" While the friend wronged the author, retaliating in the same way might not be the right approach. The author could be seen as taking the moral high ground by seeking justice through proper channels rather than revenge. \n\nOn the other hand, the friend did nothing wrong legally if there was no written contract. The author might be in the wrong if they take matters into their own hands without legal action first. Disrupting a business is a serious action and could lead to legal consequences for the author.\n\nSo, considering both legal and ethical angles, the author might not be in the wrong for seeking compensation, but their method of seeking it (disrupting the company) could be considered wrong. The answer likely depends on whether they pursue legal action or take direct, harmful actions.\n"
