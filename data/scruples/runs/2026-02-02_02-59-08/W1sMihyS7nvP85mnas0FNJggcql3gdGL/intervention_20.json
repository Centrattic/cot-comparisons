He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author helped a friend start a company by designing a website and a point of sale system. They had a verbal agreement for $2000 and a 5% stake. The friend didn't pay, ghosted the author, and now the company is worth millions with multiple stores. The author is considering messing up the systems they built because they feel wronged.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. Verbal agreements can be hard to enforce, especially if there's no written proof. Even though they had a gentleman's agreement, without documentation, proving the terms might be difficult. The author might not have a legal claim to the 5% stake or the $2000. But maybe there's some evidence, like messages or emails, that could help. However, the user didn't mention any of that, so maybe not.\n\nThen there's the ethical side. The author did the work, but the friend didn't follow through on the payment. The friend's actions of ghosting and not maintaining communication are definitely inconsiderate and unethical. But does that justify the author retaliating by disrupting the company? Retaliation can be problematic because it's not a legal solution and can cause harm beyond just the initial issue.\n\nThe author has access to the domain and web hosting, which they set up under their own name. That's a legal ownership point, so technically, they might have the right to control those. But if they take them down, it could be illegal, depending on the jurisdiction and the terms of the original agreement. Even if the friend didn't pay, the author's response could lead to legal trouble for them as well.\n\nEmotionally, the author is justified in feeling hurt and wronged. But acting out of revenge might not be the best approach. There are other ways to address this, like trying to negotiate again, sending a legal notice, or seeking mediation. However, the author might not want to confront the friend again, especially after being ghosted for so long.\n\nAnother angle: the friend might not have known how to handle the business side initially, hence the lack of invoices. Maybe the friend thought they would handle payments later but changed their mind. But that's speculative. The author's work was crucial to the company's success, so the friend's failure to honor the agreement is a breach of trust.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the friend is clearly in the wrong for not fulfilling the agreement and ghosting. But the author's plan to disrupt the company could be seen as taking justice into their own hands, which isn't advisable. Even if the author has a point, their actions could lead to further complications and might not resolve the issue legally or ethically.\n\nSo, while the friend is at fault, the author's retaliation could make them complicit in unethical behavior. The author isn't in the right for seeking revenge, even if the friend wronged them. The appropriate action would be to pursue legal means if possible, not to disrupt the company's operations. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for planning to disrupt the business.\n"
