He asked me to design his website and point of sale system. We had a gentlemen's agreement (ie. worth nothing) of payment. A verbal contract only us two knew of. I was to be paid $2,000 plus a stake in his company (5%). At the start, this was a home business, so he didn't know or have the tools to make invoices, PI's, etc.\n\nI wasn't a super experienced programmer at the time. I was fresh out of school for computer science. Despite that, I put all my other projects on hold and worked on his task. It took me 2 weeks to get everything functional as he wanted, and a further 6 weeks for minute tweaks he mentioned after the fact. He hired a designer to assist me, so I did the backend and the designer did the frontend. AFAIK, the designer was not given a stake in the company but was paid $2000 up front.\n\nOnce I finished my work, I was ghosted. Didn't reply to texts or calls or Facebook messages. We never hung out anymore. We didn't do anything. He'd write on my wall \"happy birthday\" or the errant post like or things to that effect but nothing of more substance. Any time I posted on his wall to ask what's what, it was deleted. At this point I didn't care about the money or anything, I just wanted my friend back.\n\nThis leads to today. Years later. Still have not received payment or any acknowledgment of my existence beyond the aforementioned Facebook pleasantries. My friend is retired now. He owns two houses. His company opened up six store locations and the success train is not slowing. He's a millionaire. I've stewed in my emotions and gave up until a few days ago he posted wedding photos. I wasn't invited, hell I didn't even know he was getting married. We've been friends for 15 years, good friends at that, and now I know it's over.\n\nHe's hired someone else to maintain my work over the years. Not much of what the designer and I made is evident in his current website. Credentials do, however, I still have access to these things. The domain is in my name, the webhost is in my name. A lot of the code is still my property as I wasn't paid to release exclusive license for use to my friend and looking at some source files, a lot of my code is still being used. My POS system is still being used in his stores.\n\nWIBTA if I completely fucked his shit over $2000 and potentially millions in options?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend starting a company and hiring the author to design the website and POS system. They had a verbal agreement for $2000 plus 5% equity. The author worked for weeks, but after the project was done, the friend ghosted them. Now, the company is successful, and the author is considering disrupting it to get their money and equity.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. Verbal agreements can be tricky. While they are legally binding in some cases, proving the terms might be difficult without a written contract. The author hasn't received payment, but without a documented agreement, enforcing the claim could be hard. However, the author still holds the domain and hosting under their name, which might give them some legal standing regarding ownership of the code. If the code is still being used without proper licensing, that could be a point in the author's favor.\n\nEthically, the friend broke the verbal agreement and ghosted, which is wrong. But the author's retaliation by \"fucking his shit over\" is also unethical and possibly illegal. Disrupting a business would likely be considered malicious and could lead to legal consequences for the author. Even if the friend is in the wrong, the author shouldn't take matters into their own hands that way.\n\nEmotionally, the author feels wronged and betrayed, which is understandable. But using that as justification for sabotage isn't right. The appropriate course of action would be to seek legal advice to pursue the unpaid compensation and equity, rather than engaging in destructive behavior.\n\nIn terms of friendship, the relationship seems broken, but that doesn't justify harmful actions. The author might have valid claims, but they should address them through proper channels. Disrupting the business could backfire and lead to further conflict or legal issues.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is in the wrong for planning to sabotage the friend's company. Even though the friend didn't fulfill the agreement, the author's response crosses the line into illegality and unethical behavior. The correct approach would be to pursue legal remedies, not personal retaliation.\n"
