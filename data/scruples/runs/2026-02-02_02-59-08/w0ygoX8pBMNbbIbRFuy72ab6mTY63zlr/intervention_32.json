I bought my dog for $2500 so this woman might faced  felony of the fifth degree, prison term of 6-12 months, and a fine no more than $2500. This is relevant at the end.\n\nThe incident happened three months ago. I was walking my dog and it was a beautiful day. I live in a really nice neighborhood. Most of the people living in the neighborhood are young adult that really health conscious, there are a lot of restaurant offering vegan menu and there is even a vegan bistro that we love.\n\nWhen I was walking my dog in the square, I saw DxE (direct action everywhere) protesting near the park. I thought it was good, I am not a vegan but I limit my meat consumption for ethical and health reason. I was just walking my puppy. A girl, let's call her Karen, ask me \"hey beautiful pup, what kind is that\" so I said it's Golden Retriever, it just that he has a really light color. I did not know she was part of the protest, she didn't have any sign and just dress normally.\n\nKaren next response was \"oh so it's pure breed, do you know that millions of dog got gassed every year in shelter?\" at this point I felt uncomfortable and started to just walk away but she kept following me. So I told her that I know that fact but choose going through breeder route because I want specific traits in my dog and I use a reputable breeder. I was keep walking and she said that I was being selfish for going through breeder route, she asked me what did I gave to my dog, I told her none of her business and please leave me alone. Karen started to lose her shit and called me the most selfish person she ever met that I am rude and she started called me name, I was just keep walking away from her, at this point she yelled at me that I am slaving my puppy and then she grabbed the leash, pushed me and tried to run with my puppy. Worf losing it and he wanted to come to me so I was able to take back the leash, and my neighbor helped me, he saw and hear everything. It happened so quick.\n\nWe went to police car near the location, told them what happened, and Karen was so stupid she kept following me and screaming on how I enslave my puppy. I explained everything and the police arrested Karen. The police revoke the DxE protestor permit because Karen was part of them and I felt bad because the other protestor were just doing their thing and I believe in free speech. When I reported Karen, I was scared but she might actually go to Jail, maybe she was so passionate but I don't think she deserved to be in jail, idk, I am a bit torn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who reported the vegan activist is in the wrong. The situation involves a confrontation during a protest where the activist tried to take the person's dog. \n\nFirst, the woman, Karen, approached the person while they were walking their dog. She started a conversation but then accused the person of being selfish for getting a purebred dog and pushed them. The person called the police, leading to Karen's arrest.\n\nThe key points here are: did the person have a right to report Karen? Was Karen's action criminal? The police arrested Karen for attempting to take the dog, which could be considered assault or theft. The person acted in self-defense when trying to protect their dog. They had a witness, the neighbor, which supports their account. \n\nHowever, the person might be seen as escalating the situation by involving the police. But since Karen was a protestor and part of a group, maybe the person was justified in protecting themselves and their property (the dog). The protestor's actions crossed into aggression, so reporting her could be necessary. \n\nThe person also mentions feeling conflicted about the arrest affecting the protest. However, the individual's right to personal safety and property might outweigh the protest's free speech aspect here. So, the person isn't in the wrong because they responded to an actual threat and used available legal channels to protect themselves. The answer is B.\n"
