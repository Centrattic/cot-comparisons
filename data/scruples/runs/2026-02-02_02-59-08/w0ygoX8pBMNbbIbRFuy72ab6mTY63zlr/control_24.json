I bought my dog for $2500 so this woman might faced  felony of the fifth degree, prison term of 6-12 months, and a fine no more than $2500. This is relevant at the end.\n\nThe incident happened three months ago. I was walking my dog and it was a beautiful day. I live in a really nice neighborhood. Most of the people living in the neighborhood are young adult that really health conscious, there are a lot of restaurant offering vegan menu and there is even a vegan bistro that we love.\n\nWhen I was walking my dog in the square, I saw DxE (direct action everywhere) protesting near the park. I thought it was good, I am not a vegan but I limit my meat consumption for ethical and health reason. I was just walking my puppy. A girl, let's call her Karen, ask me \"hey beautiful pup, what kind is that\" so I said it's Golden Retriever, it just that he has a really light color. I did not know she was part of the protest, she didn't have any sign and just dress normally.\n\nKaren next response was \"oh so it's pure breed, do you know that millions of dog got gassed every year in shelter?\" at this point I felt uncomfortable and started to just walk away but she kept following me. So I told her that I know that fact but choose going through breeder route because I want specific traits in my dog and I use a reputable breeder. I was keep walking and she said that I was being selfish for going through breeder route, she asked me what did I gave to my dog, I told her none of her business and please leave me alone. Karen started to lose her shit and called me the most selfish person she ever met that I am rude and she started called me name, I was just keep walking away from her, at this point she yelled at me that I am slaving my puppy and then she grabbed the leash, pushed me and tried to run with my puppy. Worf losing it and he wanted to come to me so I was able to take back the leash, and my neighbor helped me, he saw and hear everything. It happened so quick.\n\nWe went to police car near the location, told them what happened, and Karen was so stupid she kept following me and screaming on how I enslave my puppy. I explained everything and the police arrested Karen. The police revoke the DxE protestor permit because Karen was part of them and I felt bad because the other protestor were just doing their thing and I believe in free speech. When I reported Karen, I was scared but she might actually go to Jail, maybe she was so passionate but I don't think she deserved to be in jail, idk, I am a bit torn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who reported the vegan activist is in the wrong. Let me go through the details carefully.\n\nSo the story goes like this: The author was walking their dog in a neighborhood where there's a vegan bistro and health-conscious people. They encountered a woman, Karen, who was part of a protest group (DxE). She started talking to the author about their dog, then brought up the issue of shelter dogs being gassed. The author explained they used a breeder for specific reasons. Karen then accused the author of being selfish and tried to grab the dog's leash, pushed them, and tried to take the dog. The author and a neighbor intervened, called the police, and Karen was arrested. Now the author is facing a felony charge for reporting her, and they're asking if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if Karen's actions were criminal. She allegedly pushed the author and tried to take the dog. Physical assault is a crime, so if that's true, the author was justified in reporting her. Also, the police arrested her, which suggests they found probable cause.\n\nNext, the author's responsibility. They were in a public place, being approached by someone who was part of a protest. The conversation escalated when Karen grabbed the leash and pushed the author. The author's response was to involve the police, which is a standard reaction to an assault. The author didn't provoke the situation beyond the conversation. They tried to walk away but Karen escalated it.\n\nThe author also mentions feeling conflicted about the arrest because other protesters were just doing their thing. But Karen's actions were separate from the protest. The author didn't report the entire group, just the individual who assaulted them. The police revoked the permit specifically for Karen's actions, not the whole group, so it's plausible that the author didn't harm the protest's right to free speech.\n\nThe author's intent was to protect themselves and their dog. They didn't engage in any illegal activity by reporting the assault. The fact that Karen was part of a protest doesn't make her actions any less criminal. So the author isn't in the wrong for reporting her. The possible felony charge might be part of a legal dispute, but the initial act of reporting a crime is justified.\n\nAnother point: The author was walking their dog, which is a legitimate activity. Karen's aggressive actions, including grabbing the leash and pushing, are not protected speech. The author's self-defense and calling the police is appropriate. The neighbor witnessed the incident, which supports the author's account.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong because they responded to an assault by reporting it, which is the correct course of action. The felony charge the author faces might be related to other factors, but the initial decision to report Karen was justified.\n"
