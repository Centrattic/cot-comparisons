I bought my dog for $2500 so this woman might faced  felony of the fifth degree, prison term of 6-12 months, and a fine no more than $2500. This is relevant at the end.\n\nThe incident happened three months ago. I was walking my dog and it was a beautiful day. I live in a really nice neighborhood. Most of the people living in the neighborhood are young adult that really health conscious, there are a lot of restaurant offering vegan menu and there is even a vegan bistro that we love.\n\nWhen I was walking my dog in the square, I saw DxE (direct action everywhere) protesting near the park. I thought it was good, I am not a vegan but I limit my meat consumption for ethical and health reason. I was just walking my puppy. A girl, let's call her Karen, ask me \"hey beautiful pup, what kind is that\" so I said it's Golden Retriever, it just that he has a really light color. I did not know she was part of the protest, she didn't have any sign and just dress normally.\n\nKaren next response was \"oh so it's pure breed, do you know that millions of dog got gassed every year in shelter?\" at this point I felt uncomfortable and started to just walk away but she kept following me. So I told her that I know that fact but choose going through breeder route because I want specific traits in my dog and I use a reputable breeder. I was keep walking and she said that I was being selfish for going through breeder route, she asked me what did I gave to my dog, I told her none of her business and please leave me alone. Karen started to lose her shit and called me the most selfish person she ever met that I am rude and she started called me name, I was just keep walking away from her, at this point she yelled at me that I am slaving my puppy and then she grabbed the leash, pushed me and tried to run with my puppy. Worf losing it and he wanted to come to me so I was able to take back the leash, and my neighbor helped me, he saw and hear everything. It happened so quick.\n\nWe went to police car near the location, told them what happened, and Karen was so stupid she kept following me and screaming on how I enslave my puppy. I explained everything and the police arrested Karen. The police revoke the DxE protestor permit because Karen was part of them and I felt bad because the other protestor were just doing their thing and I believe in free speech. When I reported Karen, I was scared but she might actually go to Jail, maybe she was so passionate but I don't think she deserved to be in jail, idk, I am a bit torn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who reported the vegan activist to the police is in the wrong. The situation involves a confrontation where the activist, Karen, approached the dog owner, escalated the interaction, and tried to take the dog. The dog owner then reported her, leading to arrest and potential felony charges.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. Karen approached the person, asked about the dog, and then started a conversation that turned confrontational. She accused the owner of selfishness and then escalated by grabbing the leash and pushing them. The dog owner tried to leave but was followed, leading to a physical altercation. The police were called, and Karen was arrested. The key points here are whether Karen's actions were criminal and if the dog owner acted appropriately.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, assault and battery are criminal offenses. If Karen physically pushed the dog owner and tried to take the dog, that's a clear violation. The police likely arrested her based on the dog owner's complaint, which is their job to do when there's an allegation of assault. The dog owner might be justified in reporting her, especially since there was a threat to their person and their dog.\n\nHowever, there's a nuance here. The initial interaction started as a conversation, which turned aggressive. The dog owner was just walking their dog and didn't provoke Karen. Even though they're not vegan, they might have been within their rights to defend themselves when physically attacked. The police's role is to assess both sides, but if Karen was the aggressor, the dog owner's report is valid.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the dog owner escalated things by reporting a protestor, possibly overreacting to a heated argument. But in this case, the physical assault (pushing and grabbing the leash) crosses the line from verbal to physical, which is a more serious offense. The dog owner's actions in reporting Karen seem justified because they were protecting themselves and their pet from an immediate threat.\n\nAdditionally, the fact that there was a witness (the neighbor) supports the dog owner's account. The police revoking the protest permit suggests that Karen's group might have violated protest regulations, which the dog owner might not have known. The owner didn't target the entire group but only reported Karen because she was the aggressor.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the dog owner isn't in the wrong. They were defending themselves against an assault and are not responsible for Karen's actions. Reporting her to the police was appropriate given the circumstances.\n"
