I bought my dog for $2500 so this woman might faced  felony of the fifth degree, prison term of 6-12 months, and a fine no more than $2500. This is relevant at the end.\n\nThe incident happened three months ago. I was walking my dog and it was a beautiful day. I live in a really nice neighborhood. Most of the people living in the neighborhood are young adult that really health conscious, there are a lot of restaurant offering vegan menu and there is even a vegan bistro that we love.\n\nWhen I was walking my dog in the square, I saw DxE (direct action everywhere) protesting near the park. I thought it was good, I am not a vegan but I limit my meat consumption for ethical and health reason. I was just walking my puppy. A girl, let's call her Karen, ask me \"hey beautiful pup, what kind is that\" so I said it's Golden Retriever, it just that he has a really light color. I did not know she was part of the protest, she didn't have any sign and just dress normally.\n\nKaren next response was \"oh so it's pure breed, do you know that millions of dog got gassed every year in shelter?\" at this point I felt uncomfortable and started to just walk away but she kept following me. So I told her that I know that fact but choose going through breeder route because I want specific traits in my dog and I use a reputable breeder. I was keep walking and she said that I was being selfish for going through breeder route, she asked me what did I gave to my dog, I told her none of her business and please leave me alone. Karen started to lose her shit and called me the most selfish person she ever met that I am rude and she started called me name, I was just keep walking away from her, at this point she yelled at me that I am slaving my puppy and then she grabbed the leash, pushed me and tried to run with my puppy. Worf losing it and he wanted to come to me so I was able to take back the leash, and my neighbor helped me, he saw and hear everything. It happened so quick.\n\nWe went to police car near the location, told them what happened, and Karen was so stupid she kept following me and screaming on how I enslave my puppy. I explained everything and the police arrested Karen. The police revoke the DxE protestor permit because Karen was part of them and I felt bad because the other protestor were just doing their thing and I believe in free speech. When I reported Karen, I was scared but she might actually go to Jail, maybe she was so passionate but I don't think she deserved to be in jail, idk, I am a bit torn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for reporting a vegan activist to the police, leading to her arrest and a potential felony charge. The situation involves a confrontation at a park where the activist, Karen, gets into an argument with the author about dog breeding, then physically grabs the dog's leash.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. The author was walking their dog when Karen approached. The conversation starts friendly but turns into an argument when Karen criticizes the breeder route. Karen then allegedly tries to grab the dog's leash, pushes the author, and tries to take the dog. The author and a neighbor report this to the police, and Karen is arrested. The author is now facing charges as a result of reporting her.\n\nNow, determining if the author is in the wrong. From the story, the author claims they were acting in self-defense and protecting their dog. They didn't know Karen was part of the protest initially. The key here is whether Karen's actions constituted a crime. If she physically assaulted or attempted to take the dog, then the author reporting her is justified. However, if Karen's actions were within the bounds of free speech or protest, then the author might be overreacting.\n\nBut wait, the police arrested Karen and revoked the protest permit. That suggests that the authorities saw her actions as criminal, possibly disorderly conduct, assault, or interfering with a citizen's property. If the police agreed that Karen's actions were unlawful, then the author's report was appropriate. The author also mentions that they felt bad about the other protesters, indicating they respect free speech, but Karen's actions crossed a line into physical confrontation.\n\nAnother angle: Did the author provoke the situation? The user says they were approached by Karen, who started the conversation. The argument escalated when Karen accused the author of selfishness, leading to the physical altercation. The author tried to walk away but Karen followed and grabbed the leash. So, the author might not be at fault for not starting the conflict.\n\nHowever, the author might be in the wrong if they overreacted to Karen's words. Words alone aren't a crime unless they incite imminent lawless action. But when Karen tried to grab the dog and pushed the author, that's a physical act that can be reported as assault. The presence of a neighbor corroborates the account, which strengthens the author's case.\n\nAlso, the author is facing a felony charge. Why? The user mentions that buying the dog for $2500 is relevant. If the dog was stolen or the breeder wasn't reputable, maybe there's an issue. But the author claims the breeder is reputable. If the dog is legally theirs, then Karen's attempt to take it is theft. The police would take that seriously.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's actions were in self-defense and protecting their property (the dog). Reporting a crime that occurred is their right. Unless there's evidence that the author provoked the situation or lied to the police, they aren't in the wrong. The key here is that Karen's actions were the criminal element, not the author's report.\n"
