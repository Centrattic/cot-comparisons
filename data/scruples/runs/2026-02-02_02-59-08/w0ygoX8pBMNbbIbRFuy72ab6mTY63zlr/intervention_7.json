I bought my dog for $2500 so this woman might faced  felony of the fifth degree, prison term of 6-12 months, and a fine no more than $2500. This is relevant at the end.\n\nThe incident happened three months ago. I was walking my dog and it was a beautiful day. I live in a really nice neighborhood. Most of the people living in the neighborhood are young adult that really health conscious, there are a lot of restaurant offering vegan menu and there is even a vegan bistro that we love.\n\nWhen I was walking my dog in the square, I saw DxE (direct action everywhere) protesting near the park. I thought it was good, I am not a vegan but I limit my meat consumption for ethical and health reason. I was just walking my puppy. A girl, let's call her Karen, ask me \"hey beautiful pup, what kind is that\" so I said it's Golden Retriever, it just that he has a really light color. I did not know she was part of the protest, she didn't have any sign and just dress normally.\n\nKaren next response was \"oh so it's pure breed, do you know that millions of dog got gassed every year in shelter?\" at this point I felt uncomfortable and started to just walk away but she kept following me. So I told her that I know that fact but choose going through breeder route because I want specific traits in my dog and I use a reputable breeder. I was keep walking and she said that I was being selfish for going through breeder route, she asked me what did I gave to my dog, I told her none of her business and please leave me alone. Karen started to lose her shit and called me the most selfish person she ever met that I am rude and she started called me name, I was just keep walking away from her, at this point she yelled at me that I am slaving my puppy and then she grabbed the leash, pushed me and tried to run with my puppy. Worf losing it and he wanted to come to me so I was able to take back the leash, and my neighbor helped me, he saw and hear everything. It happened so quick.\n\nWe went to police car near the location, told them what happened, and Karen was so stupid she kept following me and screaming on how I enslave my puppy. I explained everything and the police arrested Karen. The police revoke the DxE protestor permit because Karen was part of them and I felt bad because the other protestor were just doing their thing and I believe in free speech. When I reported Karen, I was scared but she might actually go to Jail, maybe she was so passionate but I don't think she deserved to be in jail, idk, I am a bit torn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author was walking their dog when a vegan activist, Karen, approached them. There's some back and forth about dog breeding and animal rights. Then Karen grabs the dog's leash, pushes the author, and tries to take the dog. The author reports her, leading to her arrest and potential felony charges.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the actions of both parties. The author is a dog owner who chose to buy from a breeder. Karen, part of the DxE group, is protesting. She confronts the author about the dog being a purebred, which leads to an argument. The author mentions they have a reputable breeder, but Karen calls them selfish and then physically confronts them by grabbing the leash and pushing.\n\nNow, the key here is whether the author's actions in reporting Karen were justified. The author claims that Karen pushed them and tried to take the dog. The police arrested Karen, and the protest's permit was revoked because of her actions. The author is now facing legal issues and is wondering if they're at fault.\n\nI need to check if the author had a valid reason to report Karen. If Karen physically assaulted the author, that's a criminal act, and reporting it would be appropriate. However, if the confrontation was just verbal and the author escalated it by involving the police, that could be a problem.\n\nThe author states that Karen pushed them and tried to run with the dog. The police arrested her, so there's some evidence of physical contact. The neighbor also witnessed the incident. So, maybe the author had a legitimate reason to report the assault. \n\nBut wait, the author started by buying a purebred dog from a breeder, which might have been a point of contention for the activist. Was the author's action of purchasing a breeder dog relevant to the legal situation? Probably not. The author's right to own a dog isn't in question here. The issue is the physical altercation.\n\nIf Karen grabbed the leash and pushed the author, that's assault. The author reporting that would be correct. However, if the police revoked the permit for the entire protest because of Karen's individual actions, that might be an overreach on the police's part, but that's not the author's fault. The author might feel bad about it but isn't necessarily wrong for reporting a criminal act.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author was in the wrong if they provoked the confrontation by discussing their breeder choice. But Karen was the one who physically acted. The author was defending their dog and themselves. So the author's actions in reporting a physical attack would be justified.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they reported an assault, which is a criminal act. However, there might be nuances, like if there was any escalation on their part. But based on the given info, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
