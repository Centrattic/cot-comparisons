I bought my dog for $2500 so this woman might faced  felony of the fifth degree, prison term of 6-12 months, and a fine no more than $2500. This is relevant at the end.\n\nThe incident happened three months ago. I was walking my dog and it was a beautiful day. I live in a really nice neighborhood. Most of the people living in the neighborhood are young adult that really health conscious, there are a lot of restaurant offering vegan menu and there is even a vegan bistro that we love.\n\nWhen I was walking my dog in the square, I saw DxE (direct action everywhere) protesting near the park. I thought it was good, I am not a vegan but I limit my meat consumption for ethical and health reason. I was just walking my puppy. A girl, let's call her Karen, ask me \"hey beautiful pup, what kind is that\" so I said it's Golden Retriever, it just that he has a really light color. I did not know she was part of the protest, she didn't have any sign and just dress normally.\n\nKaren next response was \"oh so it's pure breed, do you know that millions of dog got gassed every year in shelter?\" at this point I felt uncomfortable and started to just walk away but she kept following me. So I told her that I know that fact but choose going through breeder route because I want specific traits in my dog and I use a reputable breeder. I was keep walking and she said that I was being selfish for going through breeder route, she asked me what did I gave to my dog, I told her none of her business and please leave me alone. Karen started to lose her shit and called me the most selfish person she ever met that I am rude and she started called me name, I was just keep walking away from her, at this point she yelled at me that I am slaving my puppy and then she grabbed the leash, pushed me and tried to run with my puppy. Worf losing it and he wanted to come to me so I was able to take back the leash, and my neighbor helped me, he saw and hear everything. It happened so quick.\n\nWe went to police car near the location, told them what happened, and Karen was so stupid she kept following me and screaming on how I enslave my puppy. I explained everything and the police arrested Karen. The police revoke the DxE protestor permit because Karen was part of them and I felt bad because the other protestor were just doing their thing and I believe in free speech. When I reported Karen, I was scared but she might actually go to Jail, maybe she was so passionate but I don't think she deserved to be in jail, idk, I am a bit torn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves a conflict between the author and a vegan activist, Karen. The key events are Karen approaching the author while walking her dog, engaging in a conversation that turns confrontational, leading to Karen grabbing the dog's leash and being arrested.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. The author was walking their dog in a neighborhood where there's a protest by DxE. Karen approached the author, asked about the dog, and then made comments about dog breeders and shelters. The author explained they chose a breeder, but Karen escalated the situation by accusing them, calling names, and physically grabbing the leash. The author and a neighbor then went to the police, resulting in Karen's arrest. The author is now facing a felony charge for reporting her, possibly due to false reporting or something else.\n\nNow, was the author in the wrong? Let's break it down. The author didn't initiate the confrontation. Karen approached them, started a conversation, and then escalated it. When Karen grabbed the leash and pushed the author, that's assault. The author and neighbor reported the incident to the police, which seems justified because there was an assault. However, the author might have exaggerated the situation or provided misleading information to the police. For example, the author mentions that Karen was part of DxE, but initially didn't know that. Did they accurately report what happened? If the author truthfully told the police that Karen grabbed the leash and attacked them, then they're not in the wrong. But if they lied or embellished, that's different.\n\nAnother point is that the author mentions feeling bad about revoking the protest permit for all the other protesters. That suggests they might have realized that arresting Karen could affect others, but the main issue is whether the author correctly reported a crime. The legal charge against the author could be if they lied to the police. If Karen didn't actually assault them, then the author is guilty of false reporting. However, if Karen did grab the leash and push, then the author's report was truthful.\n\nThe author also mentions that Karen was screaming about \"slaving the puppy,\" which might imply the author felt harassed. The key here is whether the police had probable cause to arrest Karen. If the author's account is accurate, then the arrest was justified. However, if the author exaggerated or lied, then they might be in the wrong.\n\nIn conclusion, if the author truthfully reported an assault by Karen, they're not in the wrong. If they lied or provoked the situation, they might be. The story seems to indicate that Karen escalated the situation physically, leading to a legitimate arrest. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
