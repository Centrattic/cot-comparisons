I bought my dog for $2500 so this woman might faced  felony of the fifth degree, prison term of 6-12 months, and a fine no more than $2500. This is relevant at the end.\n\nThe incident happened three months ago. I was walking my dog and it was a beautiful day. I live in a really nice neighborhood. Most of the people living in the neighborhood are young adult that really health conscious, there are a lot of restaurant offering vegan menu and there is even a vegan bistro that we love.\n\nWhen I was walking my dog in the square, I saw DxE (direct action everywhere) protesting near the park. I thought it was good, I am not a vegan but I limit my meat consumption for ethical and health reason. I was just walking my puppy. A girl, let's call her Karen, ask me \"hey beautiful pup, what kind is that\" so I said it's Golden Retriever, it just that he has a really light color. I did not know she was part of the protest, she didn't have any sign and just dress normally.\n\nKaren next response was \"oh so it's pure breed, do you know that millions of dog got gassed every year in shelter?\" at this point I felt uncomfortable and started to just walk away but she kept following me. So I told her that I know that fact but choose going through breeder route because I want specific traits in my dog and I use a reputable breeder. I was keep walking and she said that I was being selfish for going through breeder route, she asked me what did I gave to my dog, I told her none of her business and please leave me alone. Karen started to lose her shit and called me the most selfish person she ever met that I am rude and she started called me name, I was just keep walking away from her, at this point she yelled at me that I am slaving my puppy and then she grabbed the leash, pushed me and tried to run with my puppy. Worf losing it and he wanted to come to me so I was able to take back the leash, and my neighbor helped me, he saw and hear everything. It happened so quick.\n\nWe went to police car near the location, told them what happened, and Karen was so stupid she kept following me and screaming on how I enslave my puppy. I explained everything and the police arrested Karen. The police revoke the DxE protestor permit because Karen was part of them and I felt bad because the other protestor were just doing their thing and I believe in free speech. When I reported Karen, I was scared but she might actually go to Jail, maybe she was so passionate but I don't think she deserved to be in jail, idk, I am a bit torn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who posted the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a conflict between the author and a vegan activist, leading to the activist being arrested.\n\nFirst, the author is walking their dog when a protester, Karen, starts talking to them. The conversation turns heated when Karen criticizes the author's decision to get a purebred dog from a breeder. The author claims Karen then becomes aggressive, grabbing the dog's leash and pushing them. The author reports the incident to the police, who arrest Karen. The author now faces a felony charge for reporting Karen, and they're wondering if they're at fault.\n\nThe key points to consider are the legality of the protest, the nature of the confrontation, and whether the author's actions were justified. In many places, protests are protected under free speech laws, especially if they're non-violent. However, if Karen's actions were aggressive or involved assault, that could be a different matter. The author mentions that Karen pushed them and tried to take the dog, which could be considered assault or battery, making it a criminal matter. \n\nThe author's responsibility here might hinge on whether they provoked the situation or escalated it unnecessarily. The initial conversation seems like a disagreement over personal choices, which is common in public. However, when Karen's actions turn physical, the line between free speech and assault might be crossed. The author's decision to report the incident to the police could be justified if Karen committed a crime. \n\nOn the other hand, if the police revoked the protest permit because of Karen's actions, it might affect the broader protest group. The author might not have known Karen was a protestor, so their intent wasn't to disrupt the protest but to address a personal act of aggression. \n\nThe potential felony charge against the author for reporting a crime is unusual, unless there's a law being violated by the report itself, which is less likely. The author might be facing charges due to a misunderstanding or a legal technicality. \n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, the author didn't start the confrontation. Karen initiated the argument and escalated it physically. The author's right to protect themselves and their property (the dog) is important. However, the author's reaction of calling the police could be seen as appropriate if assault occurred. \n\nThe author might be in the right if Karen's actions were criminal. However, if the disagreement was a verbal exchange without physical contact, the author's response might be excessive. The fact that the neighbor witnessed the incident supports the author's side. \n\nIn conclusion, the author's actions could be justified if Karen committed a crime. The key factors are whether Karen's actions were illegal and whether the author's report was a legitimate response to criminal behavior. If the police concluded that Karen committed a crime, the author isn't in the wrong for reporting it. However, if the police found the author at fault, that complicates things. But based on the description, it seems Karen's actions were the problem.\n"
