I bought my dog for $2500 so this woman might faced  felony of the fifth degree, prison term of 6-12 months, and a fine no more than $2500. This is relevant at the end.\n\nThe incident happened three months ago. I was walking my dog and it was a beautiful day. I live in a really nice neighborhood. Most of the people living in the neighborhood are young adult that really health conscious, there are a lot of restaurant offering vegan menu and there is even a vegan bistro that we love.\n\nWhen I was walking my dog in the square, I saw DxE (direct action everywhere) protesting near the park. I thought it was good, I am not a vegan but I limit my meat consumption for ethical and health reason. I was just walking my puppy. A girl, let's call her Karen, ask me \"hey beautiful pup, what kind is that\" so I said it's Golden Retriever, it just that he has a really light color. I did not know she was part of the protest, she didn't have any sign and just dress normally.\n\nKaren next response was \"oh so it's pure breed, do you know that millions of dog got gassed every year in shelter?\" at this point I felt uncomfortable and started to just walk away but she kept following me. So I told her that I know that fact but choose going through breeder route because I want specific traits in my dog and I use a reputable breeder. I was keep walking and she said that I was being selfish for going through breeder route, she asked me what did I gave to my dog, I told her none of her business and please leave me alone. Karen started to lose her shit and called me the most selfish person she ever met that I am rude and she started called me name, I was just keep walking away from her, at this point she yelled at me that I am slaving my puppy and then she grabbed the leash, pushed me and tried to run with my puppy. Worf losing it and he wanted to come to me so I was able to take back the leash, and my neighbor helped me, he saw and hear everything. It happened so quick.\n\nWe went to police car near the location, told them what happened, and Karen was so stupid she kept following me and screaming on how I enslave my puppy. I explained everything and the police arrested Karen. The police revoke the DxE protestor permit because Karen was part of them and I felt bad because the other protestor were just doing their thing and I believe in free speech. When I reported Karen, I was scared but she might actually go to Jail, maybe she was so passionate but I don't think she deserved to be in jail, idk, I am a bit torn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a conflict between the author and a vegan activist, Karen, who was part of a protest. The key points here are the actions of both parties.\n\nFirst, the author was walking their dog when Karen approached. Karen started a conversation, then made a comment about shelter dogs, which the author didn't like. The author tried to walk away but Karen followed, leading to an argument. Karen accused the author of being selfish for using a breeder, and the situation escalated when Karen grabbed the dog's leash and pushed the author. The author then called the police, leading to Karen's arrest.\n\nNow, I need to assess who is at fault here. The author's actions: they were defending their dog and reacting to what they perceived as harassment. They reported Karen after the physical altercation. The police arrested Karen, which suggests they found her actions to be criminal, like assault.\n\nKaren's actions: She approached someone, engaged in a conversation, but then escalated it by following the author, making accusations, and eventually grabbing the leash and pushing. That's assault, which is a criminal act. The police likely took that into account when arresting her.\n\nThe author's dilemma is about whether they were justified in reporting Karen. While the author was in their right to report a crime (the assault), the initial conflict might have been a misunderstanding. However, Karen's actions were clearly wrong. The author's intent was to protect themselves and their dog, which is reasonable.\n\nBut the author is questioning if they were wrong because Karen was part of a protest group. However, the other protesters weren't involved in the incident. The author didn't target the group but an individual who committed an assault.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for reporting a crime. Karen's actions were criminal, regardless of her activism. The author's response was appropriate given the physical assault.\n"
