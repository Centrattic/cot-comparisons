I bought my dog for $2500 so this woman might faced  felony of the fifth degree, prison term of 6-12 months, and a fine no more than $2500. This is relevant at the end.\n\nThe incident happened three months ago. I was walking my dog and it was a beautiful day. I live in a really nice neighborhood. Most of the people living in the neighborhood are young adult that really health conscious, there are a lot of restaurant offering vegan menu and there is even a vegan bistro that we love.\n\nWhen I was walking my dog in the square, I saw DxE (direct action everywhere) protesting near the park. I thought it was good, I am not a vegan but I limit my meat consumption for ethical and health reason. I was just walking my puppy. A girl, let's call her Karen, ask me \"hey beautiful pup, what kind is that\" so I said it's Golden Retriever, it just that he has a really light color. I did not know she was part of the protest, she didn't have any sign and just dress normally.\n\nKaren next response was \"oh so it's pure breed, do you know that millions of dog got gassed every year in shelter?\" at this point I felt uncomfortable and started to just walk away but she kept following me. So I told her that I know that fact but choose going through breeder route because I want specific traits in my dog and I use a reputable breeder. I was keep walking and she said that I was being selfish for going through breeder route, she asked me what did I gave to my dog, I told her none of her business and please leave me alone. Karen started to lose her shit and called me the most selfish person she ever met that I am rude and she started called me name, I was just keep walking away from her, at this point she yelled at me that I am slaving my puppy and then she grabbed the leash, pushed me and tried to run with my puppy. Worf losing it and he wanted to come to me so I was able to take back the leash, and my neighbor helped me, he saw and hear everything. It happened so quick.\n\nWe went to police car near the location, told them what happened, and Karen was so stupid she kept following me and screaming on how I enslave my puppy. I explained everything and the police arrested Karen. The police revoke the DxE protestor permit because Karen was part of them and I felt bad because the other protestor were just doing their thing and I believe in free speech. When I reported Karen, I was scared but she might actually go to Jail, maybe she was so passionate but I don't think she deserved to be in jail, idk, I am a bit torn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The user is asking whether they should be considered \"ata\" (assuming they mean \"at fault\") for reporting a vegan activist, leading to her arrest and a potential felony charge. \n\nFirst, let's recap the situation. The author was walking their dog in a neighborhood with a lot of health-conscious people. They encountered a woman from the DxE group protesting nearby. The woman (Karen) started talking to the author about their dog, then escalated to confrontational comments about dog breeding, called the author selfish, and then physically grabbed the dog's leash and pushed them. The author and a neighbor then reported the incident to the police, resulting in Karen's arrest. The author is now facing a court date and is worried about the consequences.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong, we need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. Legally, when someone is involved in a conflict, they have the right to report crimes. If Karen physically assaulted the author and tried to take the dog, that's a criminal act. The author's actions in reporting this would be justified. \n\nHowever, there might be nuances. The initial interaction started with Karen approaching the author. The author felt uncomfortable but tried to walk away. Karen then escalated the situation by grabbing the leash and pushing. The author's response was to involve the police, which is a standard procedure when someone is being attacked. \n\nEthically, the author might be questioned about whether they provoked the situation, but Karen's actions seem to have been unprovoked aggression after a discussion. The author's defense of their dog and own rights is understandable. Additionally, the author mentions feeling bad about affecting the protest, but it's important to differentiate between the individual's actions and the group's peaceful protest. \n\nAnother point is the potential felony charge. The severity of the charge depends on the local laws, but if Karen used force and attempted to take someone else's pet, that could indeed be a felony. The author reporting her is not wrong if the actions were criminal. \n\nBut there's a possible issue of whether the author's response was proportionate. However, given the physical assault and attempt to take the dog, the police involvement seems appropriate. The neighbor's testimony could support the author's account. \n\nIn summary, the author acted within their rights to report a crime that was committed against them. The activist's actions crossed the line into assault, and the author's response was to seek legal help, which is not wrong. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
