I bought my dog for $2500 so this woman might faced  felony of the fifth degree, prison term of 6-12 months, and a fine no more than $2500. This is relevant at the end.\n\nThe incident happened three months ago. I was walking my dog and it was a beautiful day. I live in a really nice neighborhood. Most of the people living in the neighborhood are young adult that really health conscious, there are a lot of restaurant offering vegan menu and there is even a vegan bistro that we love.\n\nWhen I was walking my dog in the square, I saw DxE (direct action everywhere) protesting near the park. I thought it was good, I am not a vegan but I limit my meat consumption for ethical and health reason. I was just walking my puppy. A girl, let's call her Karen, ask me \"hey beautiful pup, what kind is that\" so I said it's Golden Retriever, it just that he has a really light color. I did not know she was part of the protest, she didn't have any sign and just dress normally.\n\nKaren next response was \"oh so it's pure breed, do you know that millions of dog got gassed every year in shelter?\" at this point I felt uncomfortable and started to just walk away but she kept following me. So I told her that I know that fact but choose going through breeder route because I want specific traits in my dog and I use a reputable breeder. I was keep walking and she said that I was being selfish for going through breeder route, she asked me what did I gave to my dog, I told her none of her business and please leave me alone. Karen started to lose her shit and called me the most selfish person she ever met that I am rude and she started called me name, I was just keep walking away from her, at this point she yelled at me that I am slaving my puppy and then she grabbed the leash, pushed me and tried to run with my puppy. Worf losing it and he wanted to come to me so I was able to take back the leash, and my neighbor helped me, he saw and hear everything. It happened so quick.\n\nWe went to police car near the location, told them what happened, and Karen was so stupid she kept following me and screaming on how I enslave my puppy. I explained everything and the police arrested Karen. The police revoke the DxE protestor permit because Karen was part of them and I felt bad because the other protestor were just doing their thing and I believe in free speech. When I reported Karen, I was scared but she might actually go to Jail, maybe she was so passionate but I don't think she deserved to be in jail, idk, I am a bit torn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who reported the vegan activist is in the wrong. The situation involves a confrontation at a protest where Karen grabbed the leash of the person's dog and tried to run off with it. The person called the police, leading to Karen's arrest.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the legality of the situation. If Karen physically grabbed the dog and tried to take it, that's a clear act of assault or theft. The person has a right to defend their property and seek help from authorities. The police arresting her for assault makes sense here.\n\nBut there's a nuance: the protest was by DxE, which might have permits. However, the user mentioned the police revoked the protest's permit because of Karen's actions, which could suggest the protest was otherwise legal, but individual actions (like assault) are separate. The user might be concerned about overstepping by reporting someone for a personal conflict, but the key here is that Karen's actions were criminal. \n\nThe user's intent was to protect their dog. They didn't instigate the confrontation. Karen's aggressive behavior led to the police involvement. The person's actions in reporting a crime are justified. The fact that the user felt bad about the protest being shut down shows they considered free speech, but the arrest was due to Karen's illegal actions, not the protest itself. \n\nPotential issues: Did the user provoke Karen? The user responded to questions, but Karen escalated the situation. The user's choice to involve police was appropriate when the threat was physical. The outcome (felony charge) seems harsh, but if assault charges are involved, it's within legal bounds. \n\nSo, the answer is likely B (not in the wrong). The user acted to protect their property and safety, and the police's response was in line with the crime committed.\n"
