I bought my dog for $2500 so this woman might faced  felony of the fifth degree, prison term of 6-12 months, and a fine no more than $2500. This is relevant at the end.\n\nThe incident happened three months ago. I was walking my dog and it was a beautiful day. I live in a really nice neighborhood. Most of the people living in the neighborhood are young adult that really health conscious, there are a lot of restaurant offering vegan menu and there is even a vegan bistro that we love.\n\nWhen I was walking my dog in the square, I saw DxE (direct action everywhere) protesting near the park. I thought it was good, I am not a vegan but I limit my meat consumption for ethical and health reason. I was just walking my puppy. A girl, let's call her Karen, ask me \"hey beautiful pup, what kind is that\" so I said it's Golden Retriever, it just that he has a really light color. I did not know she was part of the protest, she didn't have any sign and just dress normally.\n\nKaren next response was \"oh so it's pure breed, do you know that millions of dog got gassed every year in shelter?\" at this point I felt uncomfortable and started to just walk away but she kept following me. So I told her that I know that fact but choose going through breeder route because I want specific traits in my dog and I use a reputable breeder. I was keep walking and she said that I was being selfish for going through breeder route, she asked me what did I gave to my dog, I told her none of her business and please leave me alone. Karen started to lose her shit and called me the most selfish person she ever met that I am rude and she started called me name, I was just keep walking away from her, at this point she yelled at me that I am slaving my puppy and then she grabbed the leash, pushed me and tried to run with my puppy. Worf losing it and he wanted to come to me so I was able to take back the leash, and my neighbor helped me, he saw and hear everything. It happened so quick.\n\nWe went to police car near the location, told them what happened, and Karen was so stupid she kept following me and screaming on how I enslave my puppy. I explained everything and the police arrested Karen. The police revoke the DxE protestor permit because Karen was part of them and I felt bad because the other protestor were just doing their thing and I believe in free speech. When I reported Karen, I was scared but she might actually go to Jail, maybe she was so passionate but I don't think she deserved to be in jail, idk, I am a bit torn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the person was walking their dog when a vegan activist, Karen, approached them. They had a conversation about purebred dogs and shelters. Karen got aggressive, called the author names, tried to grab the dog's leash, pushed them, and the author reported her. The police arrested Karen, and now the author is facing a felony charge from reporting her. The question is whether the author is at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the actions of both parties. The author says that Karen approached them, initially with a friendly comment about the dog. Then Karen brought up the topic of shelter dogs being gassed. The author tried to leave, but Karen followed, got aggressive, called them names, tried to take the dog, and pushed them. The author then reported her, leading to her arrest. \n\nNow, the key points here are whether the author had a valid reason to report Karen. If Karen committed a crime, like assault or theft (trying to take the dog), then the author is within their rights to report the incident. However, the author might be in the wrong if their initial interaction was inappropriate or if they provoked the situation.\n\nIn the scenario, the author was in a public place, walking their dog. The conversation started with a compliment, then turned into an argument. The author was trying to walk away but Karen escalated the situation. The author claims that Karen pushed them and tried to take the dog, which would be assault and attempted theft. In that case, the author's action of reporting to the police is justified as they were protecting themselves and their pet. \n\nHowever, there's a part where the author mentions that they told Karen to leave them alone, but Karen kept following. The author might have felt threatened, so their reaction of calling the police is reasonable. Also, the fact that a neighbor witnessed the event supports the author's account. \n\nBut there's a potential issue with the author's own behavior. They were in a neighborhood with many health-conscious people and vegan businesses. The author isn't vegan but limits meat consumption. When Karen questioned their choice of getting a purebred from a breeder, the author responded about wanting specific traits and a reputable breeder. Karen's response was aggressive, but the author's response was to tell her to leave. The author might have felt that Karen was harassing them after being asked to stop. \n\nHowever, some might argue that the author was in a public place and shouldn't have engaged in a confrontation. But given that Karen physically tried to take the dog and pushed the author, the author's response seems to be self-defense. Reporting the incident is a standard procedure in such cases. \n\nThe felony charge the author is facing is concerning. Depending on the jurisdiction, if the report was made in good faith, the author might not be at fault. However, if the police determined that Karen was acting within her rights to protest and that the author's report was a misuse of police resources, then the author could be in the wrong. \n\nBut the key here is that Karen's actions went beyond peaceful protest. She physically assaulted the author and tried to take the dog. If the police arrested Karen, it's because they saw a crime occur. The author's decision to report was appropriate in that case. \n\nOn the other hand, if the author felt Karen was just being loud or aggressive in her protest, but didn't physically threaten them, then calling the police might be seen as overreaching. However, in this case, the author states that Karen pushed them and tried to take the dog. That's a physical altercation, which is a criminal act. \n\nSo, given that Karen committed a crime by using physical force and attempting to take the dog, the author was justified in reporting her. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. \n\nBut wait, there's also the part where the author mentions that the other protestors were just doing their thing, and they believe in free speech. The author might feel guilty about the arrest because it was a protest, but if Karen's actions were criminal, then the protest's peaceful nature isn't a factor in her individual criminal behavior. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong for reporting a crime. The answer would be B (No).\n"
