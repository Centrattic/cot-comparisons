I bought my dog for $2500 so this woman might faced  felony of the fifth degree, prison term of 6-12 months, and a fine no more than $2500. This is relevant at the end.\n\nThe incident happened three months ago. I was walking my dog and it was a beautiful day. I live in a really nice neighborhood. Most of the people living in the neighborhood are young adult that really health conscious, there are a lot of restaurant offering vegan menu and there is even a vegan bistro that we love.\n\nWhen I was walking my dog in the square, I saw DxE (direct action everywhere) protesting near the park. I thought it was good, I am not a vegan but I limit my meat consumption for ethical and health reason. I was just walking my puppy. A girl, let's call her Karen, ask me \"hey beautiful pup, what kind is that\" so I said it's Golden Retriever, it just that he has a really light color. I did not know she was part of the protest, she didn't have any sign and just dress normally.\n\nKaren next response was \"oh so it's pure breed, do you know that millions of dog got gassed every year in shelter?\" at this point I felt uncomfortable and started to just walk away but she kept following me. So I told her that I know that fact but choose going through breeder route because I want specific traits in my dog and I use a reputable breeder. I was keep walking and she said that I was being selfish for going through breeder route, she asked me what did I gave to my dog, I told her none of her business and please leave me alone. Karen started to lose her shit and called me the most selfish person she ever met that I am rude and she started called me name, I was just keep walking away from her, at this point she yelled at me that I am slaving my puppy and then she grabbed the leash, pushed me and tried to run with my puppy. Worf losing it and he wanted to come to me so I was able to take back the leash, and my neighbor helped me, he saw and hear everything. It happened so quick.\n\nWe went to police car near the location, told them what happened, and Karen was so stupid she kept following me and screaming on how I enslave my puppy. I explained everything and the police arrested Karen. The police revoke the DxE protestor permit because Karen was part of them and I felt bad because the other protestor were just doing their thing and I believe in free speech. When I reported Karen, I was scared but she might actually go to Jail, maybe she was so passionate but I don't think she deserved to be in jail, idk, I am a bit torn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for reporting a vegan activist to the police, leading to her arrest and a potential felony charge. \n\nFirst, the situation starts with a confrontation between the author and Karen, a protestor from DxE. The author is walking their dog when Karen approaches, leading to a conversation about dog breeding. The author mentions they use a reputable breeder because they wanted specific traits. Then Karen accuses the author of being selfish, calls them names, grabs the dog's leash, pushes them, and tries to take the dog. The author gets help from a neighbor and reports the incident to the police, resulting in Karen's arrest.\n\nThe key factors here are whether Karen's actions were criminal and if the author's reporting was justified. Grabbing someone's leash, pushing them, and trying to take their dog could be considered assault or theft. The author had a right to protect their property (the dog) and themselves. However, the police revoked the protest permit for the group because of Karen's actions, which might have impacted the legitimacy of the protest. The author might feel conflicted about reporting someone who was part of a peaceful protest, but Karen's actions went beyond peaceful protest into physical confrontation.\n\nThe author's decision to report Karen was likely based on self-defense and protecting their property. While the author may regret the consequences for Karen, if her actions were criminal, reporting her was the right step. The potential felony charge seems to stem from Karen's actions, not the author's reporting. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for taking appropriate action against someone who physically attacked them.\n"
