I bought my dog for $2500 so this woman might faced  felony of the fifth degree, prison term of 6-12 months, and a fine no more than $2500. This is relevant at the end.\n\nThe incident happened three months ago. I was walking my dog and it was a beautiful day. I live in a really nice neighborhood. Most of the people living in the neighborhood are young adult that really health conscious, there are a lot of restaurant offering vegan menu and there is even a vegan bistro that we love.\n\nWhen I was walking my dog in the square, I saw DxE (direct action everywhere) protesting near the park. I thought it was good, I am not a vegan but I limit my meat consumption for ethical and health reason. I was just walking my puppy. A girl, let's call her Karen, ask me \"hey beautiful pup, what kind is that\" so I said it's Golden Retriever, it just that he has a really light color. I did not know she was part of the protest, she didn't have any sign and just dress normally.\n\nKaren next response was \"oh so it's pure breed, do you know that millions of dog got gassed every year in shelter?\" at this point I felt uncomfortable and started to just walk away but she kept following me. So I told her that I know that fact but choose going through breeder route because I want specific traits in my dog and I use a reputable breeder. I was keep walking and she said that I was being selfish for going through breeder route, she asked me what did I gave to my dog, I told her none of her business and please leave me alone. Karen started to lose her shit and called me the most selfish person she ever met that I am rude and she started called me name, I was just keep walking away from her, at this point she yelled at me that I am slaving my puppy and then she grabbed the leash, pushed me and tried to run with my puppy. Worf losing it and he wanted to come to me so I was able to take back the leash, and my neighbor helped me, he saw and hear everything. It happened so quick.\n\nWe went to police car near the location, told them what happened, and Karen was so stupid she kept following me and screaming on how I enslave my puppy. I explained everything and the police arrested Karen. The police revoke the DxE protestor permit because Karen was part of them and I felt bad because the other protestor were just doing their thing and I believe in free speech. When I reported Karen, I was scared but she might actually go to Jail, maybe she was so passionate but I don't think she deserved to be in jail, idk, I am a bit torn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who reported the vegan activist is in the wrong. The situation involves a confrontation between the author and Karen during a protest.\n\nFirst, the author was walking their dog when Karen approached and started a conversation. Karen then accused the author of contributing to shelter overcrowding by getting a purebred from a breeder. The author tried to leave, but Karen followed, became aggressive, called the author names, and even tried to grab the dog. The author and a neighbor then reported Karen to the police, leading to her arrest and potential felony charges.\n\nNow, the key points here are about the justification for the police report. The author claims self-defense and protection of their property (the dog). They mention that Karen physically tried to take the dog, which could be considered assault or theft. The police took action, revoking the protest permit because Karen was part of the DxE group, possibly indicating that her actions went beyond peaceful protest.\n\nThe author is now facing a court case, and they're questioning if they were in the wrong for reporting Karen. The question is whether the author is at fault. \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, if Karen physically attacked or attempted to take the dog, the author had the right to defend themselves and their property. Reporting a crime to the police is a citizen's duty. However, if Karen's actions were within the bounds of free speech and the author escalated the situation by involving the police unnecessarily, that could be a different scenario. \n\nThe author mentions that they felt bad about the other protesters being affected, indicating they respect free speech. But Karen's actions were aggressive and possibly criminal. The police's decision to revoke the protest permit suggests they saw Karen's behavior as outside the protest's bounds.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, the author didn't initiate the conflict. Karen's aggressive behavior led to the escalation. The author's response was to seek help from the police, which is standard. However, taking legal action might be seen as harsh if the incident was minor. But given the physical confrontation and attempted theft of the dog, it's a more serious matter.\n\nPossible arguments against the author: Maybe the author overreacted by reporting Karen, or the police shouldn't have revoked the permit for one person's actions. But the police's decision implies they found Karen's actions deserving of arrest. Also, the author's intent was to protect their dog, which is a valid concern.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's actions were in response to Karen's aggression and potential crime. Since the police took action, it's likely justified. The author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
