I bought my dog for $2500 so this woman might faced  felony of the fifth degree, prison term of 6-12 months, and a fine no more than $2500. This is relevant at the end.\n\nThe incident happened three months ago. I was walking my dog and it was a beautiful day. I live in a really nice neighborhood. Most of the people living in the neighborhood are young adult that really health conscious, there are a lot of restaurant offering vegan menu and there is even a vegan bistro that we love.\n\nWhen I was walking my dog in the square, I saw DxE (direct action everywhere) protesting near the park. I thought it was good, I am not a vegan but I limit my meat consumption for ethical and health reason. I was just walking my puppy. A girl, let's call her Karen, ask me \"hey beautiful pup, what kind is that\" so I said it's Golden Retriever, it just that he has a really light color. I did not know she was part of the protest, she didn't have any sign and just dress normally.\n\nKaren next response was \"oh so it's pure breed, do you know that millions of dog got gassed every year in shelter?\" at this point I felt uncomfortable and started to just walk away but she kept following me. So I told her that I know that fact but choose going through breeder route because I want specific traits in my dog and I use a reputable breeder. I was keep walking and she said that I was being selfish for going through breeder route, she asked me what did I gave to my dog, I told her none of her business and please leave me alone. Karen started to lose her shit and called me the most selfish person she ever met that I am rude and she started called me name, I was just keep walking away from her, at this point she yelled at me that I am slaving my puppy and then she grabbed the leash, pushed me and tried to run with my puppy. Worf losing it and he wanted to come to me so I was able to take back the leash, and my neighbor helped me, he saw and hear everything. It happened so quick.\n\nWe went to police car near the location, told them what happened, and Karen was so stupid she kept following me and screaming on how I enslave my puppy. I explained everything and the police arrested Karen. The police revoke the DxE protestor permit because Karen was part of them and I felt bad because the other protestor were just doing their thing and I believe in free speech. When I reported Karen, I was scared but she might actually go to Jail, maybe she was so passionate but I don't think she deserved to be in jail, idk, I am a bit torn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves reporting a vegan activist who got arrested for trying to take their dog.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the sequence of events. The author was walking their dog when a protestor, Karen, started a conversation. Karen then confronted the author about being a breeder, leading to an argument. Karen allegedly grabbed the leash, pushed the author, and tried to take the dog. The author reported her, leading to her arrest and potential felony charges.\n\nNow, legal aspects. The key issue is whether Karen's actions constitute a crime. If she physically assaulted the author and tried to take the dog, that's a criminal act. The author reporting the incident to the police when they were attacked seems justified. The police took action, which suggests they saw a crime occurred.\n\nBut wait, did the author have a duty to de-escalate instead of calling the police? Maybe, but when someone is physically attacking you, self-defense and seeking police help are reasonable. Also, Karen was part of a protest, but the police revoked the permit for the group because of her actions. That could be a consequence of her actions, but the author might not be responsible for that.\n\nThe author mentions feeling torn because they support free speech. However, the other protestors weren't involved in the physical altercation. The author's responsibility is for their own actions. They didn't provoke Karen beyond the initial conversation. Karen escalated the situation by attacking the author and trying to take the dog.\n\nAnother point: the author bought the dog from a breeder. Karen's argument against breeders might be part of her activist stance, but the author's choice doesn't make them at fault. The author had the right to defend themselves.\n\nPotential issues: Did the author have any prior issues with the protest? No, they just had a conversation. Did they initiate conflict? No, they were trying to walk away. Karen's actions were the catalyst. The author's response was self-defense and seeking help.\n\nConclusion: The author is not in the wrong because they were protecting themselves from an attack. Reporting a crime when it happens is their right and responsibility. The charges against Karen stem from her actions, not the author's.\n"
