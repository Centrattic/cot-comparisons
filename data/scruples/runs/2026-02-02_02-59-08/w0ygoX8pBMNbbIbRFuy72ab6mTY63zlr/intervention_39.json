I bought my dog for $2500 so this woman might faced  felony of the fifth degree, prison term of 6-12 months, and a fine no more than $2500. This is relevant at the end.\n\nThe incident happened three months ago. I was walking my dog and it was a beautiful day. I live in a really nice neighborhood. Most of the people living in the neighborhood are young adult that really health conscious, there are a lot of restaurant offering vegan menu and there is even a vegan bistro that we love.\n\nWhen I was walking my dog in the square, I saw DxE (direct action everywhere) protesting near the park. I thought it was good, I am not a vegan but I limit my meat consumption for ethical and health reason. I was just walking my puppy. A girl, let's call her Karen, ask me \"hey beautiful pup, what kind is that\" so I said it's Golden Retriever, it just that he has a really light color. I did not know she was part of the protest, she didn't have any sign and just dress normally.\n\nKaren next response was \"oh so it's pure breed, do you know that millions of dog got gassed every year in shelter?\" at this point I felt uncomfortable and started to just walk away but she kept following me. So I told her that I know that fact but choose going through breeder route because I want specific traits in my dog and I use a reputable breeder. I was keep walking and she said that I was being selfish for going through breeder route, she asked me what did I gave to my dog, I told her none of her business and please leave me alone. Karen started to lose her shit and called me the most selfish person she ever met that I am rude and she started called me name, I was just keep walking away from her, at this point she yelled at me that I am slaving my puppy and then she grabbed the leash, pushed me and tried to run with my puppy. Worf losing it and he wanted to come to me so I was able to take back the leash, and my neighbor helped me, he saw and hear everything. It happened so quick.\n\nWe went to police car near the location, told them what happened, and Karen was so stupid she kept following me and screaming on how I enslave my puppy. I explained everything and the police arrested Karen. The police revoke the DxE protestor permit because Karen was part of them and I felt bad because the other protestor were just doing their thing and I believe in free speech. When I reported Karen, I was scared but she might actually go to Jail, maybe she was so passionate but I don't think she deserved to be in jail, idk, I am a bit torn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who reported the vegan activist is in the wrong. The situation involves a confrontation between the author and Karen, a protester from DxE.\n\nFirst, the key points: The author is walking their dog, Karen approaches and starts a conversation. The conversation turns into an argument about dog breeding, and Karen physically grabs the leash and tries to take the dog. The author reports her, leading to her arrest and possible felony charges.\n\nI need to consider the legal aspects here. The author claims Karen assaulted them by grabbing the leash and pushing them. Assault is a criminal offense, so reporting it would be justified. However, the author might be overreacting if the incident wasn't a true assault. The author's neighbor witnessed the event, which supports their account.\n\nBut wait, the author mentions that Karen was part of a protest group, and the police revoked the protest's permit because of her actions. The author feels conflicted about this. The other protesters were peaceful, so the author's report might have affected the entire protest. However, the author's primary concern was their own safety and the safety of their dog. \n\nAnother angle: the author's motivation. They bought the dog for $2500 and might be protective. But the core issue is whether there was an actual assault. If Karen physically attacked the author, then the report is justified. The author didn't instigate the confrontation; they were trying to defuse it by walking away. Karen escalated it by grabbing the leash and pushing.\n\nPossible counterpoints: The author might have provoked Karen by mentioning breeders. But Karen was the one who confronted them first. Also, the author could have tried to de-escalate further without involving police, but given the physical threat, calling the police is a reasonable response.\n\nLegal perspective: Assault is a serious charge. If Karen did push the author and grab the leash, that's a felony. The author's report led to her arrest, which is appropriate. The author might feel guilty about the consequences for the protest, but they have a right to report a crime against them.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author acted within their rights to report an assault. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
