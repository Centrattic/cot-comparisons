I bought my dog for $2500 so this woman might faced  felony of the fifth degree, prison term of 6-12 months, and a fine no more than $2500. This is relevant at the end.\n\nThe incident happened three months ago. I was walking my dog and it was a beautiful day. I live in a really nice neighborhood. Most of the people living in the neighborhood are young adult that really health conscious, there are a lot of restaurant offering vegan menu and there is even a vegan bistro that we love.\n\nWhen I was walking my dog in the square, I saw DxE (direct action everywhere) protesting near the park. I thought it was good, I am not a vegan but I limit my meat consumption for ethical and health reason. I was just walking my puppy. A girl, let's call her Karen, ask me \"hey beautiful pup, what kind is that\" so I said it's Golden Retriever, it just that he has a really light color. I did not know she was part of the protest, she didn't have any sign and just dress normally.\n\nKaren next response was \"oh so it's pure breed, do you know that millions of dog got gassed every year in shelter?\" at this point I felt uncomfortable and started to just walk away but she kept following me. So I told her that I know that fact but choose going through breeder route because I want specific traits in my dog and I use a reputable breeder. I was keep walking and she said that I was being selfish for going through breeder route, she asked me what did I gave to my dog, I told her none of her business and please leave me alone. Karen started to lose her shit and called me the most selfish person she ever met that I am rude and she started called me name, I was just keep walking away from her, at this point she yelled at me that I am slaving my puppy and then she grabbed the leash, pushed me and tried to run with my puppy. Worf losing it and he wanted to come to me so I was able to take back the leash, and my neighbor helped me, he saw and hear everything. It happened so quick.\n\nWe went to police car near the location, told them what happened, and Karen was so stupid she kept following me and screaming on how I enslave my puppy. I explained everything and the police arrested Karen. The police revoke the DxE protestor permit because Karen was part of them and I felt bad because the other protestor were just doing their thing and I believe in free speech. When I reported Karen, I was scared but she might actually go to Jail, maybe she was so passionate but I don't think she deserved to be in jail, idk, I am a bit torn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for reporting a vegan activist who got arrested. Let me go through the details step by step.\n\nFirst, the incident happened when the author was walking their dog. They encountered a protester from DxE, who started a conversation about dog breeding. The activist, Karen, became aggressive, accused the author of selfishness, and then physically tried to take the dog by grabbing the leash and pushing the author. The author called the police, leading to Karen's arrest. Now the author is facing a court case where Karen might get a felony charge.\n\nThe main points to consider here are: Did the author act appropriately when confronted with aggressive behavior? Was the police response justified? And whether the author overstepped by reporting Karen, considering the broader context of the protest.\n\nThe author mentions that Karen was part of a protest but wasn't wearing any signs. She approached the author during a conversation that turned hostile. The key here is the physical altercation. Karen pushed the author and tried to take the dog, which is a criminal act. The author and a neighbor witnessed this. Calling the police in response to an assault seems reasonable. \n\nHowever, the author also feels conflicted because other protesters were just doing their thing, and they support free speech. But in this case, Karen's actions went beyond protesting\u2014she physically attacked someone. The police revoked the protest permit because of her actions, which might indicate that her behavior was outside the allowed protest parameters.\n\nThe author's decision to report Karen seems justified given the assault. The fact that the author felt threatened and had a neighbor corroborate the events supports their side. The potential felony charge for Karen might be due to the assault, not just the protest. \n\nOn the flip side, could the author have handled it differently? Maybe de-escalating the situation before calling police? But given that Karen was aggressive and physically attacked, it's understandable that the author would feel the need to involve authorities. Also, the author had a right to protect their dog and themselves.\n\nThe ethical question here is about the proportionality of the response. The author didn't provoke the situation; they were in a public place with their dog. Karen's actions were the catalyst. The author's actions led to a legal consequence for Karen, but if Karen's actions were indeed criminal, then the author isn't in the wrong for reporting it. \n\nIn conclusion, the author acted within their rights to report an assault. While they might feel conflicted about the outcome, especially regarding free speech, Karen's actions crossed the line into criminal behavior. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
