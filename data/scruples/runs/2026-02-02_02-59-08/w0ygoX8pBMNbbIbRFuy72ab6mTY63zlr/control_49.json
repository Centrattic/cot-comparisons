I bought my dog for $2500 so this woman might faced  felony of the fifth degree, prison term of 6-12 months, and a fine no more than $2500. This is relevant at the end.\n\nThe incident happened three months ago. I was walking my dog and it was a beautiful day. I live in a really nice neighborhood. Most of the people living in the neighborhood are young adult that really health conscious, there are a lot of restaurant offering vegan menu and there is even a vegan bistro that we love.\n\nWhen I was walking my dog in the square, I saw DxE (direct action everywhere) protesting near the park. I thought it was good, I am not a vegan but I limit my meat consumption for ethical and health reason. I was just walking my puppy. A girl, let's call her Karen, ask me \"hey beautiful pup, what kind is that\" so I said it's Golden Retriever, it just that he has a really light color. I did not know she was part of the protest, she didn't have any sign and just dress normally.\n\nKaren next response was \"oh so it's pure breed, do you know that millions of dog got gassed every year in shelter?\" at this point I felt uncomfortable and started to just walk away but she kept following me. So I told her that I know that fact but choose going through breeder route because I want specific traits in my dog and I use a reputable breeder. I was keep walking and she said that I was being selfish for going through breeder route, she asked me what did I gave to my dog, I told her none of her business and please leave me alone. Karen started to lose her shit and called me the most selfish person she ever met that I am rude and she started called me name, I was just keep walking away from her, at this point she yelled at me that I am slaving my puppy and then she grabbed the leash, pushed me and tried to run with my puppy. Worf losing it and he wanted to come to me so I was able to take back the leash, and my neighbor helped me, he saw and hear everything. It happened so quick.\n\nWe went to police car near the location, told them what happened, and Karen was so stupid she kept following me and screaming on how I enslave my puppy. I explained everything and the police arrested Karen. The police revoke the DxE protestor permit because Karen was part of them and I felt bad because the other protestor were just doing their thing and I believe in free speech. When I reported Karen, I was scared but she might actually go to Jail, maybe she was so passionate but I don't think she deserved to be in jail, idk, I am a bit torn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for reporting a vegan activist to the police, leading to her arrest and a possible felony charge. The situation involves a confrontation between the author and Karen during a protest.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the sequence of events. The author was walking their dog when Karen approached and started a conversation. The conversation turned heated when Karen accused the author of being selfish for getting a purebred dog and then escalated to her grabbing the dog's leash and pushing the author. The author then reported the incident to the police, resulting in Karen's arrest. The author is now facing a felony charge in response, possibly because of the value of the dog (which they bought for $2500) and the legal charges against Karen.\n\nThe key points here are about the justification for reporting Karen. Did Karen's actions constitute a criminal offense? Grabbing someone's leash and pushing them could be considered assault or battery, which are criminal acts. The author's actions in reporting the incident might be seen as justified if Karen used force. However, the author's initial provocation is worth considering. Karen approached in a protest context, which is protected speech, but her actions went beyond peaceful protest when she physically confronted the author.\n\nThe author might not be in the wrong if Karen's actions were indeed illegal. However, the author's response\u2014reporting her to the police\u2014was appropriate in the context of an assault. The author also had a witness (the neighbor), which supports their account. On the other hand, it's possible that the author could have de-escalated the situation without involving the police, but given the physical aggression, reporting it is a valid step.\n\nThe potential felony charge against Karen (like fifth-degree felony with possible prison time and a fine) might be disproportionate if it's a first-time offense or if the physical harm was minor. However, the author's dog was expensive, which might have influenced the charges. The author might also be facing charges if the court finds that the report was malicious, but that's a bit of a stretch if Karen did indeed commit an assault.\n\nIn summary, the author's actions seem to be a response to an aggressive act by Karen, which would make the author not at fault. The main issue is whether Karen's actions were a crime, which they likely were. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for reporting the incident.\n"
