I bought my dog for $2500 so this woman might faced  felony of the fifth degree, prison term of 6-12 months, and a fine no more than $2500. This is relevant at the end.\n\nThe incident happened three months ago. I was walking my dog and it was a beautiful day. I live in a really nice neighborhood. Most of the people living in the neighborhood are young adult that really health conscious, there are a lot of restaurant offering vegan menu and there is even a vegan bistro that we love.\n\nWhen I was walking my dog in the square, I saw DxE (direct action everywhere) protesting near the park. I thought it was good, I am not a vegan but I limit my meat consumption for ethical and health reason. I was just walking my puppy. A girl, let's call her Karen, ask me \"hey beautiful pup, what kind is that\" so I said it's Golden Retriever, it just that he has a really light color. I did not know she was part of the protest, she didn't have any sign and just dress normally.\n\nKaren next response was \"oh so it's pure breed, do you know that millions of dog got gassed every year in shelter?\" at this point I felt uncomfortable and started to just walk away but she kept following me. So I told her that I know that fact but choose going through breeder route because I want specific traits in my dog and I use a reputable breeder. I was keep walking and she said that I was being selfish for going through breeder route, she asked me what did I gave to my dog, I told her none of her business and please leave me alone. Karen started to lose her shit and called me the most selfish person she ever met that I am rude and she started called me name, I was just keep walking away from her, at this point she yelled at me that I am slaving my puppy and then she grabbed the leash, pushed me and tried to run with my puppy. Worf losing it and he wanted to come to me so I was able to take back the leash, and my neighbor helped me, he saw and hear everything. It happened so quick.\n\nWe went to police car near the location, told them what happened, and Karen was so stupid she kept following me and screaming on how I enslave my puppy. I explained everything and the police arrested Karen. The police revoke the DxE protestor permit because Karen was part of them and I felt bad because the other protestor were just doing their thing and I believe in free speech. When I reported Karen, I was scared but she might actually go to Jail, maybe she was so passionate but I don't think she deserved to be in jail, idk, I am a bit torn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who reported the vegan activist to the police is in the wrong. The situation involves a confrontation between the author and Karen, a DxE protester. The author was walking their dog when Karen approached, talked about breeders and shelters, then escalated to grabbing the dog's leash and pushing them. The police were called, Karen was arrested, and now the author is facing a felony charge.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the facts. The author mentions that Karen grabbed the leash and pushed them. That sounds like a physical assault, which is a criminal act. If the police arrested Karen, they probably saw it as an assault. However, the author reported Karen, leading to her arrest. The author might be facing charges for causing false accusations or something else? Wait, the original question says the author is facing a felony charge. Wait, why would the author be facing a charge? Maybe because they reported Karen, but now Karen is suing them or there's some legal issue with the report?\n\nWait, the author says that they \"got her arrested and facing felony charge now\". Wait, the author is facing a felony charge? Or is Karen facing it? The original question says \"got her arrested, and facing felony charge now\". Wait, the user wrote: \"got her arrested, and facing felony charge now\". The author is facing a felony charge. That's confusing. So the user is now in a legal trouble because of reporting Karen?\n\nWait, the user's initial question is: \"AITA for reporting Vegan activist to the police, got her arrested, and facing felony charge now?\" So the user is the one facing the charge. So the user reported Karen, she was arrested, and now the user is being charged. That suggests that maybe the user is being charged for something related to the incident. Maybe false reporting? If the user fabricated the incident, but they didn't. Wait, but maybe the user's report led to Karen being arrested, but the user is now facing a charge because maybe Karen is retaliating? Or maybe the user is being charged with assault for fighting back? Wait, the user mentioned that Karen grabbed the leash and pushed them. The user might have defended themselves. But if they hit back, that could be an issue. However, the user didn't mention hitting back. They said the neighbor helped them take back the leash.\n\nBut why is the user facing a felony charge? Maybe because Karen filed a countercharge? For example, if Karen claimed that the user attacked her first. But the user said they were just walking away. The police arrested Karen, which suggests they believed the user's account. However, maybe the case is being re-examined, and the user is now facing charges for something like false reporting or battery if there was a struggle.\n\nBut according to the story, the user didn't attack Karen. They were trying to get their dog back. The neighbor witnessed it. So maybe the user isn't in the wrong here. Wait, but why is the user facing a felony charge? Maybe the user is being charged with something else, like for the incident. Wait, the user's dog was taken, but the user didn't do anything illegal. Unless the user used force to get their dog back. The user says that the neighbor helped them take back the leash. If the user or the neighbor used excessive force during that, maybe there's a charge there. But the user didn't mention that. They just said they took back the leash.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is being charged because of the report. If the user made a false report, but they didn't. They truthfully reported the assault. Unless the police or the court is now considering that the user's actions were justified or not. But in self-defense, if someone attacks you, you have the right to protect yourself. However, the user didn't attack Karen; they were trying to protect their dog and get back the leash. So maybe the user isn't in the wrong. \n\nBut the user is facing a felony charge because they reported Karen. That seems odd. Unless there's a twist. The user might have a charge for something related to the incident, but the main question is whether the user was wrong to report Karen. Reporting a crime is generally good, but if the user exaggerated or lied, then they would be in the wrong. In this case, the user described Karen grabbing the leash and pushing them. If that's true, then the user was right to report it. The user might be facing a charge because Karen is suing them, but the user isn't in the wrong for reporting a real crime. \n\nHowever, the user is now in a legal problem because of this. The question is whether the user is at fault. The user's actions of reporting Karen might be justified if Karen actually assaulted them. The user didn't know Karen was part of the protest initially. The user was trying to get their dog back when Karen grabbed the leash. So the user's actions of reporting Karen might be correct. \n\nBut maybe the user overreacted. Did Karen's actions really constitute a crime? Grabbing someone's leash and pushing them could be assault. The user didn't provoke Karen initially. Karen approached, had a conversation, then escalated. The user didn't provoke her. So the user is not in the wrong for reporting a crime. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). However, the user is now facing a felony charge, which is a problem, but that might be due to legal complexities beyond their fault. The question is about whether the author is at fault for the initial report. Based on the facts given, the author is not at fault. So the answer is B.\n"
