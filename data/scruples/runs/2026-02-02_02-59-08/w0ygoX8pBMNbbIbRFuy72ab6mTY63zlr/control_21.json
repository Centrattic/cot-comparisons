I bought my dog for $2500 so this woman might faced  felony of the fifth degree, prison term of 6-12 months, and a fine no more than $2500. This is relevant at the end.\n\nThe incident happened three months ago. I was walking my dog and it was a beautiful day. I live in a really nice neighborhood. Most of the people living in the neighborhood are young adult that really health conscious, there are a lot of restaurant offering vegan menu and there is even a vegan bistro that we love.\n\nWhen I was walking my dog in the square, I saw DxE (direct action everywhere) protesting near the park. I thought it was good, I am not a vegan but I limit my meat consumption for ethical and health reason. I was just walking my puppy. A girl, let's call her Karen, ask me \"hey beautiful pup, what kind is that\" so I said it's Golden Retriever, it just that he has a really light color. I did not know she was part of the protest, she didn't have any sign and just dress normally.\n\nKaren next response was \"oh so it's pure breed, do you know that millions of dog got gassed every year in shelter?\" at this point I felt uncomfortable and started to just walk away but she kept following me. So I told her that I know that fact but choose going through breeder route because I want specific traits in my dog and I use a reputable breeder. I was keep walking and she said that I was being selfish for going through breeder route, she asked me what did I gave to my dog, I told her none of her business and please leave me alone. Karen started to lose her shit and called me the most selfish person she ever met that I am rude and she started called me name, I was just keep walking away from her, at this point she yelled at me that I am slaving my puppy and then she grabbed the leash, pushed me and tried to run with my puppy. Worf losing it and he wanted to come to me so I was able to take back the leash, and my neighbor helped me, he saw and hear everything. It happened so quick.\n\nWe went to police car near the location, told them what happened, and Karen was so stupid she kept following me and screaming on how I enslave my puppy. I explained everything and the police arrested Karen. The police revoke the DxE protestor permit because Karen was part of them and I felt bad because the other protestor were just doing their thing and I believe in free speech. When I reported Karen, I was scared but she might actually go to Jail, maybe she was so passionate but I don't think she deserved to be in jail, idk, I am a bit torn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who reported the vegan activist is in the wrong. The situation involves a dog breeder confrontation where the activist, Karen, ended up arrested.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the facts. The author was walking their dog, which they bought from a breeder. Karen approached, had a conversation about dog breeding, then escalated to an argument. She grabbed the leash, pushed the author, and tried to take the dog. The neighbor witnessed it and helped. The police were called, and Karen was arrested. Now the author is facing a felony charge for reporting her and is wondering if they did wrong.\n\nKey points: The author's actions led to Karen's arrest. The question is whether the author is at fault. The law in the US allows for self-defense and reporting crimes. If Karen physically assaulted the author and tried to take the dog, that's a criminal act. The author reporting it would be justified. However, if the author provoked the situation or there's no actual crime, maybe they're at fault.\n\nBut according to the story, the author didn't instigate the conflict. Karen approached them first. The physical assault (grabbing the leash, pushing) is a crime. The author reported it and the police handled it. The fact that the author faced a charge for reporting is odd. In most cases, reporting a crime isn't a crime unless there's a malicious intent. However, if the police determined that the author lied or falsified the report, that's different. The author's account suggests they're telling the truth about what happened.\n\nAlso, the author mentions feeling torn because they believe in free speech, but Karen's actions went beyond protest into physical confrontation. The author didn't target the protest, just the individual who attacked them. So the arrest was a result of Karen's criminal behavior, not the protest itself.\n\nThe possible felony charge against the author is unclear. Normally, reporting a crime isn't a felony unless there's fraud. If the author is facing a charge, maybe there's a twist, like the charge being against Karen and the author being accused of something else. But based on the given info, the author acted in self-defense and reported a crime. Therefore, they are not in the wrong.\n"
