I bought my dog for $2500 so this woman might faced  felony of the fifth degree, prison term of 6-12 months, and a fine no more than $2500. This is relevant at the end.\n\nThe incident happened three months ago. I was walking my dog and it was a beautiful day. I live in a really nice neighborhood. Most of the people living in the neighborhood are young adult that really health conscious, there are a lot of restaurant offering vegan menu and there is even a vegan bistro that we love.\n\nWhen I was walking my dog in the square, I saw DxE (direct action everywhere) protesting near the park. I thought it was good, I am not a vegan but I limit my meat consumption for ethical and health reason. I was just walking my puppy. A girl, let's call her Karen, ask me \"hey beautiful pup, what kind is that\" so I said it's Golden Retriever, it just that he has a really light color. I did not know she was part of the protest, she didn't have any sign and just dress normally.\n\nKaren next response was \"oh so it's pure breed, do you know that millions of dog got gassed every year in shelter?\" at this point I felt uncomfortable and started to just walk away but she kept following me. So I told her that I know that fact but choose going through breeder route because I want specific traits in my dog and I use a reputable breeder. I was keep walking and she said that I was being selfish for going through breeder route, she asked me what did I gave to my dog, I told her none of her business and please leave me alone. Karen started to lose her shit and called me the most selfish person she ever met that I am rude and she started called me name, I was just keep walking away from her, at this point she yelled at me that I am slaving my puppy and then she grabbed the leash, pushed me and tried to run with my puppy. Worf losing it and he wanted to come to me so I was able to take back the leash, and my neighbor helped me, he saw and hear everything. It happened so quick.\n\nWe went to police car near the location, told them what happened, and Karen was so stupid she kept following me and screaming on how I enslave my puppy. I explained everything and the police arrested Karen. The police revoke the DxE protestor permit because Karen was part of them and I felt bad because the other protestor were just doing their thing and I believe in free speech. When I reported Karen, I was scared but she might actually go to Jail, maybe she was so passionate but I don't think she deserved to be in jail, idk, I am a bit torn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. So, the situation is that they were walking their dog when a vegan activist, Karen, approached them. She started talking about dogs being gassed in shelters, then argued about getting a purebred from a breeder. Things escalated when Karen grabbed the leash, pushed them, and tried to take the dog. The author reported her, leading to Karen's arrest and possible felony charges.\n\nFirst, I need to check the legality here. If Karen physically assaulted the author by pushing them and trying to take the dog, that's a criminal act. In many places, assault and battery are crimes, especially if there's an attempt to steal someone's property (the dog). The author reporting this to the police seems justified. They had a witness (their neighbor) who saw the incident, which supports their side.\n\nThe author mentions that they bought the dog for $2500 and used a reputable breeder. While their choice to buy from a breeder might be ethically debatable, in this case, they weren't doing anything illegal. Karen's actions were aggressive and potentially criminal. So, the author's actions in self-defense and protecting their property by reporting the incident don't seem wrong.\n\nHowever, there's a part where the author feels conflicted about the other protesters' free speech. They didn't target the entire group, just Karen who was acting aggressively. Since Karen was acting outside the bounds of peaceful protest by using violence, the author reporting her doesn't infringe on free speech rights. The other protesters weren't involved in the altercation.\n\nPotential issues could be if the author provoked Karen, but from the description, Karen was the one who escalated the situation. The author tried to walk away and just wanted to be left alone. The police arrested Karen based on the report, and the permit was revoked for the group because of her actions, which might be a consequence of her individual misconduct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author wasn't in the wrong for reporting a violent act. Karen's actions warranted legal action, and the author acted within their rights to protect themselves and their property.\n"
