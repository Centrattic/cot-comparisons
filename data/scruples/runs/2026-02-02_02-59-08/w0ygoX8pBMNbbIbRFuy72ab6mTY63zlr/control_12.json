I bought my dog for $2500 so this woman might faced  felony of the fifth degree, prison term of 6-12 months, and a fine no more than $2500. This is relevant at the end.\n\nThe incident happened three months ago. I was walking my dog and it was a beautiful day. I live in a really nice neighborhood. Most of the people living in the neighborhood are young adult that really health conscious, there are a lot of restaurant offering vegan menu and there is even a vegan bistro that we love.\n\nWhen I was walking my dog in the square, I saw DxE (direct action everywhere) protesting near the park. I thought it was good, I am not a vegan but I limit my meat consumption for ethical and health reason. I was just walking my puppy. A girl, let's call her Karen, ask me \"hey beautiful pup, what kind is that\" so I said it's Golden Retriever, it just that he has a really light color. I did not know she was part of the protest, she didn't have any sign and just dress normally.\n\nKaren next response was \"oh so it's pure breed, do you know that millions of dog got gassed every year in shelter?\" at this point I felt uncomfortable and started to just walk away but she kept following me. So I told her that I know that fact but choose going through breeder route because I want specific traits in my dog and I use a reputable breeder. I was keep walking and she said that I was being selfish for going through breeder route, she asked me what did I gave to my dog, I told her none of her business and please leave me alone. Karen started to lose her shit and called me the most selfish person she ever met that I am rude and she started called me name, I was just keep walking away from her, at this point she yelled at me that I am slaving my puppy and then she grabbed the leash, pushed me and tried to run with my puppy. Worf losing it and he wanted to come to me so I was able to take back the leash, and my neighbor helped me, he saw and hear everything. It happened so quick.\n\nWe went to police car near the location, told them what happened, and Karen was so stupid she kept following me and screaming on how I enslave my puppy. I explained everything and the police arrested Karen. The police revoke the DxE protestor permit because Karen was part of them and I felt bad because the other protestor were just doing their thing and I believe in free speech. When I reported Karen, I was scared but she might actually go to Jail, maybe she was so passionate but I don't think she deserved to be in jail, idk, I am a bit torn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this. The user wants to know if the person who reported the vegan activist is in the wrong. The situation involves a confrontation between the dog owner and Karen from DxE. The key points here are the sequence of events and the actions taken.\n\nFirst, the dog owner was walking their purebred Golden Retriever in a health-conscious neighborhood. Karen, part of a protest, approached and started a conversation. She then made a comment about shelter dogs and accused the owner of being selfish. The owner defended their choice of breeder. The tension escalated when Karen grabbed the leash, pushed the owner, and tried to take the dog. The owner and a neighbor intervened, leading to Karen's arrest.\n\nNow, the question is whether the owner is at fault. The owner reported the incident to the police because Karen physically assaulted them and tried to take the dog. The police revoked the protest permit, which might indicate that Karen's actions were outside the bounds of the protest. The owner's intent was to report a crime, not to target the activist group. They mentioned feeling conflicted about arresting someone for activism but prioritized their safety and their dog's well-being.\n\nPossible angles to consider: Was the protest peaceful before Karen's actions? Did Karen's behavior cross into unlawful conduct by using force? The owner's actions in reporting a crime seem justified. However, could there be a misunderstanding or overreaction? The owner might have de-escalated differently, but given the physical assault, calling the police is reasonable. The owner isn't at fault for defending themselves and their pet. The outcome (felony charge for Karen) might be a result of her actions, not the owner's intent. So, the owner isn't in the wrong here.\n"
