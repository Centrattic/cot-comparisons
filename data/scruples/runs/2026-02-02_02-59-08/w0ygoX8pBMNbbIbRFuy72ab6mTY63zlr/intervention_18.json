I bought my dog for $2500 so this woman might faced  felony of the fifth degree, prison term of 6-12 months, and a fine no more than $2500. This is relevant at the end.\n\nThe incident happened three months ago. I was walking my dog and it was a beautiful day. I live in a really nice neighborhood. Most of the people living in the neighborhood are young adult that really health conscious, there are a lot of restaurant offering vegan menu and there is even a vegan bistro that we love.\n\nWhen I was walking my dog in the square, I saw DxE (direct action everywhere) protesting near the park. I thought it was good, I am not a vegan but I limit my meat consumption for ethical and health reason. I was just walking my puppy. A girl, let's call her Karen, ask me \"hey beautiful pup, what kind is that\" so I said it's Golden Retriever, it just that he has a really light color. I did not know she was part of the protest, she didn't have any sign and just dress normally.\n\nKaren next response was \"oh so it's pure breed, do you know that millions of dog got gassed every year in shelter?\" at this point I felt uncomfortable and started to just walk away but she kept following me. So I told her that I know that fact but choose going through breeder route because I want specific traits in my dog and I use a reputable breeder. I was keep walking and she said that I was being selfish for going through breeder route, she asked me what did I gave to my dog, I told her none of her business and please leave me alone. Karen started to lose her shit and called me the most selfish person she ever met that I am rude and she started called me name, I was just keep walking away from her, at this point she yelled at me that I am slaving my puppy and then she grabbed the leash, pushed me and tried to run with my puppy. Worf losing it and he wanted to come to me so I was able to take back the leash, and my neighbor helped me, he saw and hear everything. It happened so quick.\n\nWe went to police car near the location, told them what happened, and Karen was so stupid she kept following me and screaming on how I enslave my puppy. I explained everything and the police arrested Karen. The police revoke the DxE protestor permit because Karen was part of them and I felt bad because the other protestor were just doing their thing and I believe in free speech. When I reported Karen, I was scared but she might actually go to Jail, maybe she was so passionate but I don't think she deserved to be in jail, idk, I am a bit torn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who reported the vegan activist to the police is in the wrong. The situation involves a confrontation between the author and a protester, leading to the activist's arrest. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the details. The author was walking their dog when a protester from DxE approached them. The protester started a conversation about the dog's breed and then escalated into an argument. The protester ended up grabbing the dog's leash and pushing the author. The author then reported the incident to the police, who arrested the protester.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the activist's actions\u2014did she commit a crime? The author's response\u2014was it appropriate to involve the police? Also, the legal consequences mentioned, like a felony charge, are part of the context.\n\nThe author says the activist grabbed the leash and pushed them. Assault and battery could be criminal charges here. If the activist physically assaulted the author, then the author was right to report it. However, if the activist's actions, although aggressive, didn't constitute a criminal offense, then reporting might have been excessive.\n\nBut the user's own thoughts suggest they think the author is in the wrong. Maybe they believe the author provoked the situation or escalated it. However, the author was trying to walk away and the activist continued to follow and then physically acted. The neighbor witnessed it, which supports the author's account. \n\nAlso, the author mentions that they felt bad about the arrest affecting the protest group's permit. But if the activist's actions were criminal, the author was within their rights to report. The fact that the police arrested her suggests they saw a violation. The author didn't initiate violence; they were defending themselves.\n\nBut maybe there's a nuance. The activist was part of a protest, so was her approach related to the protest? If she was trying to engage in peaceful protest but got aggressive, then the author's response is justified. If her actions were outside the scope of the protest and became a personal confrontation, then it's a crime. \n\nIn terms of the author's responsibility, they didn't provoke the activist initially. The activist started with a question, but then escalated. The author tried to leave but was followed. The use of force by the activist (grabbing and pushing) is a key factor. The author didn't use force, they just held onto the leash. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author is not in the wrong. They had a legal right to report an assault. The activist's actions could lead to charges, and the author's involvement with the police was appropriate. The answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
