I bought my dog for $2500 so this woman might faced  felony of the fifth degree, prison term of 6-12 months, and a fine no more than $2500. This is relevant at the end.\n\nThe incident happened three months ago. I was walking my dog and it was a beautiful day. I live in a really nice neighborhood. Most of the people living in the neighborhood are young adult that really health conscious, there are a lot of restaurant offering vegan menu and there is even a vegan bistro that we love.\n\nWhen I was walking my dog in the square, I saw DxE (direct action everywhere) protesting near the park. I thought it was good, I am not a vegan but I limit my meat consumption for ethical and health reason. I was just walking my puppy. A girl, let's call her Karen, ask me \"hey beautiful pup, what kind is that\" so I said it's Golden Retriever, it just that he has a really light color. I did not know she was part of the protest, she didn't have any sign and just dress normally.\n\nKaren next response was \"oh so it's pure breed, do you know that millions of dog got gassed every year in shelter?\" at this point I felt uncomfortable and started to just walk away but she kept following me. So I told her that I know that fact but choose going through breeder route because I want specific traits in my dog and I use a reputable breeder. I was keep walking and she said that I was being selfish for going through breeder route, she asked me what did I gave to my dog, I told her none of her business and please leave me alone. Karen started to lose her shit and called me the most selfish person she ever met that I am rude and she started called me name, I was just keep walking away from her, at this point she yelled at me that I am slaving my puppy and then she grabbed the leash, pushed me and tried to run with my puppy. Worf losing it and he wanted to come to me so I was able to take back the leash, and my neighbor helped me, he saw and hear everything. It happened so quick.\n\nWe went to police car near the location, told them what happened, and Karen was so stupid she kept following me and screaming on how I enslave my puppy. I explained everything and the police arrested Karen. The police revoke the DxE protestor permit because Karen was part of them and I felt bad because the other protestor were just doing their thing and I believe in free speech. When I reported Karen, I was scared but she might actually go to Jail, maybe she was so passionate but I don't think she deserved to be in jail, idk, I am a bit torn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who reported the vegan activist is in the wrong. The situation involves a confrontation between the author and a protester, leading to the activist being arrested and facing felony charges.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points from the story. The author was walking their dog when an activist approached them. The activist started a conversation about the dog's breed and then escalated by making a comment about shelter dogs. The author explains their breeder choice, but the activist becomes aggressive, calls them names, grabs the dog's leash, and tries to take the dog. The author and a neighbor intervene, leading to the activist being arrested. The police revoked the protest permit for the activist's group because of this incident.\n\nNow, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. To determine this, I need to consider the actions of both parties. The activist's behavior escalated from a conversation to physical aggression by grabbing the leash and pushing the author. That seems like a clear violation of the law, possibly assault or battery. The author's response was to report the incident to the police, which is a standard and appropriate action when someone is attacked or threatened.\n\nThe author mentions feeling torn because they believe in free speech and didn't want to harm the other protesters. However, the activist's actions were not peaceful protest; they engaged in physical confrontation. Reporting a crime, even if it affects a protest, is the right thing to do. The author was defending themselves and their dog, which justifies the report.\n\nThere's also the context of the charges: a fifth-degree felony, which is a lower-level felony. The activist's actions leading to this charge seem justified if they physically assaulted the author. The neighbor's presence as a witness supports the author's account, which is important in legal proceedings.\n\nI should consider if there were any elements of self-defense or provocation. The activist initiated the conflict by following the author, yelling, and then grabbing the leash. The author was trying to walk away, which is a reasonable attempt to de-escalate. The activist's loss of control and physical aggression is the key point here. \n\nAnother angle is the initial interaction about the dog. The activist's comment about shelter dogs might have been provocative, but it doesn't justify their subsequent actions. The author had the right to explain their breeding choice, and the activist's response escalated beyond a disagreement into harassment and physical aggression.\n\nIn terms of legal responsibility, the author is not the one who committed a crime here. They reported an assault, which is their right. The activist's actions, not the author's, led to the charges. So, the author isn't in the wrong for reporting a crime that was committed against them.\n"
