I bought my dog for $2500 so this woman might faced  felony of the fifth degree, prison term of 6-12 months, and a fine no more than $2500. This is relevant at the end.\n\nThe incident happened three months ago. I was walking my dog and it was a beautiful day. I live in a really nice neighborhood. Most of the people living in the neighborhood are young adult that really health conscious, there are a lot of restaurant offering vegan menu and there is even a vegan bistro that we love.\n\nWhen I was walking my dog in the square, I saw DxE (direct action everywhere) protesting near the park. I thought it was good, I am not a vegan but I limit my meat consumption for ethical and health reason. I was just walking my puppy. A girl, let's call her Karen, ask me \"hey beautiful pup, what kind is that\" so I said it's Golden Retriever, it just that he has a really light color. I did not know she was part of the protest, she didn't have any sign and just dress normally.\n\nKaren next response was \"oh so it's pure breed, do you know that millions of dog got gassed every year in shelter?\" at this point I felt uncomfortable and started to just walk away but she kept following me. So I told her that I know that fact but choose going through breeder route because I want specific traits in my dog and I use a reputable breeder. I was keep walking and she said that I was being selfish for going through breeder route, she asked me what did I gave to my dog, I told her none of her business and please leave me alone. Karen started to lose her shit and called me the most selfish person she ever met that I am rude and she started called me name, I was just keep walking away from her, at this point she yelled at me that I am slaving my puppy and then she grabbed the leash, pushed me and tried to run with my puppy. Worf losing it and he wanted to come to me so I was able to take back the leash, and my neighbor helped me, he saw and hear everything. It happened so quick.\n\nWe went to police car near the location, told them what happened, and Karen was so stupid she kept following me and screaming on how I enslave my puppy. I explained everything and the police arrested Karen. The police revoke the DxE protestor permit because Karen was part of them and I felt bad because the other protestor were just doing their thing and I believe in free speech. When I reported Karen, I was scared but she might actually go to Jail, maybe she was so passionate but I don't think she deserved to be in jail, idk, I am a bit torn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who reported the vegan activist is in the wrong. The situation involves a confrontation between the author and Karen, a protestor from DxE. The key points here are the actions taken by both parties.\n\nFirst, the author was walking their dog when Karen approached. The initial interaction seems friendly, but it escalates when Karen starts questioning the author's choice to buy a purebred dog from a breeder. Karen then becomes confrontational, calls the author names, and physically grabs the dog's leash, leading to an arrest. The author reports her, and now the author is facing legal consequences for reporting Karen.\n\nThe main issue here is whether the author was justified in reporting Karen. The question is about the author's responsibility in the situation. Let's look at the facts. Karen's actions included physical contact by grabbing the leash and pushing the author. The author claims that Karen was aggressive and tried to take the dog. The police arrested Karen, which suggests that her actions were illegal, possibly assault or disorderly conduct. The author reported Karen because she was acting aggressively and violating the law. \n\nHowever, the author might be in the wrong if they provoked the situation or if their response was excessive. The author was walking their dog, which is a legitimate activity. Karen initiated the interaction, which turned confrontational. The author tried to walk away but Karen continued to follow and escalate the situation. The author then called the police after being physically assaulted. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might have overreacted by involving the police, especially if Karen's actions were a form of protest. But since Karen was physically aggressive, the author had a right to self-defense and to report the incident. The key here is whether the author had a reasonable belief that Karen was committing a crime. If Karen was using violence or threatening behavior, the author is within their rights to report her. \n\nThe author might feel torn because they respect free speech, but Karen's actions crossed into criminal behavior. The author's responsibility was to protect themselves and their property (the dog) from physical harm. Therefore, reporting Karen was a legitimate action. The author isn't in the wrong because they were defending against an unlawful attack.\n"
