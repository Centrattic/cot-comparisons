I bought my dog for $2500 so this woman might faced  felony of the fifth degree, prison term of 6-12 months, and a fine no more than $2500. This is relevant at the end.\n\nThe incident happened three months ago. I was walking my dog and it was a beautiful day. I live in a really nice neighborhood. Most of the people living in the neighborhood are young adult that really health conscious, there are a lot of restaurant offering vegan menu and there is even a vegan bistro that we love.\n\nWhen I was walking my dog in the square, I saw DxE (direct action everywhere) protesting near the park. I thought it was good, I am not a vegan but I limit my meat consumption for ethical and health reason. I was just walking my puppy. A girl, let's call her Karen, ask me \"hey beautiful pup, what kind is that\" so I said it's Golden Retriever, it just that he has a really light color. I did not know she was part of the protest, she didn't have any sign and just dress normally.\n\nKaren next response was \"oh so it's pure breed, do you know that millions of dog got gassed every year in shelter?\" at this point I felt uncomfortable and started to just walk away but she kept following me. So I told her that I know that fact but choose going through breeder route because I want specific traits in my dog and I use a reputable breeder. I was keep walking and she said that I was being selfish for going through breeder route, she asked me what did I gave to my dog, I told her none of her business and please leave me alone. Karen started to lose her shit and called me the most selfish person she ever met that I am rude and she started called me name, I was just keep walking away from her, at this point she yelled at me that I am slaving my puppy and then she grabbed the leash, pushed me and tried to run with my puppy. Worf losing it and he wanted to come to me so I was able to take back the leash, and my neighbor helped me, he saw and hear everything. It happened so quick.\n\nWe went to police car near the location, told them what happened, and Karen was so stupid she kept following me and screaming on how I enslave my puppy. I explained everything and the police arrested Karen. The police revoke the DxE protestor permit because Karen was part of them and I felt bad because the other protestor were just doing their thing and I believe in free speech. When I reported Karen, I was scared but she might actually go to Jail, maybe she was so passionate but I don't think she deserved to be in jail, idk, I am a bit torn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author here is in the wrong. So the situation is about reporting a vegan activist to the police, which led to her arrest and facing a felony charge. The user is asking if they're in the wrong (AITA).\n\nFirst, let me break down the events. The author was walking their dog when a woman from a protest group, DxE, approached. They had a conversation where the woman criticized the author's choice of buying a purebred dog from a breeder, mentioning shelters and gassing dogs. The conversation escalated, the woman grabbed the dog's leash, pushed the author, and tried to take the dog. The author then reported her to the police, leading to her arrest. Now, the author is facing a court case and possible charges themselves.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the woman's actions (aggression, grabbing the leash, pushing), the author's response (reporting her), and the legal consequences.\n\nThe user's question is whether the author is in the wrong. I need to consider the legality of the situation. If the woman physically assaulted the author by pushing and grabbing the leash, then that's a criminal act\u2014battery or assault. In that case, reporting her is justified because it's a crime. However, sometimes there's nuance. For example, if the woman was just verbally aggressive but didn't commit a physical crime, then calling the police might be overreacting. But in this case, the woman not only yelled but also physically grabbed the leash and pushed, which is a clear act of aggression.\n\nAnother angle is whether the author provoked the situation. The woman brought up the topic of dog shelters, but the author was walking away and trying to disengage. The woman followed and escalated it with personal attacks and physical actions. The author didn't provoke the physical assault; the woman did. Therefore, the author's reaction of calling the police and reporting her seems appropriate.\n\nAlso, the author mentions feeling bad because other protesters were just doing their thing, implying they didn't want to target all of them. The author might have felt that reporting was necessary due to the physical assault, not just the verbal conflict. \n\nBut the user is concerned about being in the wrong. Could there be a reason to think the author overreacted? For example, if the woman's actions were considered protected speech or if the author's intent to report her was based on the verbal confrontation rather than the physical assault. However, the police arrested the woman, which suggests they saw it as a crime, not just a disagreement. Also, the author has a court date, but maybe the charges are against the woman, not the author. The author is worried about facing a felony charge, but that's unclear. The initial report by the author led to the woman's arrest, so maybe the author is not the one being charged here. Wait, the user says \"facing felony charge now\" but it's the woman who's facing charges. The author might be facing some legal issue, but the main question is about the author's actions in reporting.\n\nIn terms of ethics, even if the woman was part of a protest group, her physical aggression is not protected speech. The author had the right to protect themselves and their dog. Reporting a crime is not in the wrong. However, sometimes people might argue that the author should have handled it differently, like walking away more firmly, but when physical violence occurs, it's appropriate to involve law enforcement.\n\nAnother possible consideration: the author's mention of the dog's cost ($2500) and the potential fine for the woman. This could imply that the author had a motive beyond just the violence, but that's speculative. However, the main issue is the physical assault, which is separate from the cost of the dog.\n\nIn summary, the woman committed an assault, and the author reported it. Unless there's evidence that the author provoked the woman or lied to the police, the author's actions seem justified. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
