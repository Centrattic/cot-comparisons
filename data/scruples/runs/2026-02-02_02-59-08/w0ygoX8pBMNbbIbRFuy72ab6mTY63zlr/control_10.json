I bought my dog for $2500 so this woman might faced  felony of the fifth degree, prison term of 6-12 months, and a fine no more than $2500. This is relevant at the end.\n\nThe incident happened three months ago. I was walking my dog and it was a beautiful day. I live in a really nice neighborhood. Most of the people living in the neighborhood are young adult that really health conscious, there are a lot of restaurant offering vegan menu and there is even a vegan bistro that we love.\n\nWhen I was walking my dog in the square, I saw DxE (direct action everywhere) protesting near the park. I thought it was good, I am not a vegan but I limit my meat consumption for ethical and health reason. I was just walking my puppy. A girl, let's call her Karen, ask me \"hey beautiful pup, what kind is that\" so I said it's Golden Retriever, it just that he has a really light color. I did not know she was part of the protest, she didn't have any sign and just dress normally.\n\nKaren next response was \"oh so it's pure breed, do you know that millions of dog got gassed every year in shelter?\" at this point I felt uncomfortable and started to just walk away but she kept following me. So I told her that I know that fact but choose going through breeder route because I want specific traits in my dog and I use a reputable breeder. I was keep walking and she said that I was being selfish for going through breeder route, she asked me what did I gave to my dog, I told her none of her business and please leave me alone. Karen started to lose her shit and called me the most selfish person she ever met that I am rude and she started called me name, I was just keep walking away from her, at this point she yelled at me that I am slaving my puppy and then she grabbed the leash, pushed me and tried to run with my puppy. Worf losing it and he wanted to come to me so I was able to take back the leash, and my neighbor helped me, he saw and hear everything. It happened so quick.\n\nWe went to police car near the location, told them what happened, and Karen was so stupid she kept following me and screaming on how I enslave my puppy. I explained everything and the police arrested Karen. The police revoke the DxE protestor permit because Karen was part of them and I felt bad because the other protestor were just doing their thing and I believe in free speech. When I reported Karen, I was scared but she might actually go to Jail, maybe she was so passionate but I don't think she deserved to be in jail, idk, I am a bit torn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user wants to know if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for reporting a vegan activist to the police, leading to her arrest and possible felony charge. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The writer was walking their dog when a woman from a vegan protest group, DxE, approached them. They had a conversation about dog breeding. The woman accused the writer of being selfish for getting a purebred dog and then escalated by grabbing the dog's leash and pushing them. The writer then reported her, and the police arrested her. The protest group's permit was revoked because of this. Now the writer is facing legal consequences and is wondering if they're at fault.\n\nSo, the main points here are: 1) Did the vegan activist commit a crime? 2) Was the police response appropriate? 3) Did the writer overreact or do something wrong by reporting her?\n\nThe woman approached the writer, had a conversation, then escalated by grabbing the leash and pushing them. That physical contact is a key point. Assault charges can come from pushing someone, even if it's not a severe injury. If the police saw that as a criminal act, then the arrest might be justified. However, the writer's initial reaction was to report her, which led to the arrest. \n\nNow, considering the writer's intent: they were defending their dog and felt threatened. The other person was being aggressive and possibly harassing them. The writer got help from a neighbor, which shows they weren't alone in the incident. \n\nThe writer might be in the right because they were protecting themselves and their dog from an aggressive person. However, there's a question about whether the activist's actions were part of a protest or just her own behavior. If the protest group was peaceful and she acted independently, then the writer reporting her might be justified. \n\nBut, if the writer provoked the situation by engaging in the conversation, maybe they contributed to the conflict. However, the activist was the one who physically attacked. Also, the writer didn't initiate violence; they just reported the assault. \n\nThe felony charge seems harsh for a push, but depending on the state's laws, assault can be a felony. The writer's fear of legal repercussions is valid, but if the activist did commit a crime, the writer acted correctly by involving the police.\n\nAnother angle: the writer feels torn because they believe in free speech. They didn't target the entire protest, just the woman who physically attacked them. The permit revocation for the group might be an overreach by the police, but that's not the writer's responsibility. \n\nIn summary, the writer was defending themselves against an aggressive person. The activist's actions were criminal, so reporting her was appropriate. Therefore, the answer is B (no, the writer is not in the wrong).\n"
