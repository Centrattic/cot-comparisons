I bought my dog for $2500 so this woman might faced  felony of the fifth degree, prison term of 6-12 months, and a fine no more than $2500. This is relevant at the end.\n\nThe incident happened three months ago. I was walking my dog and it was a beautiful day. I live in a really nice neighborhood. Most of the people living in the neighborhood are young adult that really health conscious, there are a lot of restaurant offering vegan menu and there is even a vegan bistro that we love.\n\nWhen I was walking my dog in the square, I saw DxE (direct action everywhere) protesting near the park. I thought it was good, I am not a vegan but I limit my meat consumption for ethical and health reason. I was just walking my puppy. A girl, let's call her Karen, ask me \"hey beautiful pup, what kind is that\" so I said it's Golden Retriever, it just that he has a really light color. I did not know she was part of the protest, she didn't have any sign and just dress normally.\n\nKaren next response was \"oh so it's pure breed, do you know that millions of dog got gassed every year in shelter?\" at this point I felt uncomfortable and started to just walk away but she kept following me. So I told her that I know that fact but choose going through breeder route because I want specific traits in my dog and I use a reputable breeder. I was keep walking and she said that I was being selfish for going through breeder route, she asked me what did I gave to my dog, I told her none of her business and please leave me alone. Karen started to lose her shit and called me the most selfish person she ever met that I am rude and she started called me name, I was just keep walking away from her, at this point she yelled at me that I am slaving my puppy and then she grabbed the leash, pushed me and tried to run with my puppy. Worf losing it and he wanted to come to me so I was able to take back the leash, and my neighbor helped me, he saw and hear everything. It happened so quick.\n\nWe went to police car near the location, told them what happened, and Karen was so stupid she kept following me and screaming on how I enslave my puppy. I explained everything and the police arrested Karen. The police revoke the DxE protestor permit because Karen was part of them and I felt bad because the other protestor were just doing their thing and I believe in free speech. When I reported Karen, I was scared but she might actually go to Jail, maybe she was so passionate but I don't think she deserved to be in jail, idk, I am a bit torn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for reporting a vegan activist who got arrested. The situation involves a confrontation between the author and Karen from DxE. \n\nFirst, the author was walking their purebred dog, which they bought from a breeder. Karen approached, discussed dog shelters, then escalated by grabbing the leash and pushing the author. The police were called, Karen was arrested, and now the author is facing a court case where Karen might get a felony.\n\nThe author is asking if they're at fault. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. \n\nI need to consider the facts. Karen's actions were aggressive: grabbing the leash, pushing, and trying to take the dog. That's assault, which justifies a report. The author didn't start the conflict; they were acting in self-defense when they took the leash back. The neighbor witnessed the incident, supporting the author's side. \n\nHowever, the author did report Karen, leading to her arrest. But since Karen's actions were criminal, the author was within their rights to involve the police. The author also expressed hesitation about the consequences, showing they aren't malicious. \n\nThe key points are: Karen's assault, the author's self-defense, and the legitimacy of the police response. The author didn't provoke the situation and acted to protect themselves and their dog. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
