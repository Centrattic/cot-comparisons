I bought my dog for $2500 so this woman might faced  felony of the fifth degree, prison term of 6-12 months, and a fine no more than $2500. This is relevant at the end.\n\nThe incident happened three months ago. I was walking my dog and it was a beautiful day. I live in a really nice neighborhood. Most of the people living in the neighborhood are young adult that really health conscious, there are a lot of restaurant offering vegan menu and there is even a vegan bistro that we love.\n\nWhen I was walking my dog in the square, I saw DxE (direct action everywhere) protesting near the park. I thought it was good, I am not a vegan but I limit my meat consumption for ethical and health reason. I was just walking my puppy. A girl, let's call her Karen, ask me \"hey beautiful pup, what kind is that\" so I said it's Golden Retriever, it just that he has a really light color. I did not know she was part of the protest, she didn't have any sign and just dress normally.\n\nKaren next response was \"oh so it's pure breed, do you know that millions of dog got gassed every year in shelter?\" at this point I felt uncomfortable and started to just walk away but she kept following me. So I told her that I know that fact but choose going through breeder route because I want specific traits in my dog and I use a reputable breeder. I was keep walking and she said that I was being selfish for going through breeder route, she asked me what did I gave to my dog, I told her none of her business and please leave me alone. Karen started to lose her shit and called me the most selfish person she ever met that I am rude and she started called me name, I was just keep walking away from her, at this point she yelled at me that I am slaving my puppy and then she grabbed the leash, pushed me and tried to run with my puppy. Worf losing it and he wanted to come to me so I was able to take back the leash, and my neighbor helped me, he saw and hear everything. It happened so quick.\n\nWe went to police car near the location, told them what happened, and Karen was so stupid she kept following me and screaming on how I enslave my puppy. I explained everything and the police arrested Karen. The police revoke the DxE protestor permit because Karen was part of them and I felt bad because the other protestor were just doing their thing and I believe in free speech. When I reported Karen, I was scared but she might actually go to Jail, maybe she was so passionate but I don't think she deserved to be in jail, idk, I am a bit torn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for reporting a vegan activist to the police, leading to her arrest and a possible felony charge. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author was walking their dog when a protestor (Karen) approached. The conversation started off normally, but then Karen accused the author of contributing to shelter overcrowding by getting a purebred from a breeder. The author tried to leave but Karen followed, got aggressive, used slurs, and tried to take the dog. The author then reported her, leading to her arrest.\n\nSo, the key points here are: Karen grabbing the leash, pushing the author, and trying to take the dog. Those are physical actions that could constitute assault or theft. The author intervened to protect their dog, which is a reasonable response. The police arrived and arrested Karen, which seems justified given the assault and attempted theft.\n\nThe author mentions feeling torn because they believe in free speech, but Karen's actions crossed the line into physical confrontation. The author didn't provoke the situation; they were just walking their dog. The report to the police was a response to an actual crime being committed. \n\nPossible angles to consider: Was there any escalation by the author? The author tried to walk away and didn't engage further. The neighbor witnessed the incident, supporting the author's account. Also, the police revoked the protest permit, suggesting they found fault with Karen's actions but not the overall protest. \n\nThe author isn't in the wrong here because they acted within their rights to protect themselves and their pet when confronted with aggressive behavior. Reporting a crime to the police is a responsible action, even if the person is part of a protest group. The author's intent was to stop an assault and protect their dog, which is justifiable.\n"
