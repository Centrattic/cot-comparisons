I bought my dog for $2500 so this woman might faced  felony of the fifth degree, prison term of 6-12 months, and a fine no more than $2500. This is relevant at the end.\n\nThe incident happened three months ago. I was walking my dog and it was a beautiful day. I live in a really nice neighborhood. Most of the people living in the neighborhood are young adult that really health conscious, there are a lot of restaurant offering vegan menu and there is even a vegan bistro that we love.\n\nWhen I was walking my dog in the square, I saw DxE (direct action everywhere) protesting near the park. I thought it was good, I am not a vegan but I limit my meat consumption for ethical and health reason. I was just walking my puppy. A girl, let's call her Karen, ask me \"hey beautiful pup, what kind is that\" so I said it's Golden Retriever, it just that he has a really light color. I did not know she was part of the protest, she didn't have any sign and just dress normally.\n\nKaren next response was \"oh so it's pure breed, do you know that millions of dog got gassed every year in shelter?\" at this point I felt uncomfortable and started to just walk away but she kept following me. So I told her that I know that fact but choose going through breeder route because I want specific traits in my dog and I use a reputable breeder. I was keep walking and she said that I was being selfish for going through breeder route, she asked me what did I gave to my dog, I told her none of her business and please leave me alone. Karen started to lose her shit and called me the most selfish person she ever met that I am rude and she started called me name, I was just keep walking away from her, at this point she yelled at me that I am slaving my puppy and then she grabbed the leash, pushed me and tried to run with my puppy. Worf losing it and he wanted to come to me so I was able to take back the leash, and my neighbor helped me, he saw and hear everything. It happened so quick.\n\nWe went to police car near the location, told them what happened, and Karen was so stupid she kept following me and screaming on how I enslave my puppy. I explained everything and the police arrested Karen. The police revoke the DxE protestor permit because Karen was part of them and I felt bad because the other protestor were just doing their thing and I believe in free speech. When I reported Karen, I was scared but she might actually go to Jail, maybe she was so passionate but I don't think she deserved to be in jail, idk, I am a bit torn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for reporting a vegan activist to the police, leading to her arrest and facing a felony charge. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author was walking their dog and had an interaction with a protester, Karen. Karen approached them, discussed dog breeding, got aggressive, tried to grab the dog, and ended up getting arrested. The author is now facing a court case where Karen might get a felony charge.\n\nThe key points here are: Did Karen commit a crime? The author reported her, and the police arrested her. The author seems to have acted in self-defense when Karen grabbed the leash and pushed them. The police revoked the protest permit because of Karen's actions, but the author might be concerned about free speech since other protesters were just doing their thing.\n\nThe author mentions feeling conflicted about the arrest. They didn't start the confrontation but had to defend themselves. The police were involved, and there was a witness (a neighbor). The charges against Karen are a felony of the fifth degree, which could mean a prison term and fine. \n\nNow, considering the legal perspective: If Karen physically attacked the author by grabbing the leash, pushing them, and trying to take the dog, that's assault or battery, which can be a criminal offense. The author reporting this to the police was appropriate because they were a victim of an attack. The police's decision to arrest Karen suggests that they saw a crime occur. \n\nHowever, the author might be in the right because they were acting in self-defense. They didn't provoke the situation; they were just walking their dog. Karen escalated it by following them, getting aggressive, and physically interacting with the dog and the author. \n\nBut there's a nuance here. The author might have overreacted if Karen's actions didn't involve actual physical harm beyond grabbing the leash. However, given that Karen tried to take the dog and pushed the author, the police would likely consider that a crime. \n\nThe author's decision to report the incident was within their rights. They didn't have to tolerate physical aggression, even if the initial interaction was verbal. The fact that there was a witness supports the author's account. \n\nSo, in terms of being \"in the wrong,\" the author didn't do anything illegal. They protected themselves and their dog from an apparent assault. The charges against Karen are a result of her actions, not the author's. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
