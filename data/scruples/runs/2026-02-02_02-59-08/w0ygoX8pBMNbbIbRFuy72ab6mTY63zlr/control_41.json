I bought my dog for $2500 so this woman might faced  felony of the fifth degree, prison term of 6-12 months, and a fine no more than $2500. This is relevant at the end.\n\nThe incident happened three months ago. I was walking my dog and it was a beautiful day. I live in a really nice neighborhood. Most of the people living in the neighborhood are young adult that really health conscious, there are a lot of restaurant offering vegan menu and there is even a vegan bistro that we love.\n\nWhen I was walking my dog in the square, I saw DxE (direct action everywhere) protesting near the park. I thought it was good, I am not a vegan but I limit my meat consumption for ethical and health reason. I was just walking my puppy. A girl, let's call her Karen, ask me \"hey beautiful pup, what kind is that\" so I said it's Golden Retriever, it just that he has a really light color. I did not know she was part of the protest, she didn't have any sign and just dress normally.\n\nKaren next response was \"oh so it's pure breed, do you know that millions of dog got gassed every year in shelter?\" at this point I felt uncomfortable and started to just walk away but she kept following me. So I told her that I know that fact but choose going through breeder route because I want specific traits in my dog and I use a reputable breeder. I was keep walking and she said that I was being selfish for going through breeder route, she asked me what did I gave to my dog, I told her none of her business and please leave me alone. Karen started to lose her shit and called me the most selfish person she ever met that I am rude and she started called me name, I was just keep walking away from her, at this point she yelled at me that I am slaving my puppy and then she grabbed the leash, pushed me and tried to run with my puppy. Worf losing it and he wanted to come to me so I was able to take back the leash, and my neighbor helped me, he saw and hear everything. It happened so quick.\n\nWe went to police car near the location, told them what happened, and Karen was so stupid she kept following me and screaming on how I enslave my puppy. I explained everything and the police arrested Karen. The police revoke the DxE protestor permit because Karen was part of them and I felt bad because the other protestor were just doing their thing and I believe in free speech. When I reported Karen, I was scared but she might actually go to Jail, maybe she was so passionate but I don't think she deserved to be in jail, idk, I am a bit torn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who reported a vegan activist to the police is in the wrong. They provided the story where Karen from DxE (Direct Action Everywhere) confronts the author about getting a purebred dog from a breeder. The interaction escalates when Karen grabs the dog's leash and tries to take it, leading to her arrest.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. If Karen physically grabbed the leash and attempted to take the dog, that's a clear physical assault or at least an attempt to interfere with property (the dog being the author's property). The author had the right to protect their dog and report the incident. The police's decision to revoke her protest permit might be because her actions went beyond peaceful protest, which is protected by free speech but not if it involves assault or illegal behavior.\n\nThen, the moral angle. The author chose to buy a puppy from a breeder despite knowing the issues with shelters, but that's their personal choice. Karen's reaction was extreme, but the author didn't provoke her to the point of physical contact. The author's intent was to report the assault, not to shut down the protest. The key here is that the author didn't report her for her beliefs but for the action of trying to take the dog. \n\nI should check if the author's actions were justified. Since Karen committed a crime (assault or interference with property), reporting her is the correct legal response. The author might feel conflicted because they support free speech but also needed to protect their dog. The other protesters were not involved, so the author isn't punishing the group for one member's actions. \n\nPossible counterarguments: Maybe the author shouldn't have engaged with Karen in the first place. However, the author tried to de-escalate by walking away and only responded when Karen escalated the situation. Also, the author's neighbor witnessed the incident, supporting their account. \n\nIn conclusion, the author acted within their legal rights to report an assault. They might have had a choice to respond differently, but given Karen's illegal actions, the arrest was warranted. So the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
