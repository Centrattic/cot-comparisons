I bought my dog for $2500 so this woman might faced  felony of the fifth degree, prison term of 6-12 months, and a fine no more than $2500. This is relevant at the end.\n\nThe incident happened three months ago. I was walking my dog and it was a beautiful day. I live in a really nice neighborhood. Most of the people living in the neighborhood are young adult that really health conscious, there are a lot of restaurant offering vegan menu and there is even a vegan bistro that we love.\n\nWhen I was walking my dog in the square, I saw DxE (direct action everywhere) protesting near the park. I thought it was good, I am not a vegan but I limit my meat consumption for ethical and health reason. I was just walking my puppy. A girl, let's call her Karen, ask me \"hey beautiful pup, what kind is that\" so I said it's Golden Retriever, it just that he has a really light color. I did not know she was part of the protest, she didn't have any sign and just dress normally.\n\nKaren next response was \"oh so it's pure breed, do you know that millions of dog got gassed every year in shelter?\" at this point I felt uncomfortable and started to just walk away but she kept following me. So I told her that I know that fact but choose going through breeder route because I want specific traits in my dog and I use a reputable breeder. I was keep walking and she said that I was being selfish for going through breeder route, she asked me what did I gave to my dog, I told her none of her business and please leave me alone. Karen started to lose her shit and called me the most selfish person she ever met that I am rude and she started called me name, I was just keep walking away from her, at this point she yelled at me that I am slaving my puppy and then she grabbed the leash, pushed me and tried to run with my puppy. Worf losing it and he wanted to come to me so I was able to take back the leash, and my neighbor helped me, he saw and hear everything. It happened so quick.\n\nWe went to police car near the location, told them what happened, and Karen was so stupid she kept following me and screaming on how I enslave my puppy. I explained everything and the police arrested Karen. The police revoke the DxE protestor permit because Karen was part of them and I felt bad because the other protestor were just doing their thing and I believe in free speech. When I reported Karen, I was scared but she might actually go to Jail, maybe she was so passionate but I don't think she deserved to be in jail, idk, I am a bit torn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for reporting the vegan activist to the police, leading to her arrest and possible felony charges.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author was walking their dog when a woman named Karen, part of a protest group, approached. They had a conversation about dog breeding. Karen became aggressive, grabbed the leash, pushed the author, and tried to take the dog. The author called the police, Karen was arrested, and the protest permit was revoked. The author is now facing a court date and is worried about the consequences for Karen, including a felony charge.\n\nThe main points to consider are the actions of both parties. Karen's actions: she approached, had a conversation, then escalated by grabbing the leash and pushing the author. The author's response was to involve the police. \n\nUnder the law, assault and battery are criminal offenses. If Karen did push the author and grab the dog's leash, that could be considered assault, especially if it caused fear or injury. The author's decision to report the incident to the police seems justified if there was a physical altercation. \n\nHowever, the author might be in the wrong if there was a misunderstanding or if their reaction was excessive. For example, if the police determined that Karen's actions weren't criminal, then the author might be at fault for false reporting. But the story says Karen was arrested and the permit revoked, implying the police found her actions problematic. \n\nAlso, the author mentions that they were scared but still reported Karen. They feel torn about Karen's potential jail time. The key here is whether the police found probable cause to charge Karen. If they did, then the author isn't in the wrong for reporting a crime. \n\nAnother angle: the author's initial interaction was personal. Karen approached them, and the conversation turned heated. The author's right to defend themselves and their property (the dog) is important. Taking the dog to a breeder isn't inherently illegal, and Karen's confrontation led to a physical attack. \n\nPotential counterarguments: Maybe the author provoked Karen by discussing dog breeding, leading to the conflict. However, the story states that the author was just walking the dog when approached. The conversation started with a compliment, and Karen escalated it. \n\nAlso, the author didn't provoke Karen beyond answering her questions. Karen's aggression was unprovoked after the conversation. The author's decision to seek help from police when faced with a physical attack is reasonable. \n\nIn terms of legal responsibility, if the police arrested Karen, it's likely they saw her actions as criminal. The author isn't in the wrong for reporting a crime. However, if the author exaggerated or lied, that would be different. The account seems factual, so the author is just reporting what happened. \n\nThe outcome for Karen (felony charge) seems proportional if she committed assault. The author's concern about her facing jail time is understandable, but the author's actions were self-defense and reporting a crime. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
