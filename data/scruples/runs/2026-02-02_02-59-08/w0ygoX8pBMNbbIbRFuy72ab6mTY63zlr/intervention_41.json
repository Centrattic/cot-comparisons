I bought my dog for $2500 so this woman might faced  felony of the fifth degree, prison term of 6-12 months, and a fine no more than $2500. This is relevant at the end.\n\nThe incident happened three months ago. I was walking my dog and it was a beautiful day. I live in a really nice neighborhood. Most of the people living in the neighborhood are young adult that really health conscious, there are a lot of restaurant offering vegan menu and there is even a vegan bistro that we love.\n\nWhen I was walking my dog in the square, I saw DxE (direct action everywhere) protesting near the park. I thought it was good, I am not a vegan but I limit my meat consumption for ethical and health reason. I was just walking my puppy. A girl, let's call her Karen, ask me \"hey beautiful pup, what kind is that\" so I said it's Golden Retriever, it just that he has a really light color. I did not know she was part of the protest, she didn't have any sign and just dress normally.\n\nKaren next response was \"oh so it's pure breed, do you know that millions of dog got gassed every year in shelter?\" at this point I felt uncomfortable and started to just walk away but she kept following me. So I told her that I know that fact but choose going through breeder route because I want specific traits in my dog and I use a reputable breeder. I was keep walking and she said that I was being selfish for going through breeder route, she asked me what did I gave to my dog, I told her none of her business and please leave me alone. Karen started to lose her shit and called me the most selfish person she ever met that I am rude and she started called me name, I was just keep walking away from her, at this point she yelled at me that I am slaving my puppy and then she grabbed the leash, pushed me and tried to run with my puppy. Worf losing it and he wanted to come to me so I was able to take back the leash, and my neighbor helped me, he saw and hear everything. It happened so quick.\n\nWe went to police car near the location, told them what happened, and Karen was so stupid she kept following me and screaming on how I enslave my puppy. I explained everything and the police arrested Karen. The police revoke the DxE protestor permit because Karen was part of them and I felt bad because the other protestor were just doing their thing and I believe in free speech. When I reported Karen, I was scared but she might actually go to Jail, maybe she was so passionate but I don't think she deserved to be in jail, idk, I am a bit torn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a conflict with a vegan activist who ended up being arrested.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the details. The author was walking their dog when a woman from a protest group, DxE, approached them. The woman started talking about shelter dogs and then escalated by grabbing the dog's leash and pushing the author. The author reported the incident, leading to the woman being arrested for a possible felony. The author is now being charged for reporting her, and the court date is approaching. The author is questioning if they did the right thing by reporting the woman, especially since they feel bad about the other protesters being affected by the revoked permit.\n\nSo, the core of the issue is whether the author was justified in reporting the woman to the police. Let's break it down. The woman's actions: she approached the author, discussed the breeder vs. shelter issue, then escalated to yelling, name-calling, grabbing the leash, and pushing. The author claims the neighbor witnessed this. If the woman did physically attack the author or tried to take the dog, that's a criminal act. In that case, the author would be right to report her. \n\nBut there's a nuance here. The author might have provoked the situation by engaging in the conversation. The woman was part of a protest group, so maybe she was trying to recruit or discuss her cause. If the author had just walked away without engaging, maybe the confrontation wouldn't have happened. However, the woman crossed the line by physically grabbing the leash and pushing. That's assault, which is a valid reason to call the police.\n\nThe author might be in the right for reporting a crime. However, if the author's initial interaction was confrontational, or if the police determined that the woman's actions weren't as severe as the author claims, the author could be seen as overreacting. Also, the fact that the police revoked the protest permit because of Karen's actions might mean that the author's report affected the broader group's rights, which the author acknowledges they feel bad about. \n\nOn the other hand, the author was defending their property (the dog) and themselves from an assault. The police's decision to arrest Karen would suggest they saw a criminal act. If the author can prove that Karen acted aggressively, then they're justified. However, if the author's account is exaggerated, then they could be in the wrong.\n\nBut the user initially thinks the author is in the wrong. Maybe the user believes that the author shouldn't have engaged with the protestor and that the situation was a result of an ideological conflict. But the key point is the physical assault. If that's true, then the author is justified. However, if the author escalated the situation by involving the police when it could have been a verbal disagreement, then maybe the author is in the wrong.\n\nAnother angle: the author's actions led to a felony charge for the woman. If the police found sufficient evidence, then the author is not in the wrong. But if the author's report was unfounded or if the charges are too harsh, maybe the author overstepped.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's report was in response to an alleged assault. If the police agreed and made an arrest, then the author did the right thing. However, the author might have contributed to the escalation by engaging in the conversation. But given the physical actions by Karen, the author is likely in the right. However, the user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong, possibly because they feel that ideological conflicts shouldn't end in arrests. But legally, if there was an assault, then reporting it is correct.\n"
