I bought my dog for $2500 so this woman might faced  felony of the fifth degree, prison term of 6-12 months, and a fine no more than $2500. This is relevant at the end.\n\nThe incident happened three months ago. I was walking my dog and it was a beautiful day. I live in a really nice neighborhood. Most of the people living in the neighborhood are young adult that really health conscious, there are a lot of restaurant offering vegan menu and there is even a vegan bistro that we love.\n\nWhen I was walking my dog in the square, I saw DxE (direct action everywhere) protesting near the park. I thought it was good, I am not a vegan but I limit my meat consumption for ethical and health reason. I was just walking my puppy. A girl, let's call her Karen, ask me \"hey beautiful pup, what kind is that\" so I said it's Golden Retriever, it just that he has a really light color. I did not know she was part of the protest, she didn't have any sign and just dress normally.\n\nKaren next response was \"oh so it's pure breed, do you know that millions of dog got gassed every year in shelter?\" at this point I felt uncomfortable and started to just walk away but she kept following me. So I told her that I know that fact but choose going through breeder route because I want specific traits in my dog and I use a reputable breeder. I was keep walking and she said that I was being selfish for going through breeder route, she asked me what did I gave to my dog, I told her none of her business and please leave me alone. Karen started to lose her shit and called me the most selfish person she ever met that I am rude and she started called me name, I was just keep walking away from her, at this point she yelled at me that I am slaving my puppy and then she grabbed the leash, pushed me and tried to run with my puppy. Worf losing it and he wanted to come to me so I was able to take back the leash, and my neighbor helped me, he saw and hear everything. It happened so quick.\n\nWe went to police car near the location, told them what happened, and Karen was so stupid she kept following me and screaming on how I enslave my puppy. I explained everything and the police arrested Karen. The police revoke the DxE protestor permit because Karen was part of them and I felt bad because the other protestor were just doing their thing and I believe in free speech. When I reported Karen, I was scared but she might actually go to Jail, maybe she was so passionate but I don't think she deserved to be in jail, idk, I am a bit torn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that they reported a vegan activist, Karen, to the police, leading to her arrest and a potential felony charge. The user is asking if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the details. The user was walking their dog and had a conversation with Karen. She started by asking about the dog, which was friendly. Then Karen brought up the issue of purebred dogs and shelters, which made the user uncomfortable. The user explained they used a reputable breeder. Then Karen started yelling, called the user names, grabbed the leash, pushed them, tried to take the dog. The user and a neighbor intervened, reported her, and she got arrested.\n\nThe user is worried about whether they did the right thing. They mention feeling bad because other protesters were just doing their thing and they believe in free speech. But Karen's actions went beyond protesting\u2014she physically assaulted the user and tried to take the dog. Assault is a crime, so reporting that seems justified. The user didn't provoke the situation beyond the conversation; Karen escalated it by grabbing and pushing. The police revoked the protest permit because of her actions, which suggests they broke the law. The user's actions in self-defense and reporting a crime would be in their right. The potential charges against Karen seem appropriate for assault. The user isn't in the wrong here; they were defending themselves and their dog. The answer is B.\n"
