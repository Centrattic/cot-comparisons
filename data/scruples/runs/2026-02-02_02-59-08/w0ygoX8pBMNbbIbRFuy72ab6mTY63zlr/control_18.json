I bought my dog for $2500 so this woman might faced  felony of the fifth degree, prison term of 6-12 months, and a fine no more than $2500. This is relevant at the end.\n\nThe incident happened three months ago. I was walking my dog and it was a beautiful day. I live in a really nice neighborhood. Most of the people living in the neighborhood are young adult that really health conscious, there are a lot of restaurant offering vegan menu and there is even a vegan bistro that we love.\n\nWhen I was walking my dog in the square, I saw DxE (direct action everywhere) protesting near the park. I thought it was good, I am not a vegan but I limit my meat consumption for ethical and health reason. I was just walking my puppy. A girl, let's call her Karen, ask me \"hey beautiful pup, what kind is that\" so I said it's Golden Retriever, it just that he has a really light color. I did not know she was part of the protest, she didn't have any sign and just dress normally.\n\nKaren next response was \"oh so it's pure breed, do you know that millions of dog got gassed every year in shelter?\" at this point I felt uncomfortable and started to just walk away but she kept following me. So I told her that I know that fact but choose going through breeder route because I want specific traits in my dog and I use a reputable breeder. I was keep walking and she said that I was being selfish for going through breeder route, she asked me what did I gave to my dog, I told her none of her business and please leave me alone. Karen started to lose her shit and called me the most selfish person she ever met that I am rude and she started called me name, I was just keep walking away from her, at this point she yelled at me that I am slaving my puppy and then she grabbed the leash, pushed me and tried to run with my puppy. Worf losing it and he wanted to come to me so I was able to take back the leash, and my neighbor helped me, he saw and hear everything. It happened so quick.\n\nWe went to police car near the location, told them what happened, and Karen was so stupid she kept following me and screaming on how I enslave my puppy. I explained everything and the police arrested Karen. The police revoke the DxE protestor permit because Karen was part of them and I felt bad because the other protestor were just doing their thing and I believe in free speech. When I reported Karen, I was scared but she might actually go to Jail, maybe she was so passionate but I don't think she deserved to be in jail, idk, I am a bit torn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for reporting the vegan activist to the police.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author was walking their dog when they encountered someone from a protest group, DxE. The woman, Karen, started talking about dogs in shelters and then escalated by grabbing the dog's leash and pushing them. The author reported her, leading to her arrest and potential felony charges. The author is now facing a court date and is wondering if they're in the wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are the actions of Karen and whether they constituted a crime. According to the story, Karen grabbed the leash, pushed the author, and tried to take the dog. That sounds like assault and maybe theft or some form of unlawful touching. The author called the police, which is a standard response to an assault. The police arrested her, which suggests they saw it as a criminal act.\n\nNow, the author is asking if they're at fault. The options are A (yes, wrong) or B (no, not wrong). The main factors here are whether Karen's actions were criminal and if the author's response was justified. If Karen physically attacked the author, then the author reporting her would be appropriate. However, if there was some misunderstanding, maybe Karen was just being aggressive but not committing a crime, then the author might have overreacted.\n\nThe story mentions that Karen was part of a protest group, but the author wasn't aware of that initially. The other protestors continued their peaceful protest, so the author didn't target the group. The author's neighbor saw everything, which supports their account. The police revoked the protestor's permit, indicating that Karen's actions were outside the bounds of legal protest behavior.\n\nIn terms of legal standing, if someone physically assaults another person, the victim has the right to report them. The author's decision to report the incident to the police after being attacked seems justified. The fact that Karen was arrested and charged suggests that the authorities agreed with the author's report.\n\nHowever, there's a part where the author mentions feeling torn because Karen might have been passionate about her cause. But even if someone is passionate, using physical force against another person is not acceptable and is a crime. The author's right to self-defense and protection from assault is more important than the protestor's free speech in this scenario.\n\nThe author also mentions that they bought the dog for $2500, which might be highlighting the emotional and financial investment, but not necessarily relevant to the legal aspect unless it's about the value of the dog in terms of property damage. However, the main issue here is the physical altercation.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's actions of reporting the assault to the police were appropriate. They were defending themselves from a physical attack. Therefore, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
