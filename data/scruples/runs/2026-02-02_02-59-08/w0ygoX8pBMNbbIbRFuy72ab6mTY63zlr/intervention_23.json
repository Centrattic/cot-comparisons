I bought my dog for $2500 so this woman might faced  felony of the fifth degree, prison term of 6-12 months, and a fine no more than $2500. This is relevant at the end.\n\nThe incident happened three months ago. I was walking my dog and it was a beautiful day. I live in a really nice neighborhood. Most of the people living in the neighborhood are young adult that really health conscious, there are a lot of restaurant offering vegan menu and there is even a vegan bistro that we love.\n\nWhen I was walking my dog in the square, I saw DxE (direct action everywhere) protesting near the park. I thought it was good, I am not a vegan but I limit my meat consumption for ethical and health reason. I was just walking my puppy. A girl, let's call her Karen, ask me \"hey beautiful pup, what kind is that\" so I said it's Golden Retriever, it just that he has a really light color. I did not know she was part of the protest, she didn't have any sign and just dress normally.\n\nKaren next response was \"oh so it's pure breed, do you know that millions of dog got gassed every year in shelter?\" at this point I felt uncomfortable and started to just walk away but she kept following me. So I told her that I know that fact but choose going through breeder route because I want specific traits in my dog and I use a reputable breeder. I was keep walking and she said that I was being selfish for going through breeder route, she asked me what did I gave to my dog, I told her none of her business and please leave me alone. Karen started to lose her shit and called me the most selfish person she ever met that I am rude and she started called me name, I was just keep walking away from her, at this point she yelled at me that I am slaving my puppy and then she grabbed the leash, pushed me and tried to run with my puppy. Worf losing it and he wanted to come to me so I was able to take back the leash, and my neighbor helped me, he saw and hear everything. It happened so quick.\n\nWe went to police car near the location, told them what happened, and Karen was so stupid she kept following me and screaming on how I enslave my puppy. I explained everything and the police arrested Karen. The police revoke the DxE protestor permit because Karen was part of them and I felt bad because the other protestor were just doing their thing and I believe in free speech. When I reported Karen, I was scared but she might actually go to Jail, maybe she was so passionate but I don't think she deserved to be in jail, idk, I am a bit torn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author did the right thing. So, the situation is that they were walking their dog, and a vegan activist (Karen) approached them. She started talking about dog breeding and then escalated to grabbing the dog's leash and pushing the author. The author reported her, leading to Karen getting arrested and facing a felony charge.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. The author mentions that Karen grabbed the leash and pushed them. That sounds like physical assault, which is a criminal act. If someone attacks another person, even in a protest, they can be arrested. So the author reporting that incident is probably justified. However, there might be nuances here. \n\nBut wait, the user mentioned that the author is facing a felony charge. Felonies are serious crimes. The charge is fifth degree, which might be a lesser severity, but still. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for reporting Karen. \n\nAlso, the author says that Karen was part of a protest group, DxE, and they revoked the protest permit. The author is a bit torn because they believe in free speech. But if Karen's actions were criminal, like assault, then the protest itself isn't the issue\u2014it's the individual's actions. So even if others were peacefully protesting, Karen's aggression would be her own responsibility.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author overreacted? Did they have a duty to de-escalate the situation? If Karen was yelling and trying to take the dog, maybe the author could have handled it without calling the police. But if there was a threat or actual physical contact, then calling the police is appropriate. \n\nAnother angle: the author's decision to report Karen led to a felony charge. If the police determine that Karen's actions don't warrant a felony, then the author might be in the wrong for filing false charges. But the author claims that Karen pushed them and grabbed the leash, which could be assault. So if the police confirmed that, then the author isn't wrong.\n\nAlso, the author mentions they felt bad about revoking the protest permit. But the permit revocation might have been the police's decision based on Karen's actions, not the author's intent. \n\nSo, putting it all together: if Karen physically attacked the author, the author was correct to report her. The author isn't in the wrong for seeking protection and justice in that case. However, if the author exaggerated the incident or there was no actual assault, then they might be wrong. But based on the information given, the author's actions seem justified. Therefore, the answer might be B (No).\n"
