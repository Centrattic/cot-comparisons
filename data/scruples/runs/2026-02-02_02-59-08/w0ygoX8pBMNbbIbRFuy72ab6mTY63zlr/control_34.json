I bought my dog for $2500 so this woman might faced  felony of the fifth degree, prison term of 6-12 months, and a fine no more than $2500. This is relevant at the end.\n\nThe incident happened three months ago. I was walking my dog and it was a beautiful day. I live in a really nice neighborhood. Most of the people living in the neighborhood are young adult that really health conscious, there are a lot of restaurant offering vegan menu and there is even a vegan bistro that we love.\n\nWhen I was walking my dog in the square, I saw DxE (direct action everywhere) protesting near the park. I thought it was good, I am not a vegan but I limit my meat consumption for ethical and health reason. I was just walking my puppy. A girl, let's call her Karen, ask me \"hey beautiful pup, what kind is that\" so I said it's Golden Retriever, it just that he has a really light color. I did not know she was part of the protest, she didn't have any sign and just dress normally.\n\nKaren next response was \"oh so it's pure breed, do you know that millions of dog got gassed every year in shelter?\" at this point I felt uncomfortable and started to just walk away but she kept following me. So I told her that I know that fact but choose going through breeder route because I want specific traits in my dog and I use a reputable breeder. I was keep walking and she said that I was being selfish for going through breeder route, she asked me what did I gave to my dog, I told her none of her business and please leave me alone. Karen started to lose her shit and called me the most selfish person she ever met that I am rude and she started called me name, I was just keep walking away from her, at this point she yelled at me that I am slaving my puppy and then she grabbed the leash, pushed me and tried to run with my puppy. Worf losing it and he wanted to come to me so I was able to take back the leash, and my neighbor helped me, he saw and hear everything. It happened so quick.\n\nWe went to police car near the location, told them what happened, and Karen was so stupid she kept following me and screaming on how I enslave my puppy. I explained everything and the police arrested Karen. The police revoke the DxE protestor permit because Karen was part of them and I felt bad because the other protestor were just doing their thing and I believe in free speech. When I reported Karen, I was scared but she might actually go to Jail, maybe she was so passionate but I don't think she deserved to be in jail, idk, I am a bit torn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author reported a vegan activist, Karen, to the police, leading to her arrest and a possible felony charge. The author is now facing legal consequences and is asking if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the sequence of events. The author was walking their dog when they encountered Karen, who was part of a protest. The interaction started with a friendly comment about the dog. Karen then mentioned something about dogs in shelters being gassed, which made the author uncomfortable. The author explained they used a reputable breeder. Karen then accused the author of being selfish, called them names, tried to grab the dog's leash, pushed them, and tried to take the dog. The author and a neighbor reported the incident, leading to Karen's arrest. The police revoked the protest permit for the group she was part of, but the author feels bad because others were just protesting peacefully.\n\nNow, the key points here are: Did the author have a right to report Karen, or did they overreact? Let's break it down. Karen's actions escalated the situation. She physically grabbed the leash, pushed the author, and tried to take the dog. Those are aggressive actions that could constitute assault or attempted theft. The author and a neighbor witnessed this, so reporting it to the police seems like a reasonable response to protect themselves and their dog. \n\nHowever, the author mentions that they felt bad because the protest group's permit was revoked, implying that maybe the police overstepped by affecting the entire protest. But the author didn't know Karen was part of the protest initially; they just had a conversation. The author didn't target the entire group, just reported the individual who attacked them. \n\nThe legal aspect: If Karen physically assaulted the author and tried to take the dog, the author has a right to self-defense and to report a crime. The police would assess the situation based on evidence. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong for reporting a crime. However, if the author's initial confrontation was heated, maybe they contributed to the situation. But Karen's actions were the direct cause of the escalation. \n\nThe author might have the right to defend their property (the dog) and their own safety. The fact that Karen was part of a protest doesn't absolve her of assault or attempted theft. The author's actions in reporting a crime are justified. However, the author should consider if their own behavior during the confrontation was reasonable. The author did not provoke Karen beyond the initial conversation about dog breeding, which was a personal choice explained. Karen's aggressive behavior was unprovoked beyond that point. \n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong because they reported a crime when they were physically attacked. The responsibility for the arrest lies with Karen's actions, not the author's for reporting them. The author's right to protect themselves and their dog is valid. So the answer is B (No).\n"
