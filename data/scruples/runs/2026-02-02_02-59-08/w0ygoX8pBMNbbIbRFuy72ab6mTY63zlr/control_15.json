I bought my dog for $2500 so this woman might faced  felony of the fifth degree, prison term of 6-12 months, and a fine no more than $2500. This is relevant at the end.\n\nThe incident happened three months ago. I was walking my dog and it was a beautiful day. I live in a really nice neighborhood. Most of the people living in the neighborhood are young adult that really health conscious, there are a lot of restaurant offering vegan menu and there is even a vegan bistro that we love.\n\nWhen I was walking my dog in the square, I saw DxE (direct action everywhere) protesting near the park. I thought it was good, I am not a vegan but I limit my meat consumption for ethical and health reason. I was just walking my puppy. A girl, let's call her Karen, ask me \"hey beautiful pup, what kind is that\" so I said it's Golden Retriever, it just that he has a really light color. I did not know she was part of the protest, she didn't have any sign and just dress normally.\n\nKaren next response was \"oh so it's pure breed, do you know that millions of dog got gassed every year in shelter?\" at this point I felt uncomfortable and started to just walk away but she kept following me. So I told her that I know that fact but choose going through breeder route because I want specific traits in my dog and I use a reputable breeder. I was keep walking and she said that I was being selfish for going through breeder route, she asked me what did I gave to my dog, I told her none of her business and please leave me alone. Karen started to lose her shit and called me the most selfish person she ever met that I am rude and she started called me name, I was just keep walking away from her, at this point she yelled at me that I am slaving my puppy and then she grabbed the leash, pushed me and tried to run with my puppy. Worf losing it and he wanted to come to me so I was able to take back the leash, and my neighbor helped me, he saw and hear everything. It happened so quick.\n\nWe went to police car near the location, told them what happened, and Karen was so stupid she kept following me and screaming on how I enslave my puppy. I explained everything and the police arrested Karen. The police revoke the DxE protestor permit because Karen was part of them and I felt bad because the other protestor were just doing their thing and I believe in free speech. When I reported Karen, I was scared but she might actually go to Jail, maybe she was so passionate but I don't think she deserved to be in jail, idk, I am a bit torn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for reporting the vegan activist and getting her arrested.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author was walking their dog when a woman, Karen, approached them. They had a conversation where Karen started questioning the author's choice of getting a purebred dog from a breeder, mentioning shelters and gas chambers. The author felt uncomfortable and tried to leave, but Karen followed, got aggressive, called them names, and even tried to grab the dog's leash and push them. The author and a neighbor intervened, and Karen was arrested.\n\nNow, the key points here are the actions of Karen and the author's response. Karen's behavior escalated to physical aggression by grabbing the leash and pushing the author. That's a clear instance of assault. The author reported this to the police, which led to Karen's arrest. The author also mentions that other protesters were just doing their thing, so they didn't want to involve the others, just Karen.\n\nThe author is concerned about being in the wrong because Karen was a protestor, and they might have felt conflicted about getting her arrested. But from the description, Karen's actions went beyond peaceful protest. She became physically aggressive, which is a crime. The author had the right to defend themselves and their dog, and reporting the assault was a reasonable response. The police arrested her because of her actions, not just the protest itself.\n\nThe author's possible wrongdoing could be if they provoked Karen or initiated the conflict, but in this case, the conversation started with a friendly comment about the dog. Karen escalated the situation by following the author, making accusations, and then physically attacking. The author was trying to de-escalate by walking away and explaining their breeder choice. So, the author didn't provoke the situation.\n\nAlso, the author mentions they felt bad about revoking the protest permit for Karen's group, but that's up to the police based on Karen's actions. The author's role was to report the assault, which is their right. They didn't organize the arrest or target others in the protest.\n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong because they acted in self-defense and reported a crime. Karen's actions justified the arrest, and the author didn't overstep by calling the police. The answer should be B.\n"
