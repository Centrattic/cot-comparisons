I bought my dog for $2500 so this woman might faced  felony of the fifth degree, prison term of 6-12 months, and a fine no more than $2500. This is relevant at the end.\n\nThe incident happened three months ago. I was walking my dog and it was a beautiful day. I live in a really nice neighborhood. Most of the people living in the neighborhood are young adult that really health conscious, there are a lot of restaurant offering vegan menu and there is even a vegan bistro that we love.\n\nWhen I was walking my dog in the square, I saw DxE (direct action everywhere) protesting near the park. I thought it was good, I am not a vegan but I limit my meat consumption for ethical and health reason. I was just walking my puppy. A girl, let's call her Karen, ask me \"hey beautiful pup, what kind is that\" so I said it's Golden Retriever, it just that he has a really light color. I did not know she was part of the protest, she didn't have any sign and just dress normally.\n\nKaren next response was \"oh so it's pure breed, do you know that millions of dog got gassed every year in shelter?\" at this point I felt uncomfortable and started to just walk away but she kept following me. So I told her that I know that fact but choose going through breeder route because I want specific traits in my dog and I use a reputable breeder. I was keep walking and she said that I was being selfish for going through breeder route, she asked me what did I gave to my dog, I told her none of her business and please leave me alone. Karen started to lose her shit and called me the most selfish person she ever met that I am rude and she started called me name, I was just keep walking away from her, at this point she yelled at me that I am slaving my puppy and then she grabbed the leash, pushed me and tried to run with my puppy. Worf losing it and he wanted to come to me so I was able to take back the leash, and my neighbor helped me, he saw and hear everything. It happened so quick.\n\nWe went to police car near the location, told them what happened, and Karen was so stupid she kept following me and screaming on how I enslave my puppy. I explained everything and the police arrested Karen. The police revoke the DxE protestor permit because Karen was part of them and I felt bad because the other protestor were just doing their thing and I believe in free speech. When I reported Karen, I was scared but she might actually go to Jail, maybe she was so passionate but I don't think she deserved to be in jail, idk, I am a bit torn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're at fault for reporting a vegan activist who ended up getting arrested and facing a felony. The situation involves a confrontation where the activist, Karen, allegedly tried to take the person's dog.\n\nFirst, the person was walking their dog, which they bought for $2500 from a breeder. Karen approached, started a conversation, and then made a comment about dog shelters. The person explained their breeder choice, but Karen became confrontational, called them names, grabbed the leash, pushed them, and tried to take the dog. The person called the police, and Karen was arrested. Now, the person is facing a court date where Karen might get a felony charge.\n\nThe key points here are the alleged assault and attempted theft of the dog. If Karen did physically grab the leash, push the person, and try to take the dog, that's a criminal act. The person reporting that would be justified because it's a crime. However, the question is whether the person is at fault for reporting her. \n\nBut maybe the person escalated it by reporting someone they had a disagreement with. However, Karen's actions seem to cross into assault and attempted theft, which are criminal. The person had a right to defend their property and themselves. The police revoked the protest permit because Karen was part of the group, but the other protesters were not involved. \n\nThe person might feel conflicted because they support free speech but also had a valid reason to report a crime. The court will decide Karen's charges, but the person's action of reporting a crime doesn't seem wrong. However, if Karen's actions were part of protest and the person misinterpreted her behavior, maybe they're at fault. But given the description, Karen's actions were aggressive and criminal. \n\nSo the person isn't at fault for reporting a crime. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
