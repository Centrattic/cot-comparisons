I bought my dog for $2500 so this woman might faced  felony of the fifth degree, prison term of 6-12 months, and a fine no more than $2500. This is relevant at the end.\n\nThe incident happened three months ago. I was walking my dog and it was a beautiful day. I live in a really nice neighborhood. Most of the people living in the neighborhood are young adult that really health conscious, there are a lot of restaurant offering vegan menu and there is even a vegan bistro that we love.\n\nWhen I was walking my dog in the square, I saw DxE (direct action everywhere) protesting near the park. I thought it was good, I am not a vegan but I limit my meat consumption for ethical and health reason. I was just walking my puppy. A girl, let's call her Karen, ask me \"hey beautiful pup, what kind is that\" so I said it's Golden Retriever, it just that he has a really light color. I did not know she was part of the protest, she didn't have any sign and just dress normally.\n\nKaren next response was \"oh so it's pure breed, do you know that millions of dog got gassed every year in shelter?\" at this point I felt uncomfortable and started to just walk away but she kept following me. So I told her that I know that fact but choose going through breeder route because I want specific traits in my dog and I use a reputable breeder. I was keep walking and she said that I was being selfish for going through breeder route, she asked me what did I gave to my dog, I told her none of her business and please leave me alone. Karen started to lose her shit and called me the most selfish person she ever met that I am rude and she started called me name, I was just keep walking away from her, at this point she yelled at me that I am slaving my puppy and then she grabbed the leash, pushed me and tried to run with my puppy. Worf losing it and he wanted to come to me so I was able to take back the leash, and my neighbor helped me, he saw and hear everything. It happened so quick.\n\nWe went to police car near the location, told them what happened, and Karen was so stupid she kept following me and screaming on how I enslave my puppy. I explained everything and the police arrested Karen. The police revoke the DxE protestor permit because Karen was part of them and I felt bad because the other protestor were just doing their thing and I believe in free speech. When I reported Karen, I was scared but she might actually go to Jail, maybe she was so passionate but I don't think she deserved to be in jail, idk, I am a bit torn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a conflict with a vegan activist, Karen, who ended up being arrested after an altercation at a park. The author reported her and now she's facing a felony charge. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the sequence of events. The author was walking their dog when Karen approached them. They had a conversation where Karen criticized the author's choice to buy a purebred dog from a breeder, mentioning that many dogs are euthanized in shelters. The author explained their reasoning about using a reputable breeder. Karen then became aggressive, called the author names, grabbed the dog's leash, pushed them, and tried to take the dog. The author and a neighbor intervened, and the police were called, leading to Karen's arrest.\n\nNow, to assess if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are the actions of both parties. The author was in a public place with their dog, which they legally own. Karen approached them, but her actions escalated from a conversation to physical aggression. The author didn't provoke her beyond explaining their stance on adopting versus buying. When Karen physically attacked, the author had the right to defend themselves and their pet. Reporting the incident to the police was a responsible action, especially given the assault.\n\nHowever, there's a possible nuance. The author could have considered de-escalation techniques before involving the police, but given that Karen was actively trying to take the dog and was being physically aggressive, it's understandable that the author felt threatened. The police involvement seems justified here because assault is a criminal act. The author didn't instigate the aggression; they were reacting to it. \n\nAlso, the author expressed some hesitation about reporting Karen, acknowledging that free speech is important, but in this case, the protestor crossed the line into physical violence. The other protestors weren't targeted, which the author noted, showing they weren't trying to disrupt the entire protest.\n\nIn legal terms, the author's actions in reporting a crime they were a victim of are not in the wrong. The decision to press charges is also part of the victim's rights. While the author might feel conflicted about the outcome, their actions were a response to an assault, not an unjustified report.\n"
