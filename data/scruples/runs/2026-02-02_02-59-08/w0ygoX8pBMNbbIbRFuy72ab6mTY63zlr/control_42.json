I bought my dog for $2500 so this woman might faced  felony of the fifth degree, prison term of 6-12 months, and a fine no more than $2500. This is relevant at the end.\n\nThe incident happened three months ago. I was walking my dog and it was a beautiful day. I live in a really nice neighborhood. Most of the people living in the neighborhood are young adult that really health conscious, there are a lot of restaurant offering vegan menu and there is even a vegan bistro that we love.\n\nWhen I was walking my dog in the square, I saw DxE (direct action everywhere) protesting near the park. I thought it was good, I am not a vegan but I limit my meat consumption for ethical and health reason. I was just walking my puppy. A girl, let's call her Karen, ask me \"hey beautiful pup, what kind is that\" so I said it's Golden Retriever, it just that he has a really light color. I did not know she was part of the protest, she didn't have any sign and just dress normally.\n\nKaren next response was \"oh so it's pure breed, do you know that millions of dog got gassed every year in shelter?\" at this point I felt uncomfortable and started to just walk away but she kept following me. So I told her that I know that fact but choose going through breeder route because I want specific traits in my dog and I use a reputable breeder. I was keep walking and she said that I was being selfish for going through breeder route, she asked me what did I gave to my dog, I told her none of her business and please leave me alone. Karen started to lose her shit and called me the most selfish person she ever met that I am rude and she started called me name, I was just keep walking away from her, at this point she yelled at me that I am slaving my puppy and then she grabbed the leash, pushed me and tried to run with my puppy. Worf losing it and he wanted to come to me so I was able to take back the leash, and my neighbor helped me, he saw and hear everything. It happened so quick.\n\nWe went to police car near the location, told them what happened, and Karen was so stupid she kept following me and screaming on how I enslave my puppy. I explained everything and the police arrested Karen. The police revoke the DxE protestor permit because Karen was part of them and I felt bad because the other protestor were just doing their thing and I believe in free speech. When I reported Karen, I was scared but she might actually go to Jail, maybe she was so passionate but I don't think she deserved to be in jail, idk, I am a bit torn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who reported the vegan activist is in the wrong. The scenario is that the person was walking their dog, got into a confrontation with a protester from DxE, who tried to grab the dog's leash and push them. The person reported the incident, leading to the activist's arrest and a felony charge. The question is whether the author is at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. The activist approached the person, had a conversation, then escalated the situation by grabbing the leash and pushing them. The person then called the police, which led to the arrest. The key points here are whether the activist's actions were criminal and if the person was justified in reporting them.\n\nIn terms of legal aspects, assault and battery could be involved if there was physical contact without consent. If the activist pushed the person and tried to take the dog, that could be considered assault. The police arrested her, which suggests they saw some wrongdoing. However, the outcome is a felony charge, which is a serious matter. The person might be questioned about whether they provoked the situation or exaggerated the incident.\n\nThe user mentions that they felt uncomfortable but tried to walk away. The activist followed, called them names, and physically tried to take the dog. The person's reaction was to get the police involved. Their neighbor witnessed the incident, which adds credibility. But was the person in the wrong for not letting the activist speak out? Did they have the right to escalate to police?\n\nAnother angle: the person might have a duty to de-escalate. However, when someone physically attacks or tries to take your pet, calling the police is a natural response. The activist's actions might have crossed the line from protest to assault, making the report justified.\n\nBut there's also the context of the protest. If the activist was part of a protest group, maybe she was acting in a way that's part of their tactics, even if it's not legal. The person might have overreacted, leading to a felony charge for the activist. However, since the police were involved and made an arrest, it's possible that the actions were indeed criminal.\n\nAlso, considering the user's own statement that they felt bad about revoking the protest permit, they might be conflicted. But the individual activist's actions don't necessarily reflect on the entire group. If the activist broke the law, the report is justified regardless of the group's usual activities.\n\nIn conclusion, the person might not be in the wrong because the activist's actions could constitute assault, and reporting a crime is the right thing to do. However, if the initial confrontation was minor and the person overreacted, they could be partially at fault. But given the physical contact and attempted abduction of the dog, the report seems justified. So the answer is B (No).\n"
