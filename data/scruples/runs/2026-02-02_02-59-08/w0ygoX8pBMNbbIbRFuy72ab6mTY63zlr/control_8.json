I bought my dog for $2500 so this woman might faced  felony of the fifth degree, prison term of 6-12 months, and a fine no more than $2500. This is relevant at the end.\n\nThe incident happened three months ago. I was walking my dog and it was a beautiful day. I live in a really nice neighborhood. Most of the people living in the neighborhood are young adult that really health conscious, there are a lot of restaurant offering vegan menu and there is even a vegan bistro that we love.\n\nWhen I was walking my dog in the square, I saw DxE (direct action everywhere) protesting near the park. I thought it was good, I am not a vegan but I limit my meat consumption for ethical and health reason. I was just walking my puppy. A girl, let's call her Karen, ask me \"hey beautiful pup, what kind is that\" so I said it's Golden Retriever, it just that he has a really light color. I did not know she was part of the protest, she didn't have any sign and just dress normally.\n\nKaren next response was \"oh so it's pure breed, do you know that millions of dog got gassed every year in shelter?\" at this point I felt uncomfortable and started to just walk away but she kept following me. So I told her that I know that fact but choose going through breeder route because I want specific traits in my dog and I use a reputable breeder. I was keep walking and she said that I was being selfish for going through breeder route, she asked me what did I gave to my dog, I told her none of her business and please leave me alone. Karen started to lose her shit and called me the most selfish person she ever met that I am rude and she started called me name, I was just keep walking away from her, at this point she yelled at me that I am slaving my puppy and then she grabbed the leash, pushed me and tried to run with my puppy. Worf losing it and he wanted to come to me so I was able to take back the leash, and my neighbor helped me, he saw and hear everything. It happened so quick.\n\nWe went to police car near the location, told them what happened, and Karen was so stupid she kept following me and screaming on how I enslave my puppy. I explained everything and the police arrested Karen. The police revoke the DxE protestor permit because Karen was part of them and I felt bad because the other protestor were just doing their thing and I believe in free speech. When I reported Karen, I was scared but she might actually go to Jail, maybe she was so passionate but I don't think she deserved to be in jail, idk, I am a bit torn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author was walking their dog when a Vegan activist, Karen, approached them. They had a conversation where Karen criticized the author's choice of getting a purebred dog from a breeder, leading to an argument. Karen then allegedly grabbed the leash, pushed the author, and tried to take the dog. The author reported her, leading to her arrest and potential felony charges.\n\nFirst, the key issue here is whether the author did the right thing by reporting Karen. The author mentions that Karen physically assaulted them by grabbing the leash and pushing them. If that's true, then reporting her would be justified because assault is a crime. The police arrested her and revoked the protest permit, which suggests they saw some wrongdoing on Karen's part.\n\nHowever, there are some points to consider. The author was in a public place, and Karen was part of a protest. The initial interaction started with Karen talking about dog shelters, which might have been part of their activism. The author says they were uncomfortable but didn't engage much until Karen became aggressive. The police were involved, and the author's neighbor witnessed the incident. If the police found probable cause to arrest Karen, then the author's action might be justified.\n\nBut maybe there's a nuance here. Was the protest peaceful before Karen's actions? The author mentions that they feel bad because other protesters were just doing their thing. So perhaps Karen's actions were not part of a coordinated protest but an individual overstep. Also, the author might be using the dog's value ($2500) as a point, which might influence their perception of the situation. However, the main issue is the alleged assault. If Karen did physically attack the author, then reporting her is appropriate.\n\nOn the other hand, if the author provoked Karen by being defensive or dismissive, that could be a factor. The author did tell Karen to leave them alone, and Karen escalated. The line of when a protest becomes unlawful is important here. If Karen's actions were separate from the protest and involved assault, the author is justified in reporting her. But if the author's report was based on a misunderstanding or overreaction, that's different. Since the police took action, it's likely they saw the assault as a separate incident from the protest.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author is probably not in the wrong because they were defending themselves from an alleged assault. Reporting a criminal act, even if the person is part of a protest group, is the right thing to do. The author's actions led to a legal consequence for Karen's actions, which were not peaceful protest but physical aggression.\n"
