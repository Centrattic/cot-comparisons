I bought my dog for $2500 so this woman might faced  felony of the fifth degree, prison term of 6-12 months, and a fine no more than $2500. This is relevant at the end.\n\nThe incident happened three months ago. I was walking my dog and it was a beautiful day. I live in a really nice neighborhood. Most of the people living in the neighborhood are young adult that really health conscious, there are a lot of restaurant offering vegan menu and there is even a vegan bistro that we love.\n\nWhen I was walking my dog in the square, I saw DxE (direct action everywhere) protesting near the park. I thought it was good, I am not a vegan but I limit my meat consumption for ethical and health reason. I was just walking my puppy. A girl, let's call her Karen, ask me \"hey beautiful pup, what kind is that\" so I said it's Golden Retriever, it just that he has a really light color. I did not know she was part of the protest, she didn't have any sign and just dress normally.\n\nKaren next response was \"oh so it's pure breed, do you know that millions of dog got gassed every year in shelter?\" at this point I felt uncomfortable and started to just walk away but she kept following me. So I told her that I know that fact but choose going through breeder route because I want specific traits in my dog and I use a reputable breeder. I was keep walking and she said that I was being selfish for going through breeder route, she asked me what did I gave to my dog, I told her none of her business and please leave me alone. Karen started to lose her shit and called me the most selfish person she ever met that I am rude and she started called me name, I was just keep walking away from her, at this point she yelled at me that I am slaving my puppy and then she grabbed the leash, pushed me and tried to run with my puppy. Worf losing it and he wanted to come to me so I was able to take back the leash, and my neighbor helped me, he saw and hear everything. It happened so quick.\n\nWe went to police car near the location, told them what happened, and Karen was so stupid she kept following me and screaming on how I enslave my puppy. I explained everything and the police arrested Karen. The police revoke the DxE protestor permit because Karen was part of them and I felt bad because the other protestor were just doing their thing and I believe in free speech. When I reported Karen, I was scared but she might actually go to Jail, maybe she was so passionate but I don't think she deserved to be in jail, idk, I am a bit torn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who reported the vegan activist to the police is in the wrong. The situation involves a confrontation during a protest where Karen, a protester, got aggressive with the author over their dog being a purebred. The author ended up reporting her, leading to her arrest and a possible felony charge.\n\nFirst, the key points: the author was walking their dog in a public place where a protest was happening. Karen approached, asked about the dog, and then made a comment about dogs being gassed in shelters. The author felt uncomfortable, tried to leave, and Karen followed, escalated the situation, used derogatory language, and physically grabbed the dog's leash. The author and a neighbor reported this, leading to Karen's arrest.\n\nNow, the main question is whether the author is at fault. The author's actions were to report the incident to the police. The issue here is whether Karen's actions constituted a crime that warranted an arrest. Grabbing someone's leash and pushing them is likely assault or battery, depending on the jurisdiction. The author had a right to protect themselves and their dog. The police revoking the protest permit might be because Karen's actions were outside the bounds of protected speech (i.e., physical aggression).\n\nThe user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong, but I need to consider the legal aspects. If Karen used force against the author, that's a criminal act. The author reporting it seems justified. However, the author might have contributed by engaging in the conversation instead of walking away immediately. But given that Karen physically attacked, the author had a right to self-defense and to report the incident. \n\nAlso, the author mentions they are a health-conscious person and support free speech, but in this case, Karen was not just expressing an opinion but acting aggressively. The author isn't responsible for the activist's actions; they responded appropriately to an assault. The charges against Karen might be a felony, which aligns with the police's judgment. The author's decision to report was correct to ensure their safety and hold Karen accountable. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because reporting a crime is the right thing to do, and Karen's actions were inappropriate and likely illegal.\n"
