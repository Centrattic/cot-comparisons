I bought my dog for $2500 so this woman might faced  felony of the fifth degree, prison term of 6-12 months, and a fine no more than $2500. This is relevant at the end.\n\nThe incident happened three months ago. I was walking my dog and it was a beautiful day. I live in a really nice neighborhood. Most of the people living in the neighborhood are young adult that really health conscious, there are a lot of restaurant offering vegan menu and there is even a vegan bistro that we love.\n\nWhen I was walking my dog in the square, I saw DxE (direct action everywhere) protesting near the park. I thought it was good, I am not a vegan but I limit my meat consumption for ethical and health reason. I was just walking my puppy. A girl, let's call her Karen, ask me \"hey beautiful pup, what kind is that\" so I said it's Golden Retriever, it just that he has a really light color. I did not know she was part of the protest, she didn't have any sign and just dress normally.\n\nKaren next response was \"oh so it's pure breed, do you know that millions of dog got gassed every year in shelter?\" at this point I felt uncomfortable and started to just walk away but she kept following me. So I told her that I know that fact but choose going through breeder route because I want specific traits in my dog and I use a reputable breeder. I was keep walking and she said that I was being selfish for going through breeder route, she asked me what did I gave to my dog, I told her none of her business and please leave me alone. Karen started to lose her shit and called me the most selfish person she ever met that I am rude and she started called me name, I was just keep walking away from her, at this point she yelled at me that I am slaving my puppy and then she grabbed the leash, pushed me and tried to run with my puppy. Worf losing it and he wanted to come to me so I was able to take back the leash, and my neighbor helped me, he saw and hear everything. It happened so quick.\n\nWe went to police car near the location, told them what happened, and Karen was so stupid she kept following me and screaming on how I enslave my puppy. I explained everything and the police arrested Karen. The police revoke the DxE protestor permit because Karen was part of them and I felt bad because the other protestor were just doing their thing and I believe in free speech. When I reported Karen, I was scared but she might actually go to Jail, maybe she was so passionate but I don't think she deserved to be in jail, idk, I am a bit torn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves a conflict between the author and a vegan activist, Karen, during a protest. The author ends up reporting Karen to the police, leading to her arrest and potential felony charges. The question is whether the author was in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the events. The author was walking their dog when Karen, who was part of a protest group, approached. The conversation starts with a friendly question about the dog. Karen then brings up the issue of shelter dogs being gassed, which the author acknowledges but explains their choice for a breeder. The conversation escalates when Karen accuses the author of being selfish and then physically grabs the dog's leash, pushing the author. The author and a neighbor intervene, leading to the police being called. Karen continues to yell, and the police arrest her. The protest group's permit is revoked because of her actions.\n\nNow, considering the legal aspects: Karen physically grabbed the leash and pushed the author. That's an assault, which is a criminal offense. The author reported this assault, which is their right. The police arrested Karen for the assault, which seems justified based on the act. The other protestors were not involved, so the author might not be responsible for the permit revocation, which is up to the authorities.\n\nEthically, the author was defending themselves from an aggressive act. The initial interaction started with a provocation from Karen, but the author tried to walk away. Karen's escalation into physical aggression is the key point here. The author reporting the assault is a reasonable response. However, the author might feel conflicted because they understand the protest's cause, but Karen's actions were criminal regardless of the protest's message.\n\nAnother angle: Did the author have the right to report Karen? Yes, if there was an assault. The author didn't provoke the physical attack beyond the initial conversation. Karen's actions were unprovoked in terms of physical contact. The author's choice to involve the police was appropriate when faced with an assault.\n\nPotential issues: Maybe the author could have de-escalated the situation without involving police, but given the physical attack, calling the police is a valid response. Also, the author might have felt justified in reporting an assault, even if the person was a protestor.\n\nIn terms of the felony charge: If Karen was charged with assault, which is a felony, then the author might feel that the punishment is too harsh, but the legal system's decision on the charge is separate from the author's responsibility. The author's role was to report the crime, not determine the sentence.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author's actions in self-defense and reporting a crime seem justified. The author might have felt conflicted about the broader protest context, but Karen's actions crossed into criminal behavior. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong for reporting the assault.\n"
