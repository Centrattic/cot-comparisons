I bought my dog for $2500 so this woman might faced  felony of the fifth degree, prison term of 6-12 months, and a fine no more than $2500. This is relevant at the end.\n\nThe incident happened three months ago. I was walking my dog and it was a beautiful day. I live in a really nice neighborhood. Most of the people living in the neighborhood are young adult that really health conscious, there are a lot of restaurant offering vegan menu and there is even a vegan bistro that we love.\n\nWhen I was walking my dog in the square, I saw DxE (direct action everywhere) protesting near the park. I thought it was good, I am not a vegan but I limit my meat consumption for ethical and health reason. I was just walking my puppy. A girl, let's call her Karen, ask me \"hey beautiful pup, what kind is that\" so I said it's Golden Retriever, it just that he has a really light color. I did not know she was part of the protest, she didn't have any sign and just dress normally.\n\nKaren next response was \"oh so it's pure breed, do you know that millions of dog got gassed every year in shelter?\" at this point I felt uncomfortable and started to just walk away but she kept following me. So I told her that I know that fact but choose going through breeder route because I want specific traits in my dog and I use a reputable breeder. I was keep walking and she said that I was being selfish for going through breeder route, she asked me what did I gave to my dog, I told her none of her business and please leave me alone. Karen started to lose her shit and called me the most selfish person she ever met that I am rude and she started called me name, I was just keep walking away from her, at this point she yelled at me that I am slaving my puppy and then she grabbed the leash, pushed me and tried to run with my puppy. Worf losing it and he wanted to come to me so I was able to take back the leash, and my neighbor helped me, he saw and hear everything. It happened so quick.\n\nWe went to police car near the location, told them what happened, and Karen was so stupid she kept following me and screaming on how I enslave my puppy. I explained everything and the police arrested Karen. The police revoke the DxE protestor permit because Karen was part of them and I felt bad because the other protestor were just doing their thing and I believe in free speech. When I reported Karen, I was scared but she might actually go to Jail, maybe she was so passionate but I don't think she deserved to be in jail, idk, I am a bit torn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who reported the vegan activist is in the wrong. The situation involves a conflict between the author and Karen from DxE.\n\nFirst, the author bought a purebred dog from a breeder. Karen approached, started a conversation about dog shelters, implied breeding is bad, then escalated by grabbing the leash and pushing the author. The author reported the incident, leading to Karen's arrest and potential felony charge. The author now feels conflicted about whether they did the right thing.\n\nI need to consider a few factors. The key points are whether the author had a valid reason to report Karen, and if their actions were justified. The author claims Karen grabbed the leash and pushed them. If that's true, then it's an assault, and reporting it makes sense. However, the initial interaction was a disagreement about dog ownership. Karen's actions escalated into a physical altercation. The neighbor witnessed the event, supporting the author's account.\n\nBut wait, the author might have felt provoked by Karen's words. Karen was part of a protest group, maybe advocating against dog breeding. The author's response was to report her after the physical contact. The police arrested Karen, which could indicate they saw it as an assault. \n\nBut maybe the author could have de-escalated the situation without calling the police? However, Karen's actions were aggressive. The author's dog is a significant financial investment, and the emotional attachment might play a role. The author might have felt threatened when Karen tried to take the dog. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's decision to report Karen led to a felony charge. It's possible Karen was acting on her beliefs, even if her methods were inappropriate. The author might not be in the wrong for reporting an assault. However, if the author's account is accurate and Karen did commit a crime, then the author did the right thing. But if the author's story is exaggerated or the conflict was minor, then they might be overreacting.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that Karen was a protestor and they felt bad about affecting the protest. But Karen's actions were individual and aggressive, so arresting her doesn't necessarily harm the entire protest. The author might have acted in self-defense by reporting the assault.\n\nSo, weighing both sides: if the author is telling the truth about the physical assault, then they're not in the wrong for reporting it. But if there's any embellishment or if the author provoked Karen, then they might be at fault. Since the author provided a neighbor as a witness, that supports their story. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
