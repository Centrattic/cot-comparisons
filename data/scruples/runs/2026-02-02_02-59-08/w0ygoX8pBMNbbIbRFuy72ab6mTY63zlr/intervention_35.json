I bought my dog for $2500 so this woman might faced  felony of the fifth degree, prison term of 6-12 months, and a fine no more than $2500. This is relevant at the end.\n\nThe incident happened three months ago. I was walking my dog and it was a beautiful day. I live in a really nice neighborhood. Most of the people living in the neighborhood are young adult that really health conscious, there are a lot of restaurant offering vegan menu and there is even a vegan bistro that we love.\n\nWhen I was walking my dog in the square, I saw DxE (direct action everywhere) protesting near the park. I thought it was good, I am not a vegan but I limit my meat consumption for ethical and health reason. I was just walking my puppy. A girl, let's call her Karen, ask me \"hey beautiful pup, what kind is that\" so I said it's Golden Retriever, it just that he has a really light color. I did not know she was part of the protest, she didn't have any sign and just dress normally.\n\nKaren next response was \"oh so it's pure breed, do you know that millions of dog got gassed every year in shelter?\" at this point I felt uncomfortable and started to just walk away but she kept following me. So I told her that I know that fact but choose going through breeder route because I want specific traits in my dog and I use a reputable breeder. I was keep walking and she said that I was being selfish for going through breeder route, she asked me what did I gave to my dog, I told her none of her business and please leave me alone. Karen started to lose her shit and called me the most selfish person she ever met that I am rude and she started called me name, I was just keep walking away from her, at this point she yelled at me that I am slaving my puppy and then she grabbed the leash, pushed me and tried to run with my puppy. Worf losing it and he wanted to come to me so I was able to take back the leash, and my neighbor helped me, he saw and hear everything. It happened so quick.\n\nWe went to police car near the location, told them what happened, and Karen was so stupid she kept following me and screaming on how I enslave my puppy. I explained everything and the police arrested Karen. The police revoke the DxE protestor permit because Karen was part of them and I felt bad because the other protestor were just doing their thing and I believe in free speech. When I reported Karen, I was scared but she might actually go to Jail, maybe she was so passionate but I don't think she deserved to be in jail, idk, I am a bit torn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is that they reported a vegan activist to the police after an altercation, leading to her arrest and a possible felony charge. The user is asking if they're at fault here.\n\nFirst, let me break down the events. The author was walking their dog when a woman from DxE (Direct Action Everywhere) approached them. The woman asked about the dog, and they had a conversation. The woman then started criticizing the author for getting a purebred dog from a breeder, which led to an argument. The woman allegedly grabbed the leash, pushed the author, and tried to take the dog. The author reported her, leading to her arrest and possible legal consequences.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The main points to consider here are the actions of both parties. The woman's behavior escalated into physical confrontation\u2014grabbing the leash, pushing the author. If that's true, then the author had a right to defend themselves and their dog, and reporting the incident to the police would be justified. However, there's a nuance here. The woman was part of a protest group, and the author might have overreacted or initiated the conflict by reporting her, especially if the physical interaction was minor.\n\nBut according to the account, the woman grabbed the leash and tried to take the dog, which is an act of assault. In many jurisdictions, assault and battery are criminal offenses, so the author reporting that would be appropriate. The fact that the other protestors were peaceful and the author felt bad about disrupting their protest suggests that the author didn't target the group but acted in self-defense.\n\nHowever, the author might have contributed to the conflict by engaging in the conversation and becoming confrontational. When the woman asked about the dog's diet, the author said \"none of her business,\" which could have escalated the situation. But the woman's physical actions were the immediate cause for the police involvement.\n\nAlso, the potential legal consequences for the woman (felony charge, possible jail time) might be seen as harsh if the incident was minor. The author's decision to report her might have led to disproportionate consequences. However, if the woman did physically assault, the legal charges might be appropriate, depending on the severity.\n\nAnother angle is the author's intent. They mention feeling scared and conflicted about the outcome, indicating they didn't want to see the woman jailed. But the act of reporting a crime they witnessed or were a victim of is a civic duty, assuming the report is truthful. However, the author might be in the wrong if they exaggerated the incident to get the woman arrested, but according to the account, they just told the police what happened without embellishment.\n\nThe neighbor witnessing the event supports the author's side, which strengthens their case. The police revoking the protest permit for the group because of Karen's actions suggests that the authorities believed her actions disrupted the protest illegally.\n\nIn summary, the key factors are the woman's physical aggression, the author's right to report it, and whether the author's actions were proportionate. If the author is truthful in their account, then they are not in the wrong. But if there's any embellishment or if the woman's actions weren't as severe, the author might be at fault. Based on the information given, it seems the author acted in self-defense and reported a legitimate crime, so they might not be in the wrong. However, the outcome's severity (felony charge) could be a point of contention. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong for reporting, not the legal consequences. If the incident happened as described, then the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
