I bought my dog for $2500 so this woman might faced  felony of the fifth degree, prison term of 6-12 months, and a fine no more than $2500. This is relevant at the end.\n\nThe incident happened three months ago. I was walking my dog and it was a beautiful day. I live in a really nice neighborhood. Most of the people living in the neighborhood are young adult that really health conscious, there are a lot of restaurant offering vegan menu and there is even a vegan bistro that we love.\n\nWhen I was walking my dog in the square, I saw DxE (direct action everywhere) protesting near the park. I thought it was good, I am not a vegan but I limit my meat consumption for ethical and health reason. I was just walking my puppy. A girl, let's call her Karen, ask me \"hey beautiful pup, what kind is that\" so I said it's Golden Retriever, it just that he has a really light color. I did not know she was part of the protest, she didn't have any sign and just dress normally.\n\nKaren next response was \"oh so it's pure breed, do you know that millions of dog got gassed every year in shelter?\" at this point I felt uncomfortable and started to just walk away but she kept following me. So I told her that I know that fact but choose going through breeder route because I want specific traits in my dog and I use a reputable breeder. I was keep walking and she said that I was being selfish for going through breeder route, she asked me what did I gave to my dog, I told her none of her business and please leave me alone. Karen started to lose her shit and called me the most selfish person she ever met that I am rude and she started called me name, I was just keep walking away from her, at this point she yelled at me that I am slaving my puppy and then she grabbed the leash, pushed me and tried to run with my puppy. Worf losing it and he wanted to come to me so I was able to take back the leash, and my neighbor helped me, he saw and hear everything. It happened so quick.\n\nWe went to police car near the location, told them what happened, and Karen was so stupid she kept following me and screaming on how I enslave my puppy. I explained everything and the police arrested Karen. The police revoke the DxE protestor permit because Karen was part of them and I felt bad because the other protestor were just doing their thing and I believe in free speech. When I reported Karen, I was scared but she might actually go to Jail, maybe she was so passionate but I don't think she deserved to be in jail, idk, I am a bit torn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the person who reported Karen is in the wrong here. First, I need to understand the situation. The user was walking their dog when a Karen from a vegan activist group approached. There was a conversation about purebred dogs and shelters. Then Karen got aggressive, grabbed the leash, pushed the user, and tried to take the dog. The user reported her, leading to her arrest and possible felony charges.\n\nSo the main question is whether the user did the right thing by reporting her. Let's break it down. The user was in a public place, had a conversation, and then Karen physically attacked them. The user then reported the incident to the police. From a legal standpoint, if someone physically assaults you, reporting them is usually the correct action. The user mentioned that a neighbor witnessed the event, which supports their account.\n\nBut wait, there's a possible issue here. Karen was part of a protest group, DxE. The user mentioned that other protesters were just doing their thing, so maybe the user is concerned about targeting one person from a group. However, Karen's actions were not part of a peaceful protest\u2014she was physically aggressive. The user didn't target the entire group, just the individual who committed the assault.\n\nAnother angle is the user's initial interaction. Karen started by complimenting the dog, which seems innocent. But then the conversation turned confrontational about breeding practices. The user tried to walk away but Karen followed, leading to the conflict. The user's response to \"none of her business\" might have escalated things, but Karen's reaction was physical aggression.\n\nThe user also bought the dog from a breeder, which might be a point of contention in a vegan community that supports shelter adoption. However, the user mentioned using a reputable breeder, which is a valid choice. The problem here is Karen's actions, not the user's decision to get a purebred.\n\nIn terms of the legal consequences: assault charges can be appropriate if there was physical contact and intent to harm. The user's account suggests that Karen grabbed the leash and pushed them. If the police agreed and issued a permit revocation, that supports the user's side. The user might feel conflicted because they didn't want to involve the police but had no choice when faced with physical violence.\n\nPossible counterarguments: Did the user provoke Karen by engaging in the conversation? Maybe, but Karen initiated the conversation. Also, the user's mention of the dog's color and the breeder choice might have led Karen to push her agenda, but that doesn't justify assault.\n\nIn conclusion, the user acted within their rights to report a physical assault. The key here is that Karen's actions went beyond verbal protest to physical violence. The user isn't in the wrong for protecting themselves and their dog and reporting the incident.\n"
