Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves a boyfriend and girlfriend discussing their anatomy, with the boyfriend making a comment about being glad he doesn't have to deal with periods, and the author responding that she doesn't want a penis.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The boyfriend started by making a comment about periods, which can be a sensitive topic. His remark that he's glad he doesn't have to deal with them and implies that having a vagina is a downside. Then he says something like \"I bet you wish you had a dick,\" which could be seen as a backhanded compliment or a way to minimize the difficulties of menstruation.\n\nThe author responds by saying she doesn't want a penis, explaining that she finds male genitals uncomfortable and inconvenient. The boyfriend gets offended, calling her sexist. The author argues that her comments are based on observations of her partner's habits, like scratching or adjusting his genitals, which she finds annoying. The boyfriend then storms off, making her question if she was wrong.\n\nNow, to assess if the author is in the wrong. The key points are: the initial comment by the boyfriend, the author's response, and the boyfriend's reaction. \n\nThe boyfriend's initial comment was dismissive of the challenges of having a vagina/periods and possibly a bit condescending. The author's response is her honest expression of her preferences and observations. She's not making a broad statement about all men or women but reflecting her personal experience and opinion. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction of calling her sexist seems misplaced here. The author isn't making a generalization about all men or women; she's talking about her own feelings towards having a penis. However, the boyfriend's comment about the author being sexist could be because he feels she's implying that male anatomy is worse, which could be seen as a form of sexism if it's a generalization. But in this context, the author is expressing her personal preference and observations based on her partner's specific behavior.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It depends on the intent and the context. If the author's statement was made in a respectful and honest manner, then she's not necessarily in the wrong. The boyfriend's reaction seems over the top, especially since he was the one who initiated the conversation by making a comment that could be seen as belittling the experience of having a period. The author's response was about her own preferences, not a generalization about all people. \n\nHowever, the line between personal preference and sexism can be thin. The boyfriend might feel that the author is making a value judgment about anatomy, which could be seen as sexist if it's a broad statement. But given the context, it's a specific conversation between partners. The author is not making a sweeping statement but expressing her own feelings based on her observations. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong here. The boyfriend's reaction seems to be a deflection from his initial dismissive comment about periods.\n"
