Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (a woman) is in the wrong for telling her boyfriend she doesn't want a penis. The situation is that during a period conversation, the boyfriend made a comment about being glad he didn't have to deal with it, then said she might wish she had a penis. She responded negatively, explaining she finds male genitalia uncomfortable. He got offended, called her sexist, and left.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend's initial comment seems dismissive of her experience with periods. He's making a joke about not having to deal with it, which might be insensitive. Then he implies she might wish she had a penis, which is a bit of a flip side\u2014maybe he's trying to downplay her discomfort by suggesting having a penis would be better. \n\nThe author's response is about her honest feelings towards male anatomy. She points out the discomfort and maintenance she observes in her boyfriend, like scratching or adjusting. He reacts by calling her sexist. That's where the conflict arises. The key here is whether her comments are sexist. Sexism typically involves prejudice based on gender, so if she's making a generalization about all men or their genitalia without evidence, that could be problematic. However, she's expressing a personal preference and observation about her own feelings towards male anatomy. \n\nIs it sexist to prefer not having male genitalia? If she's not making a derogatory comment about men as a whole, just stating her own preferences, then it's more of a personal opinion. The boyfriend might feel targeted because his own anatomy is being critiqued, but the author isn't saying all men are bad; she's just talking about the physical aspects. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction might stem from feeling attacked. When the author comments on the discomfort of his anatomy, he may perceive it as a personal attack rather than a general observation. Also, the initial joke about periods could have set a tone where he's trying to compare experiences, and she's pushing back against that.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author overstepped by expressing her personal view. If she's not making a sweeping judgment about men's worth based on their anatomy, but just stating her own perspective, then she's not necessarily in the wrong. The boyfriend's reaction of calling her sexist might be a misunderstanding or deflection. However, the argument might also be about communication styles. She could have approached it differently, but the content of her response doesn't inherently show sexism. \n\nThe boyfriend's initial comment was probably more dismissive, and the author's response is a valid expression of her feelings. So, the wrong might not be on her side. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
