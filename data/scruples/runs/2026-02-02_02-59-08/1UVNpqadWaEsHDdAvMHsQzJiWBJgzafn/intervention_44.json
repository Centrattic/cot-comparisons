Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a disagreement between the author and her boyfriend about not wanting to have a penis. The boyfriend made a comment about being glad he didn't have to deal with the author's period, and then said something like \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" The author responds that she doesn't, explaining that male genitalia seem uncomfortable and messy. The boyfriend gets offended and calls her sexist. The author then lists reasons why she finds male anatomy inconvenient, like scratching and adjusting, and he storms off.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The boyfriend was making a joke or a comment about the author's period, which is a sensitive topic. He said he's glad he doesn't have to deal with it, which could come off as dismissive of her experience. Then, he says \"I bet you wish you had a dick,\" which might be a bit of a provocative statement, especially during a period when she's already dealing with physical discomfort. The author's response is honest about her feelings towards male anatomy, which is a personal preference. \n\nThe boyfriend then challenges her, asking why she doesn't want a penis, and she explains her reasons. He gets offended and calls her sexist. This part is interesting. If the boyfriend is making a comment about the author's anatomy and then gets upset when she expresses a different perspective, it might be a case of him expecting her to agree with his viewpoint. The term \"sexist\" here is a bit tricky. Sexism is usually about prejudice based on gender, but in this case, the author is making a personal preference about anatomy, not making a general statement about genders. So maybe the boyfriend is mislabeling her comment as sexist when it's more about a personal opinion.\n\nThe author then lists specific examples of things the boyfriend does with his genitalia that she finds inconvenient, which supports her stance. The boyfriend storms off, indicating he's taking the conversation personally. The user initially thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides.\n\nThe key points are: the boyfriend's initial comment could be seen as trivializing her experience with periods, and his reaction to her honest opinion might be hypersensitive. The author's response is based on her personal comfort and observations. The boyfriend's accusation of sexism might be a deflection or a misunderstanding. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's possible that both have some faults. The boyfriend's initial comment might be dismissive, but the author's response is a straightforward statement of her preferences. However, calling someone sexist for expressing a personal preference about anatomy could be inappropriate. The author isn't making a broad generalization about all men or all women, just a personal choice. So in that sense, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. The boyfriend's reaction seems over the top, especially after he made a comment about her period. \n\nAnother angle: the author's response could be seen as a form of gender critique if taken in a broader context, but given the conversation is about personal anatomy, it's more of a personal opinion. The boyfriend's offense might stem from feeling his anatomy is being criticized, which he takes as a personal attack. However, the author is not criticizing him personally but rather expressing discomfort with certain anatomical features.\n\nIn conclusion, while both might have contributed to the conflict, the author's statements are about her personal experience and preferences, which are valid. The boyfriend's reaction seems more about feeling attacked than the author being in the wrong. So the answer might be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
