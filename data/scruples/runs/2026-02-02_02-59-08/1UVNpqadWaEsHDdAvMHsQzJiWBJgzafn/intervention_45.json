Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is that the author's boyfriend made a comment about being glad he didn't have to deal with her period and said something like \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" She responded with \"no, not really,\" explaining that male genitalia seem uncomfortable and awkward, like having \"meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches.\" He got offended and called her sexist, then she pointed out his own habits of scratching or adjusting, and he left angry.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author's response was inappropriate. The boyfriend's initial comment seems to be making a joke or a light-hearted dig about her period, which is a sensitive topic. When she says \"no, not really,\" it's a direct answer to his question. Then she gives her reasoning, which is about physical discomfort and aesthetics. \n\nThe boyfriend felt offended and called her sexist. Now, sexism typically involves prejudice or discrimination based on gender, often perpetuating harmful stereotypes. The author is expressing her personal opinion about the physical aspects of male genitalia, not making a generalized negative statement about all men or their worth. She's not saying men are inferior or that having a penis is bad, just that she doesn't want to have them for comfort reasons. \n\nHowever, maybe the issue is that he perceived her comment as a devaluation of his body or a form of gender-based criticism. If he's being defensive about his masculinity or feels that his body is being mocked, that could be why he's upset. On the other hand, the author is just sharing her honest feelings and pointing out the reality of what he's doing. \n\nThe boyfriend's initial remark was dismissive of her experience with periods, which can be seen as invalidating. The author's response is a counterpoint, perhaps making him aware that his body has its own maintenance aspects. But whether that's sexist or not is debatable. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a matter of perspective. The author isn't wrong for expressing her discomfort, but maybe she could have been more considerate in her wording. However, the boyfriend's reaction of calling her sexist and getting angry might be overreacting, especially since he was the one who brought up the topic in a potentially dismissive way. \n\nSo, considering that the author is stating her own preferences and pointing out his habits, she's not necessarily being sexist. The boyfriend's offense might stem from a place of defensiveness. Therefore, the answer might be B, that she's not in the wrong. But I need to be careful not to overlook any nuances. Maybe the way she phrased it was mocking, but \"hard pass\" is a casual expression of refusal, not an attack on his gender. So, she's not the one being sexist here. The boyfriend's initial comment could be seen as downplaying her experience, so his reaction might be unwarranted. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
