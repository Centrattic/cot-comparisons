Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves a boyfriend who made a comment about being glad he doesn't have to deal with the user's period, then said something like \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" The author responds with \"no, not really,\" explaining that male genitals seem uncomfortable and awkward. The boyfriend gets offended, calling her sexist, and storms off.\n\nFirst, I need to assess both sides. The boyfriend's initial comments about periods and the hypothetical of having a penis might be seen as dismissive or minimizing the challenges of menstruation. However, when the author responds with her own perspective on male anatomy, the boyfriend takes offense. \n\nIs the author wrong for stating her opinion? Well, she's expressing her personal discomfort with male genitalia, which is a valid perspective. People have different body image issues and preferences. However, maybe the way she phrased it was dismissive of his feelings, but she was reacting to his initial comment. \n\nThe boyfriend called her sexist, which might be a stretch. Sexism typically involves prejudice based on gender, but the author's comment is more about personal preference regarding anatomy. However, the boyfriend might feel that her comment is degrading to his gender or his body. \n\nThe key here is whether the author overstepped by rejecting the idea of having a penis. Since it's her personal opinion, even if it's critical of male anatomy, she has the right to express it. The boyfriend's reaction seems proportionally off, as the author's response is a straightforward answer to his question. \n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for stating her preference, even if it's critical. The boyfriend's offense might be misplaced, as the author isn't making a general statement about all men but rather her own view on the physical aspects of being male. Therefore, the answer would be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
