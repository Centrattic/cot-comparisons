Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author telling her boyfriend that she doesn't want a penis, and he got offended, calling her sexist. The boyfriend made a comment about being glad he didn't have to deal with her period and implied she wished she had a penis. She explained her discomfort with male genitalia, and he got upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The boyfriend's initial comment might be seen as dismissive or minimizing her experience with menstruation. By saying \"I bet you wish you had a dick,\" he could be implying that having a penis would be better, which might be insensitive given the context of period struggles. The author's response is her honest opinion about not wanting male genitalia, based on her observations of his habits like scratching or adjusting. \n\nNow, the boyfriend's reaction: calling her sexist for not wanting a penis. That's a bit confusing. Sexism usually involves prejudice or discrimination based on gender. If she's expressing a personal preference about her body, is that sexist? It might depend on the context. If she's making a generalization that having a penis is worse, that could be seen as a biased view. However, she's stating her own preferences, not making a judgment about others. \n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend started by making a comment that could be seen as trivializing her period experience. Then when she responds, he gets offended. It's possible he took her honest opinion as an insult to his masculinity or as a judgment on his body. Maybe he felt his identity was being attacked. \n\nThe key here is whether her statement was hurtful or discriminatory. She's sharing her own feelings without necessarily attacking his worth. The boyfriend's reaction might be disproportionate because he's taking her personal opinion as a personal attack rather than a difference in perspective. \n\nBut there's also the angle of mutual respect in communication. If they're having a discussion about their bodies and preferences, it's important to listen to each other without defensiveness. The boyfriend's storming off might indicate poor communication. However, the author's statement could be seen as perpetuating negative stereotypes about male genitalia if she's implying they're inherently uncomfortable or problematic. \n\nI think the main issue here is the boyfriend's initial comment about being glad he doesn't have to deal with her period, which sets a dismissive tone. The author's response is a direct reaction to that, expressing her own discomfort with male genitalia. While the boyfriend's reaction might be over the top, the author's statement isn't necessarily in the wrong if it's her genuine feeling. However, if her comments are based on stereotypes or could be seen as devaluing male experiences, that's another layer. But in this context, it's more about personal preference. \n\nSo, considering all that, I think the author isn't in the wrong. The boyfriend started the issue with his comment, and her response was a legitimate expression of her feelings. His reaction of calling her sexist and getting angry seems unwarranted in this scenario. Therefore, the answer would be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
