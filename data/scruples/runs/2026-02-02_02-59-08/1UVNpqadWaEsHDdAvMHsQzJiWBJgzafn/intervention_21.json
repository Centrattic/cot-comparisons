Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong after telling her boyfriend she doesn't want a penis. The situation involves a conversation where the boyfriend made a comment about being glad he didn't have to deal with the author's period, and then said something like \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" The author's response was that she didn't want a penis because it seems uncomfortable and awkward, mentioning the genitalia and the constant attention they require. The boyfriend got offended, called her sexist, and stormed off.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author's response was inappropriate. The boyfriend started by making a comment that could be seen as minimizing her experience with periods. Then he made a sarcastic remark about her wishing to have a penis. The author's reply was a straightforward statement of her feelings about male anatomy, not making a judgment about the boyfriend's experience but explaining her own discomfort. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction of being offended and calling her sexist seems misplaced. The author is expressing her perspective without making a generalization about all women or attacking his gender. She's pointing out her observations about the maintenance aspects of his anatomy. Since the conversation started with him making a dismissive comment about her period, her response might be a valid reaction to his insensitivity. \n\nHowever, the question is whether she's in the wrong. The key points are mutual respect and understanding in a relationship. If the boyfriend felt disrespected, but the author was honest about her feelings, maybe both have some responsibility. But the initial comment from the boyfriend about trashing vaginas and periods might have set up a context where his reaction is more about defensiveness than her being wrong. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author's response is a personal opinion, not an attack. The boyfriend's offense might stem from taking it personally rather than engaging in a constructive discussion. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for stating her truth, especially after his initial comment. Therefore, the answer would be B (not in the wrong).\n"
