Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is at fault in this situation. The scenario involves the boyfriend making a comment about not having to deal with periods, and then the author responding to his remark about not wanting a penis. The boyfriend got offended and accused her of sexism.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the context. The boyfriend made a derogatory comment about periods, which are a natural biological process. Then he made a flippant remark implying the author might wish she had a penis instead. The author's response was based on her personal observations about the discomfort and maintenance she sees the boyfriend experiencing with his genitalia. She's pointing out that having male genitals isn't all positive, which seems reasonable as a counterpoint.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction is to accuse her of sexism. That's problematic because he's dismissing her legitimate concerns. He's making a comparison between two different experiences. The author isn't saying one gender's experiences are worse overall; she's responding to his specific comment about not wanting to deal with periods by highlighting the downsides of his own anatomy. That's a valid point and not inherently sexist. She's expressing her perspective based on her observations, which is fair in a discussion.\n\nHe then storms off, implying he's upset, but his initial comments were dismissive of her experience with periods. The user is confused because he's upset over her honest response but was okay with his own negative comments. The author isn't being sexist; she's engaging in a back-and-forth about the challenges of different biological experiences. The boyfriend's offense seems misplaced and possibly hypocritical, given his earlier remarks.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author isn't in the wrong for expressing her honest opinion about her preferences. The boyfriend's reaction is the issue here, as he's being defensive and not acknowledging her valid points. Sexism would involve making a generalized negative statement about a gender, which the author isn't doing. She's making a personal choice statement, which is her right. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
