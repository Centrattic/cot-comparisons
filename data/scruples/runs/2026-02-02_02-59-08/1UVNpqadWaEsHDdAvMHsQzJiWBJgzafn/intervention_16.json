Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's boyfriend made a comment about being glad he didn't have to deal with periods, and then said something like \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" The author responded that she doesn't want a penis because it seems uncomfortable and awkward, citing things like scratching and adjusting. The boyfriend got offended and called her sexist, leading to an argument.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The boyfriend's initial comment was about not having to deal with periods, which could be seen as dismissive or minimizing the experience of menstruation. Then he makes a joke suggesting the author might wish she had a penis, which can be interpreted as a form of period shaming or implying that being female is worse because of menstruation. The author's response is a straightforward expression of her personal discomfort with male genitalia, pointing out the maintenance aspects like scratching or adjusting. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction is to get offended and call her sexist, which is a bit confusing because he started by making a comment that could be seen as sexist himself. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides. \n\nThe author is stating her preference and experiences honestly. She's responding to his initial jab with her own perspective. Saying she doesn't want a penis is a personal choice and not a direct attack on him. The boyfriend's offense might stem from feeling that his anatomy is being criticized, but the author is talking about her own feelings and observations. \n\nThe boyfriend's initial comment could be seen as making light of a natural bodily function and implying that having a penis is preferable. The author's response is a critique of the maintenance and discomfort associated with male genitalia, which is a valid point. However, the boyfriend perceiving this as sexism is a misinterpretation. He's taking her personal opinion as a judgment against him as a male, which isn't necessarily the case. \n\nIn terms of who is in the wrong, it seems like the boyfriend initiated the argument with a dismissive and potentially sexist comment. The author is responding to that with her own perspective. While the author's statement might be blunt, it's a sincere expression of her feelings. The boyfriend's reaction of storming off and calling her sexist is more about defensiveness than a constructive dialogue. \n\nSo, considering the sequence of events, the boyfriend's initial comment was problematic, and the author's response is a reasonable reaction. The boyfriend's offense is misplaced, making him the one in the wrong here. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
