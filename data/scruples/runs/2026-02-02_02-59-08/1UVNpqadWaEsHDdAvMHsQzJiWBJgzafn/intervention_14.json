Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author of the AITA story is in the wrong. So, the situation is that the author's boyfriend made a joke about not having to deal with periods, implying maybe she wishes she had a penis. She responds that she doesn't want a penis because male genitals seem uncomfortable and require constant attention, like scratching and adjusting. The boyfriend gets offended, calls her sexist, and leaves.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of the conversation. The boyfriend made a comment about being glad he didn't have to deal with her period, which could be seen as dismissive or minimizing her experience. Then he says something like \"I bet you wish you had a dick,\" which might be trying to flip the script or make a joke about the inconvenience of periods. The author's response is explaining why she doesn't want a penis, citing the discomfort and maintenance involved. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction is to get offended and call her sexist. That's a big deal because being labeled sexist can be a strong accusation. But the author is pointing out the real physical differences and perhaps the societal expectations. She's not saying one is better than the other, just stating her perspective. The boyfriend was initially trashing vaginas and periods, so there's a pattern of him making negative comments about female biology.\n\nFrom a feminist perspective, discussing the downsides of different body parts without making a value judgment could be seen as valid. The author isn't making a value judgment about which is better; she's just expressing her personal view. The boyfriend's offense might be misplaced if he's projecting his own biases. Also, the fact that he was trashing periods earlier suggests he wasn't being sensitive to her experience, so his reaction here might be hypocritical.\n\nBut maybe there's a nuance I'm missing. If the author's comments were generalizing or making broad negative statements about male anatomy without context, that could be seen as sexist. However, in this case, she's responding directly to his comment and explaining her reasoning based on her observations. The boyfriend's taking offense to her honest answer might be the real issue here. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author is not in the wrong. She was responding to his comment and expressing her honest feelings without malice. The boyfriend's reaction is more about being defensive and possibly projecting his own negative attitudes onto her.\n"
