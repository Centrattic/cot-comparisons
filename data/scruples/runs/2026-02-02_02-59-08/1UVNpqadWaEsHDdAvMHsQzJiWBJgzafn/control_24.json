Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling her boyfriend she doesn't want a penis. The situation involves the boyfriend making a joke about being glad he doesn't have to deal with periods and implying she might wish she had a penis. The author responds by saying that male genitals seem uncomfortable and awkward, leading to the boyfriend getting offended and calling her sexist.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The boyfriend's comment about being glad he doesn't have periods and the joke about her wishing to have a penis might come from a place of insensitivity. He's making light of something (periods) that many find challenging, which could be dismissive. The author's response is about her personal feelings towards male anatomy, which she finds uncomfortable. She's not making a general statement about all men or all penises, just her own preference. \n\nWhen the boyfriend accuses her of sexism, that's a serious claim. Sexism involves prejudice or discrimination based on gender. The author is expressing a personal preference, not making a judgment about the worth or capabilities of men. She's not saying men are better or worse, just that having male genitalia isn't appealing to her. However, the boyfriend might feel that by criticizing male anatomy, she's devaluing his gender, which could be his reasoning for calling her sexist.\n\nBut is the author actually sexist? Her comments are based on her observations of the physical discomforts associated with male genitalia. She points out that he scratches or adjusts his genitalia frequently, which she finds annoying. That's a personal opinion about anatomy, not a judgment about gender roles or capabilities. So, maybe the boyfriend is mislabeling her comments as sexist when they're actually about personal preferences.\n\nThe boyfriend's initial comments about periods and implying she wishes to have a penis might be more problematic. Making light of someone's experience with periods can be seen as dismissive. If he's trashing vaginas and periods, that's a different kind of insensitivity. The author's response is addressing the flip side of the argument, pointing out the discomforts of male anatomy. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author is expressing her honest feelings. The boyfriend's reaction of getting offended and calling her sexist might be disproportionate. Unless the author's comments were directed at his identity or worth as a man, she's within her rights to express her preferences. However, if her comments were generalizing all men's experiences, that could be different. But from her description, it's her own perspective.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. She's responding to his comments with her own views, which are valid. The boyfriend's reaction seems more about defensiveness over his own anatomy or perhaps a misunderstanding of what sexism entails. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
