Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling her boyfriend she doesn't want a penis. \n\nFirst, the boyfriend made a comment about being glad he didn't have to deal with her period and said something like \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" The author responds with \"no, not really,\" and explains that male genitals seem uncomfortable and awkward to her. The boyfriend got offended and called her sexist.\n\nSo, the key points here are the boyfriend's initial comment and the author's response. The boyfriend was trashing periods and vaginas by implying that having a penis would be better. The author is expressing her genuine discomfort with male genitals, which is a personal preference. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction seems to stem from taking her comment as an attack on his body or masculinity. But the author is not attacking his body; she's stating her own feelings. The boyfriend's initial comment was dismissive of her experience with periods, which is a valid issue. \n\nThe author isn't making a generalization about all men or their bodies; she's talking about her own perspective. Sexism would involve prejudice or stereotyping based on gender. Since she's not making a broad statement but rather expressing her own preferences, it's more about personal opinion than sexism. \n\nThe boyfriend's offense might be because he feels his body is being criticized, but the author isn't saying his body is wrong, just that she doesn't want that. It's a difference in perspective, not a sexist remark. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. Her response was a legitimate expression of her feelings in response to his initial comment. The boyfriend's reaction seems disproportionate and possibly rooted in defensiveness about his own body or gender norms.\n"
