Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author told her boyfriend she doesn't want a penis, finding male genitalia uncomfortable. The boyfriend got offended, calling her sexist, and the author is confused because he was making negative comments about periods earlier.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The boyfriend made a comment about being glad he didn't have to deal with periods and said something like \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" The author responded that she doesn't want a penis because it seems uncomfortable and awkward. The boyfriend took offense, called her sexist, and stormed off.\n\nSo, the key points here are mutual criticism. The boyfriend starts by making a comment that can be seen as dismissive or minimizing her experience with periods. The author responds by expressing her discomfort with male anatomy, which the boyfriend interprets as sexist. Now, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for her response.\n\nI should think about what constitutes sexism. Sexism is prejudice or discrimination based on sex, especially against women. But in this case, the author is making a personal preference statement, not making a general negative statement about men. She's talking about her own feelings towards having male genitalia, perhaps based on observations of her boyfriend's behavior. \n\nThe boyfriend's initial comments about periods might be seen as trivializing her experience. Then, when she challenges his perspective by pointing out the discomfort she observes in him, he takes it as sexism. That might be a case of him projecting his own potentially sexist remarks onto her. \n\nAlso, the author is not making a generalization about all men but is expressing a personal opinion. The boyfriend's reaction could be defensiveness rather than a valid response. \n\nHowever, could there be a situation where discussing anatomy in such a way is inappropriate? Maybe if it's dismissive or derogatory, but the author is stating her personal stance. The boyfriend's offense seems more about being criticized rather than the content of her statement.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author is not in the wrong. She was responding to his initial comment and expressing her own perspective. The boyfriend's reaction might stem from his comments about periods first. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
