Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their boyfriend they don't want a penis. The situation involves a conversation where the boyfriend makes a comment about being glad he doesn't have to deal with the author's period and says something like \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" The author responds with \"no, not really\" and explains that male genitalia seem uncomfortable and messy. The boyfriend gets offended, calls her sexist, and storms off.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of their conversation. The boyfriend started by making a comment that could be seen as dismissive or even a bit misogynistic. He was trashing periods and vaginas, which are natural and important parts of the female body. His initial remark might be contributing to a toxic environment where women's experiences are belittled. \n\nThe author's response is a direct reaction to his comment. She expresses her genuine feelings about not wanting to have a penis, citing discomfort and the constant attention required. Her reasoning seems based on personal observations of her partner's behavior. While the comparison might not be entirely balanced (as male genitalia also have their own care needs, but perhaps presented as more burdensome in her view), her perspective is her own.\n\nNow, the boyfriend's reaction of being offended and calling her sexist is interesting. His taking offense might stem from feeling that the author is making a generalization or a value judgment about male anatomy. However, in this context, his initial comments were already devaluing women's experiences. The author's response is a form of pushing back against that. \n\nIn terms of sexism, the boyfriend's original comments could be seen as more problematic. He was using the author's period as a negative, implying that it's something to be glad he doesn't have to deal with. This is a common form of gender-based criticism where women's biological functions are viewed as inferior or burdensome. The author's response is a defense of her own perspective, pointing out the discomfort of male anatomy as a counterpoint. \n\nIs the author being sexist by not wanting a penis? Not necessarily. Preferences and comfort with one's body are personal. She's not making a broad statement about all men but rather expressing her own views. The boyfriend's label of her being sexist seems misplaced here, especially given his own earlier comments. \n\nIn terms of the question of who is in the wrong, the boyfriend's initial remarks were more hurtful, and his subsequent reaction is defensive. The author is reacting to his statement, which he initiated. The situation seems more about differing perspectives and communication issues rather than one party being objectively wrong. However, the boyfriend's reaction might be part of a pattern of dismissing women's experiences, which can be toxic.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong for expressing her perspective. The boyfriend's comments and reaction are more concerning. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
