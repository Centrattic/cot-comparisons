Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is between the author and her boyfriend. The boyfriend made a comment about being glad he doesn't have to deal with periods, and said something like the author might wish she had a dick. She responds that she doesn't, explaining that male genitalia seem uncomfortable and awkward. The boyfriend gets offended and calls her sexist. The author is confused because earlier he was making negative comments about vaginas and periods, which he seemed okay with.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics here. The boyfriend starts by making a derogatory comment about periods, which are a natural part of the female body. Then he suggests that having a penis would be better, implying that the author's current state (being female) is inferior. The author responds by expressing her discomfort with male genitalia, which the boyfriend takes as sexist. \n\nNow, the key points are about mutual respect and how each person perceives the other's comments. The boyfriend's initial comments about periods and implying that having a penis is better could be seen as sexist or dismissive of the challenges women face. The author's response is a counterpoint, highlighting the discomforts of male anatomy. The boyfriend then labels her as sexist for pointing that out. \n\nI need to consider whether the author's response is a valid reaction. If the boyfriend was making a jab at her gender or menstrual cycle, the author's defense of her own body and pointing out the downsides of the other gender's anatomy could be a legitimate response. However, the boyfriend's offense might come from feeling that his anatomy is being criticized, even if it's in the context of a comparison. \n\nBut then again, if the conversation started with the boyfriend being dismissive of her experience (periods), the author's reaction is a way to highlight that there are downsides to both. The boyfriend's taking offense might be because he didn't expect the conversation to be reciprocal. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, maybe the boyfriend initiated the problematic comments by trashing her experience, and the author is just pointing out the other side. However, the author's comment about male genitalia being uncomfortable might be a generalization or could be hurtful if taken personally. \n\nBut given that the boyfriend first made negative remarks about her body and her natural processes, the author's response is a form of pushing back against that. So, is the author in the wrong for responding to his initial disrespect? Or is the boyfriend wrong for making the initial comments and then getting upset when confronted?\n\nI think the boyfriend's initial comments were more problematic. The author is responding to his jab, not making a general statement about all men. Therefore, the author might not be in the wrong. However, the way the author phrases her response could be seen as dismissive of the boyfriend's experience. But considering the context, the author is defending her own body against his criticism. So the answer might be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
