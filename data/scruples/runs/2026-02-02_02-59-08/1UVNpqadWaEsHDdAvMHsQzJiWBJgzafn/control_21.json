Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the girlfriend telling her boyfriend she doesn't want a penis, and he gets upset, calling her sexist.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The boyfriend made a comment about being glad he didn't have to deal with her period and said she might wish she had a dick. She responded negatively, explaining that male genitalia seem uncomfortable. He took offense, called her sexist, and got angry. She points out that he was criticizing female biology moments before.\n\nSo, the key points here are mutual criticism. The boyfriend made a comment that could be seen as dismissive or trivializing her experience with periods. The girlfriend responded by expressing her own discomfort with male genitalia, which he found offensive. The question is whether her response was wrong.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, both made comments that could be seen as putting down each other's biology. The girlfriend's statement is a personal opinion about her body preferences. She's not making a generalization about all women, just stating her own view. However, the boyfriend interpreted it as sexist, which might be a stretch unless she made a broader statement. On the other hand, his initial comment about periods could be seen as minimizing her experience, which isn't helpful.\n\nThe girlfriend's response is a direct reaction to his comment. She's pointing out the discomfort she observes in his body maintenance, which is a specific example rather than a sexist statement. The boyfriend's reaction seems to be defensiveness rather than a valid point about sexism. \n\nSo, considering the context, the girlfriend wasn't in the wrong for expressing her personal opinion, especially in response to his initial dismissive remark. The boyfriend's reaction seems disproportionate. Therefore, the answer would be B (No).\n"
