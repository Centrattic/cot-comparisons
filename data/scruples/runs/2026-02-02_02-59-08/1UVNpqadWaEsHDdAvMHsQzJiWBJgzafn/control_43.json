Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a couple having a discussion about not wanting to have a penis, and the boyfriend reacting negatively, calling her sexist. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The boyfriend made a comment about being glad he didn't have to deal with periods and implied that the author might wish she had a penis. She responded that she doesn't, explaining that male genitalia seem uncomfortable and awkward. He got offended and called her sexist.\n\nNow, the key here is whether the author's statement was sexist. Sexism typically involves prejudice or discrimination based on gender. The author is expressing a personal preference or observation about the physical aspects of male anatomy, not making a generalized negative statement about all men or their worth. \n\nThe boyfriend's initial comment was dismissive of the challenges of menstruation and implied a negative about having a vagina. The author's response is about her own body and her preference not to have certain anatomy. She's not making a claim about all women or all men, just her personal view. \n\nHe being offended might stem from feeling that critiquing male anatomy is equivalent to sexism, but that's a stretch. The author is not devaluing his gender, just his anatomy. The boyfriend's reaction could be defensiveness about his own body, but the author's right to express her opinion isn't wrong. \n\nAlso, the boyfriend's initial comments were also problematic. He dismissed the experience of having a period, which is a valid issue. The author pointing out his own comments before getting defensive might show she's not attacking his gender but pointing out double standards.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. Her response is a personal preference, not sexism. The boyfriend's reaction is misplaced. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
