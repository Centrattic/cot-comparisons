  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for telling my boyfriend I don't want a penis?\nThis whole argument is really weird to me. Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple discussing their anatomy. The boyfriend made a comment about being glad he didn't have to deal with the woman's period, then joked about her wishing she had a penis. She responds that she doesn't want male genitals because they seem uncomfortable, like having \"meat and a nut sack\" in her pants. He gets offended and calls her sexist. She argues that he's trashing vaginas and periods, which he thought was okay.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze who is right. The woman is expressing her personal preference and her observations about male genitalia being inconvenient. She's not making a general statement about all women, just her own feelings. The boyfriend, on the other hand, made a comment that implied he thought having a period was worse, then got upset when she didn't want his anatomy. He called her sexist, which might be a misapplication of the term because she's not expressing bias against a group, just her personal view. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction seems to be about feeling disrespected or perhaps his masculinity being challenged. But the woman is just stating her honest opinion. Also, he was the one who started by trashing her body's natural functions. So, her response is a valid reaction to his comment. The key here is whether her statement was sexist. Since she's not generalizing all women, but speaking for herself, it's not sexist. The boyfriend's reaction is over the top. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
