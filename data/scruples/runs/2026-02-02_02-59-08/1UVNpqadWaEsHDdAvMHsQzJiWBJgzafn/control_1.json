Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong after telling her boyfriend she doesn't want a penis. The boyfriend made a comment about being glad he didn't have to deal with her period, then said something like \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" She responded with \"no, not really,\" explaining that male genitalia seem uncomfortable and awkward. He got offended, called her sexist, and left.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend's initial comment was dismissive of her period, which is a common women's health issue. Then he flipped it to imply she might want a penis, which could be a form of gaslighting or minimizing her experiences. The author's response was a straightforward expression of her discomfort with male anatomy. She's pointing out the practicalities she observes in him, like scratching or adjusting, which she finds annoying. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction to being called sexist is interesting because his own comment could be seen as sexist, suggesting that having a period is worse than having a penis. The author isn't making a judgment about gender; she's just stating her personal preference based on her observations. \n\nThe key here is whether her statement was sexist. She's not making a generalization about all men or women, just expressing her own feelings. The boyfriend's offense might stem from a defensiveness about his body or feeling that his experience is being compared unfavorably. However, the original question is about who's in the wrong. \n\nThe boyfriend made the initial sexist comment about periods, then the author responds to his implication. Her response is a valid personal opinion, not an attack on his gender. The boyfriend's reaction of calling her sexist and storming off might be an overreaction. \n\nSo, considering the context, the author isn't in the wrong. She's responding to his comment, and her reasons are based on her own observations and preferences. The boyfriend's behavior\u2014trashing periods and then getting upset about her response\u2014suggests he might be the one with issues. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
