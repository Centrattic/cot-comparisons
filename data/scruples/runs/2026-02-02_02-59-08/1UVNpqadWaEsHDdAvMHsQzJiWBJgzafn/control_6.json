Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the boyfriend made a comment about being glad he doesn't have to deal with the author's period, and then said something like \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" The author responds that she doesn't, explaining that male genitalia seem uncomfortable and awkward. The boyfriend gets offended, calls her sexist, and leaves. The author is confused because he was making fun of vaginas and periods earlier.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The boyfriend started the conversation by making a dismissive comment about the author's period, which is a valid and common experience. Then he made a joke about wishing she had a penis. The author's response is her honest opinion about not wanting male genitalia, which seems like a personal choice and not an attack on him. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction is to accuse her of sexism. That's interesting because he was the one making a gendered comment about her body. Sexism usually involves prejudice based on someone's gender. If the author is expressing a preference or discomfort related to anatomy, is that sexist? Probably not. She's not making a generalization about all men or women, just stating her own feelings.\n\nThe boyfriend might be feeling defensive because his own anatomy is being discussed, but that doesn't necessarily mean the author is wrong. The initial comment from the boyfriend was probably more problematic, as he was trivializing the author's experience with her period. Then he expects her to not be offended when he makes a joke about her body, but when she does express her discomfort with male anatomy, he takes it as an attack. That seems inconsistent.\n\nAlso, the fact that he was making fun of vaginas and periods earlier shows that he was already engaging in behavior that could be seen as disrespectful. The author's response is a direct reaction to his comment, so she's not out of line for expressing her feelings. The boyfriend's offense seems more about his own ego or sensitivity rather than a valid point about sexism.\n\nIn terms of communication, the boyfriend's approach of storming off and making the author \"think about\" his feelings might be a manipulation tactic, which isn't healthy. The author is just stating her perspective, and unless she was making a generalization or attacking his identity, she's not in the wrong. The key here is whether her statement was a personal opinion versus a sexist remark. It sounds like a personal opinion, so she's not in the wrong.\n"
