Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is between a girlfriend and boyfriend. The boyfriend made a comment about being glad he didn't have to deal with her period and joked that she must wish she had a penis. She responded \"no, not really,\" and then explained that she doesn't want male genitalia because they seem uncomfortable and require constant attention. He got offended, called her sexist, and stormed off.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the context. The boyfriend started by making a comment about her period, which he's glad he doesn't have to deal with. That's a bit dismissive of her experience. Then he said \"I bet you wish you had a dick,\" which is a bit of a flip statement. His comment might come off as trivializing her perspective. The author's response is that she doesn't want a penis because of the discomfort and maintenance involved. That seems like a genuine, if blunt, opinion. \n\nHe then presses her for reasons, and she gives her reasons. He gets upset, calls her sexist. Is that fair? Sexism usually involves prejudice based on gender. The author is expressing a personal preference about her body, not making a generalized negative statement about men's bodies. She's stating her own desire, not making a judgment about men or women. So his reaction might be overreacting. \n\nHe also mentions that she was trashing vaginas and periods earlier. Wait, the user says the boyfriend was trashing vaginas and periods. Wait, the user says \"Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons?\" So she's pointing out that he was criticizing female bodies and periods, which is problematic, but she didn't call him out on it. Now he's upset about her comment about not wanting male genitalia. \n\nSo the dynamic here is that he made a joke about her body and her period, which she found dismissive. Then when she expressed her own preference about not wanting male genitalia, he called her sexist. His reaction seems hypocritical, given that he was criticizing her body first. \n\nIs there a double standard here? The author is expressing her preference, which is a personal choice. The boyfriend is taking offense to her stating her preference, but he made a joke that was potentially derogatory towards her experience. So the author's response is valid because she's just explaining her reasoning without making a judgment about his body. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? If the boyfriend made a comment that was trashing her body, then the author's response is self-expression. The boyfriend's reaction is inappropriate because he's calling her sexist for stating her own perspective. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
