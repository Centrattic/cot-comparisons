Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling her boyfriend she doesn't want a penis. Let me start by reading the situation again.\n\nThe boyfriend made a comment about being glad he didn't have to deal with her period, and he said something like \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" She responded with \"no, not really,\" and gave her reasons about male genitals being uncomfortable and that she doesn't want that in her pants. He got offended, called her sexist, and stormed off. The author is confused because he was making negative comments about vaginas and periods earlier, but now she's in the wrong?\n\nFirst, I need to consider communication in relationships. Both parties should be able to express their views respectfully. The boyfriend's initial comment about being glad he doesn't have to deal with periods is dismissive and maybe minimizing her experience. Then he makes a joke about her wishing to have a penis. That's a bit of a flip response. \n\nThe author's response is to say she doesn't want a penis because of discomfort and the idea of constantly having to manage genitalia. She's pointing out the downsides from her perspective. He reacts by labeling her as sexist, which seems like a deflection. His reaction is more about being defensive than addressing her points. \n\nThe key here is mutual respect. The author is expressing her opinion based on her observations, like how he scratches his nuts or adjusts his genital area, which she finds annoying. He's upset, but his initial comments were also negative towards her anatomy and the experience of menstruation. \n\nIs there an issue with the author's statement? She's stating her preference, which is valid. Sexism usually involves prejudice based on gender. Here, she's making a specific comment about not wanting male anatomy, which is a personal choice, not a generalization about all men or women. Her boyfriend's reaction seems to be more about feeling criticized rather than an actual sexist remark from her. \n\nThe boyfriend's behavior in the scenario includes making trashing comments about vaginas and periods, which is problematic. The author is responding to his initial jab, so her response is a direct reaction to his comment. It's a back-and-forth where each is reacting to the other's statements. \n\nIn a healthy relationship, both partners should be able to discuss such topics without accusations of sexism. The author isn't making a broad sexist statement; she's expressing her personal preference and pointing out the discomforts she observes. The boyfriend's offense might stem from him feeling defensive or maybe his comment was meant to be a joke that backfired. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. She's responding to his initial comment and sharing her viewpoint. The boyfriend's reaction is more about his own defensiveness and maybe a projection of his earlier comments about her anatomy. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
