Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend made a comment about being glad he didn't have to deal with the author's period, and said something like \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" The author responded with \"no, not really,\" which led to a deeper discussion where she explained that male genitalia seem uncomfortable to her. The boyfriend got offended and accused her of being sexist. The author is confused because she feels he was trashing vaginas and periods earlier.\n\nSo, the key points here: The boyfriend made a sarcastic or dismissive comment about her period, which the author found trashing. Then when she refused to desire having a penis, he got upset and called her sexist. The author is defending her stance by pointing out the maintenance involved with male genitalia, like scratching or adjusting.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the boyfriend's initial comment was probably dismissive or mocking towards her period. The author then expresses her genuine feelings about not wanting male genitalia, which is a valid perspective. The boyfriend's reaction seems hypocritical because he was being negative about her body and then took offense when she expressed a different view about his. \n\nBut maybe the author could have handled it differently? Like, was her response hurtful? She said male genitalia are awkward and uncomfortable, but that's a personal opinion. He accused her of sexism, which might be because he felt she was making a general statement about all men's bodies. However, she was responding to his personal comment. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the boyfriend's behavior seems more problematic because he was making negative comments about her body and then reacted negatively to her expressing her own view. The author's response is about her personal preference, not a broad sexist statement. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer might be B, No.\n"
