Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong after telling her boyfriend she doesn't want a penis. The situation started with the boyfriend making a comment about being glad he didn't have to deal with her period, then saying she might wish she had a penis. She responds that she doesn't want male genitalia because it's uncomfortable and awkward, referencing things like scratching and adjusting. He gets offended, calling her sexist, and storms off.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if her response was inappropriate. The boyfriend's initial comments seem dismissive of her experience with periods, which is a valid issue. He's making a comparison that seems to trivialize her monthly discomfort. Her response is about her personal feelings towards male anatomy, which she finds inconvenient. She's expressing her own preferences and observations based on what she sees him do. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction is to label her as sexist. That's a strong accusation. Sexism typically involves prejudice or discrimination based on gender. Here, she's expressing a personal preference, not making a judgment about the worth of either gender. She's not saying one gender is better than the other, just that she doesn't want male genitalia. It's a matter of personal choice and comfort, not a sexist statement.\n\nHe's upset because she's not conforming to his expectation that having male anatomy is desirable. Maybe he feels his comment was a joke or a way to bond, and her honest response upset that dynamic. But her response is factual and based on her observations. She's not attacking his gender; she's just stating her perspective. \n\nThe boyfriend's initial comment about being glad he doesn't have to deal with periods is more problematic. That's a form of minimizing her experience, which could be seen as dismissive or even sexist. He then tries to flip the script by suggesting she should want a penis, which she clearly doesn't. His getting angry and calling her sexist seems like a deflection from his own initial dismissive remarks.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. She's responding honestly to his comment, and her reasons are valid. The boyfriend's reaction is misplaced because he's not addressing his own initial insensitivity. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
