Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The situation involves a boyfriend who made a comment about being glad he didn't have to deal with the author's period. The author then says they don't want to have a penis, explaining that male genitals are uncomfortable. The boyfriend gets upset and calls her sexist. The author is confused because he previously made negative comments about vaginas and periods.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author was wrong in her response. The boyfriend made a sarcastic or dismissive comment about periods, which can be seen as trivializing her experience. The author responded by stating her preference not to have a penis, which is a personal choice based on her observations and comfort. She's pointing out the perceived downsides of male genitalia, which he found offensive. \n\nNow, the boyfriend's reaction: he accuses her of being sexist. That's a bit of a stretch because she's expressing her own preference without making a generalization about all men or their genitalia. He might be defending his own body or feeling attacked. However, his initial comments about periods were probably not appropriate, so there's a back-and-forth here.\n\nThe key points are mutual disrespect. The boyfriend starts with a comment that could be seen as minimizing her experience with periods. The author responds with her own opinion about male anatomy, which is a personal choice. The boyfriend's offense might be about being judged, but his initial remark was also judgmental towards the author's body and experience. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? She was responding to his comment, which was inappropriate. Her response is her honest opinion. Unless she made a generalization or a harsh judgment about his gender based on his anatomy, she's not being sexist. She's talking about her own preferences. So, she's not in the wrong. The boyfriend's reaction is misplaced, given that he initiated the conversation with his own judgmental remark. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong)."
