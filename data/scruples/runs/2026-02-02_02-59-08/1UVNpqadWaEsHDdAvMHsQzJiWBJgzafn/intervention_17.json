Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author telling her boyfriend she doesn't want to have a penis, and he's upset, calling her sexist.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The boyfriend made a comment about being glad he didn't have to deal with the author's period and implied she might wish she had a penis. The author responds by saying she doesn't want male genitals because they seem uncomfortable and awkward, like having \"meat and a nut sack\" in her pants. He gets offended, calls her sexist, and storms off.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong for expressing her discomfort with male anatomy. The boyfriend is upset because he feels her statements are sexist towards men. But the author is responding to his initial comment which was dismissive of her experience with periods. \n\nI should consider the dynamics here. The boyfriend made a joke or a comment that trivializes the author's experience with menstruation. Then she responds by expressing her genuine discomfort with male anatomy. He takes it as an attack, hence the reaction. \n\nNow, is the author wrong? Well, she's expressing her own views and observations. She's not making a direct attack on his anatomy but rather stating her perspective. Her comments are based on her observations of his body maintenance habits. The boyfriend might feel that she's making a generalization or being derogatory about male anatomy, which he perceives as sexist. However, the initial comment from him about periods seems dismissive and possibly condescending. \n\nSo, if he was criticizing her experience, then her response is a counterpoint. Whether it's appropriate is debatable. But the key point is whether her statement is sexist. Sexism involves prejudice or discrimination against someone based on their sex. If she's making a generalization that all male anatomy is uncomfortable, that could be seen as a negative stereotype. However, she's expressing her personal preference, not making a broad negative generalization about all men. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction might stem from feeling that she's invalidated his experience by comparing the discomfort of periods to the supposed discomfort of having a penis. But she's not equating the two; she's just stating her own perspective. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's about mutual respect. She has the right to express her views, and he has the right to feel upset if he perceives it as an attack. However, the initial comment from him was probably the more problematic one, as it dismissed her experience. \n\nSo, considering all that, I think the author is not in the wrong. She's responding to his comment with her own perspective. The boyfriend's reaction might be over the top, especially since he was the one who initiated the discussion with a potentially dismissive remark. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
