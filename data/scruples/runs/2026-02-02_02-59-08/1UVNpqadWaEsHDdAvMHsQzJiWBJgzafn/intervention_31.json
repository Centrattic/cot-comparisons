Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is that the boyfriend made a joke about not having to deal with the author's period and said something like \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" The author responds with \"no, not really,\" and later explains that male genitals seem uncomfortable and awkward to have. The boyfriend then gets offended and claims she's being sexist. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants opinions.\n\nHmm. First, I need to analyze the situation. The boyfriend's initial comment seems dismissive or maybe even a bit sexist, right? Saying he's glad he doesn't have to deal with periods and implying maybe she should have a penis. But the author's response is honest about her discomfort with male genitalia. She's not saying having a penis is worse overall, just that the physical aspects are uncomfortable. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction is to get mad and call her sexist. That might be a problem. If he made a comment that could be seen as degrading to women (periods, vaginas), and the author points out the discomforts of male anatomy, maybe he misinterpreted her as being biased against men. But is she justified in her response? She's expressing a personal preference, not making a general statement about all men or their worth. \n\nSo, the question is whether her response was respectful or if it was indeed sexist. Since she's talking about her own feelings and observations, like the need to scratch or adjust, that's a factual statement. But maybe the context matters. If the boyfriend was already being dismissive, his reaction could be a deflection. The author isn't in the wrong for stating her honest opinion, especially if he was the one making the initial joke. \n\nI think the boyfriend's issue is more about being insulted by her response, but the author was responding to his comment. If he's trying to make her feel bad for not wanting to have a penis, maybe he's in the wrong for bringing up the topic in a way that's trying to belittle her experience. The author is not wrong for expressing her discomfort with something she doesn't have, especially if he was the one who started the comparison. \n\nSo, answer B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
