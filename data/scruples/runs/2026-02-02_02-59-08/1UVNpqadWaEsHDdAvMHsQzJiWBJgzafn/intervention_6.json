Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author told their boyfriend they don't want a penis, and he got offended, calling her sexist. The author is confused because he was making comments about periods and vaginas. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics here. The boyfriend made a comment implying that not having a penis is better, like being glad he doesn't have to deal with periods. Then the author responds that having male genitals seems uncomfortable. He gets upset and calls her sexist. \n\nSo, the key points here are mutual disrespect. The boyfriend was making light of periods and female anatomy, which can be a sensitive topic. The author is pointing out the discomforts of male anatomy, which is a valid response. But he's taking offense, claiming sexism. \n\nIs the author being sexist? Probably not. She's expressing her personal opinion about preferring her anatomy. The boyfriend's initial comments were dismissive of periods, which can be seen as misogynistic. The author is correcting his assumption that not having a penis is a negative, which he implied by saying \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction seems to stem from defensiveness. He was making a joke or comment that trivializes menstruation, and when the author pushes back, he frames it as sexism. But he's the one who started by making a gendered comment. \n\nSo, the author is responding to his initial remark. She's not making a blanket statement about all women but is expressing her own feelings. The boyfriend's offense seems misplaced because he initiated the conversation with a comment that's not respectful. \n\nIn terms of whether the author is in the wrong, it's about mutual respect. If the boyfriend was making disrespectful comments, the author is within her right to push back. He called her sexist, but his own comments were sexist. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No), the author is not in the wrong because she's responding to his initial disrespectful remarks and expressing her own valid perspective without making a sexist claim.\n"
