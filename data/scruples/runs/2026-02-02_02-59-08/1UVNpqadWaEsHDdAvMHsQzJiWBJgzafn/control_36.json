Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author, who's a woman, tells her boyfriend she doesn't want a penis. The boyfriend made a comment about being glad he didn't have to deal with her period and said something like \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" She responds with \"no, not really,\" and then explains why she doesn't want male genitalia, finding it uncomfortable and awkward. The boyfriend gets offended, calls her sexist, and storms off.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The boyfriend made a derogatory comment about periods and implied that having a penis is better. The author is pushing back against that, stating her own preference. She's not saying that having a penis is worse, just that she personally doesn't want it. Her reasoning is based on her observations of his behavior, like scratching or adjusting, which she finds annoying.\n\nNow, the boyfriend is upset and calls her sexist. Is her statement sexist? Sexism usually involves prejudice or discrimination based on gender. If she's making a generalization about all men or all people with penises, that could be problematic. But here, she's talking about her own personal feelings. She's not making a sweeping statement about all women not wanting penises, just expressing her own preference. She's also responding to his previous comments that seem to devalue her experience (periods) and imply that having a penis is better.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction seems to be deflection. He started the conversation by dismissing her experience with periods, and when she challenges his implication that having a penis is better, he gets upset. His offense might be more about being called out on his sexist remarks rather than her actual statement. By saying she doesn't want a penis, she's rejecting the idea that having a penis is superior, which could be threatening to his ego or the assumptions he made.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It doesn't seem like it. She's responding to his comments, which were likely sexist, by expressing her own perspective. Her comments are based on her observations and personal preferences, not a generalization. The boyfriend's reaction of calling her sexist might be a way to shut down the conversation rather than address his own remarks. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
