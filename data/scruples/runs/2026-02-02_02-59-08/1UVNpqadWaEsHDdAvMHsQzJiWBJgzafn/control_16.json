  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for telling my boyfriend I don't want a penis?\nThis whole argument is really weird to me. Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation involves a boyfriend and girlfriend having a discussion about body parts and preferences.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend makes a comment about being glad he doesn't have to deal with the girlfriend's period and says something like \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" The girlfriend responds that she doesn't want a penis, explaining that male genitalia seem uncomfortable and awkward. She lists reasons like having to deal with them constantly, like scratching or adjusting. The boyfriend gets offended, calls her sexist, and storms off.\n\nNow, to figure out if she's in the wrong. The key points here are mutual respect in a relationship and whether her comments were sexist. She's expressing her personal preferences based on her observations. She's not attacking his identity as a man but stating her own comfort with her body. He called her sexist, but she's just sharing her perspective.\n\nThe boyfriend initially made a derogatory comment about periods and vaginas, which is not respectful. The girlfriend is pushing back against his dismissive attitude towards her experience. She's not making a generalization about all people but is specific to her own feelings. There's a lot of back and forth, but her reasons seem valid. She's not making a harmful stereotype; she's explaining her personal view.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction seems over the top. If he was offended by her stating her preference, maybe he needs to reflect on why he was dismissive first. The girlfriend's response was a legitimate reaction to his initial comment. So, she's not in the wrong. The answer is B.\n"
