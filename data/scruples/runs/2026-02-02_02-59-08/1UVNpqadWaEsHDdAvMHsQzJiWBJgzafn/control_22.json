Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the boyfriend made a comment about being glad he doesn't have to deal with periods and said something like \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" The author responds that they don't really want a penis, explaining that male genitalia seem uncomfortable and messy. The boyfriend got offended, called her sexist, and stormed off.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author's response was appropriate. The boyfriend's initial comment is a bit dismissive of her experience with periods and maybe a bit of a jab at her anatomy. The author's response is about her personal preference and discomfort with male genitalia. She's not making a general statement about all men or all bodies, just her own feelings. \n\nThe boyfriend seems to take offense, but why? The author is expressing her own preferences, not attacking his identity. He had made a joke about her being a woman (periods), and she's pushing back by saying she doesn't want a penis. Maybe he felt it was an insult, but it's more about her honest feelings. \n\nIs there a double standard here? The boyfriend was trashing vaginas and periods, which are serious issues, and then he's upset when she doesn't want his anatomy. That seems inconsistent. The author is pointing out the hypocrisy. \n\nAlso, when the author states her reasons (like the discomfort of having to deal with genitalia), that's a personal opinion. People have different body types and preferences, and it's not her fault she feels that way. The boyfriend calling her sexist might be a misapplication of the term; sexism is about prejudice against others, not personal preferences. Unless she's making a judgment about all men, which she doesn't seem to be. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is defending her own choices and pointing out the boyfriend's earlier dismissive comments. He's taking offense to her truth, which he shouldn't. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
