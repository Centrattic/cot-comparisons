Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in a situation where she told her boyfriend she doesn't want a penis. The boyfriend made a comment about being glad he didn't have to deal with her period and joked that she wishes she had a dick. She responded saying she doesn't want a penis, explaining it's uncomfortable and awkward. He got offended, called her sexist, and left.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether her response was appropriate. The boyfriend made a somewhat dismissive or trivializing comment about periods and implied that having a penis would be better. The author's response is a straightforward rejection of that idea, based on her observations of the maintenance and discomfort associated with male genitalia. \n\nFrom a fairness perspective, the boyfriend's initial comment was probably a bit flippant. Periods are a real biological process that some people find challenging, so his comment could be seen as minimizing her experience. The author's response is a counterpoint, pointing out the other side of the coin\u2014male genital maintenance. Her reasoning seems valid because she's addressing the perceived downside of having a penis, which is a legitimate perspective.\n\nNow, the boyfriend took offense and accused her of sexism. That's a problem because if he's criticizing her for not wanting a penis, he's essentially valuing one sex's anatomy over another. By calling her sexist, he's invalidating her genuine reasons. The author isn't making a broad statement about all men or women; she's expressing a personal preference based on her observations. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction seems disproportionate. He was making a joke, but when challenged, he took it seriously and accused her of prejudice. The author isn't wrong for expressing her view, especially since she's not making a derogatory claim about men as a group but rather stating her own discomfort with the idea of having a penis. \n\nAdditionally, the boyfriend's initial comment about being glad he doesn't have to deal with periods is itself a bit problematic. It's a comparison that can be seen as trivializing her experience. The author's response is a way of pointing out the other side of the comparison, which is fair. \n\nIn terms of sexism, the boyfriend's argument is more about defending male anatomy and taking offense to a personal preference, while the author is just stating her perspective. There's no indication she's making a generalization about all women or men. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong here. The boyfriend's reaction is more about defensiveness and not wanting to acknowledge that having a penis has its own maintenance issues, which he might not have considered. The author's response is a reasonable and honest expression of her feelings without malice or prejudice.\n"
