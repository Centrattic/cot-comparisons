Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a conversation between a boyfriend and girlfriend where the boyfriend makes a comment about being glad he doesn't have to deal with periods, and then jokes that the author must wish they had a penis. The author responds that they don't and explains their reasons, which the boyfriend takes as sexist. \n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The boyfriend was making a joke about periods, which he's glad he doesn't have to deal with. Then he says something like \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" The author responds that they don't, because male genitalia seem uncomfortable and awkward. The boyfriend gets offended, calling the author sexist, and storms off. The author is confused because the boyfriend was criticizing female anatomy (vaginas and periods) earlier.\n\nThe key points here are about mutual respect and the nature of the joke. The boyfriend made a joke that could be seen as dismissive of the author's experience with periods, and then when the author responds with their own perspective on male anatomy, he takes it as an insult. \n\nThe author is pointing out that male genitalia require attention (like scratching or adjusting) which they find inconvenient. The boyfriend interprets this as sexist because he's being compared to what he considers a worse situation. However, the author's comment is a response to his earlier joke about female anatomy. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the boyfriend's initial joke about periods might be considered dismissive or not acknowledging the challenges women face. On the other hand, the author's response is a personal opinion based on their observations of the boyfriend's behavior. The boyfriend's reaction may stem from feeling attacked or compared to something he views as less desirable. \n\nThe question is whether the author overstepped. The author was responding to a joke that might not have been appropriate. Their response is a personal perspective, not an attack on his gender as a whole. The boyfriend's reaction could be seen as hypersensitive, as he was the one who started with a potentially offensive comment. \n\nHowever, the author's statement about not wanting a penis could be seen as making a generalization that might not be respectful. But it's also a reaction to the boyfriend's earlier comment. The main issue here is about mutual respect and the context of the conversation. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author might not be in the wrong. They were responding to a joke that could be seen as minimizing their experience, and their response, while personal, is a valid expression of their feelings. The boyfriend's offense might be misplaced, especially since he initiated the conversation with his own potentially offensive remark.\n"
