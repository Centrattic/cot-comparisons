Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is that the author's boyfriend made a comment about being glad he didn't have to deal with periods, implying that having a penis is better. The author then responds that she doesn't want a penis because male genitalia seem uncomfortable, leading to an argument where the boyfriend accuses her of being sexist.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of their conversation. The boyfriend made a comment that could be seen as minimizing the challenges of menstruation, which is a common issue many women face. By saying \"I bet you wish you had a dick,\" he's implying that having a penis would be preferable, perhaps dismissing the difficulties associated with female reproductive health. The author's response is a rejection of that idea, stating her reasons based on her observations of his behavior and the discomfort she associates with male genitalia.\n\nNow, the boyfriend gets offended and calls her sexist. Is the author being sexist by not wanting to have a penis? Sexism typically involves prejudice or discrimination based on gender. The author is expressing a personal preference, not making a judgment about the worth or capabilities of men or women. She's pointing out specific, observable discomforts she associates with male genitalia, like needing to scratch or adjust them. That seems like a personal opinion rather than a sexist statement.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend's initial comment might have been dismissive of the author's experience with periods, which is a valid point. The author is pushing back against his minimization of her experience by stating that she doesn't value having a penis. Her argument is about her own preferences and experiences, not about devaluing men as a gender. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction seems disproportionate. He accuses her of sexism but was the one who brought up the comparison in the first place. If the author had made a statement that generalized all men or women negatively, that could be considered sexist. But her comments are about her personal feelings and observations. It's possible he's taking offense because his own gender identity or ego is being challenged, rather than a legitimate sexist remark.\n\nAnother angle is communication styles. The author's directness might have been unexpected or hurtful. However, given the context, her response was a reaction to his comment. The key here is whether her statement was an expression of personal preference or a sexist generalization. Since she's talking about her own desires and reasons based on her observations, it's more about personal choice.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong. She's defending her perspective based on her experiences and observations, and the boyfriend's reaction seems to stem from his own defensiveness. The initial comment from the boyfriend was dismissive and likely more problematic. Her response is a legitimate expression of her feelings, not sexism.\n"
