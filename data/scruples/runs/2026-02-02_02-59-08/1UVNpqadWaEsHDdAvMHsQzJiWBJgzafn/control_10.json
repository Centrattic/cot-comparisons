Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe boyfriend made a comment about being glad he didn't have to deal with periods and implied that the author might wish she had a penis. The author responded that she doesn't want a penis because male genitalia seem uncomfortable to her. The boyfriend got offended and called her sexist. The author points out that he was previously making negative comments about vaginas and periods.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author's response was appropriate. The boyfriend's initial comment was dismissive of her experience with menstruation and made a joke about her wanting a penis. The author's reply is a straightforward expression of her discomfort with male genitalia, which is a valid personal preference. She's not making a generalization about all men or all people with penises, just stating her own feelings.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction seems to be that she's being sexist, but sexism involves prejudice against someone based on their sex. The author isn't targeting people based on their sex; she's expressing a personal preference about body parts. Her comments are about her own desires and observations, not about judging others based on their gender. \n\nAlso, the boyfriend's initial comments about periods and vaginas being a problem could be seen as contributing to the tension. He might be coming from a place of insensitivity towards her experiences, which the author is now pushing back against. His taking offense might be a deflection from his own comments. \n\nThe key here is whether the author's statement was discriminatory. Since she's not making a sweeping judgment about all people with male anatomy but rather explaining her personal discomfort, it's more of a personal opinion than sexism. The boyfriend's offense might stem from feeling criticized about his own anatomy, but that doesn't make her wrong. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. She's asserting her own boundaries and preferences, which is her right. The boyfriend's reaction seems more about his own defensiveness than her being sexist. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
