Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a couple discussing their body parts and preferences. The boyfriend made a comment about being glad he didn't have to deal with the author's period, and then joked about her wishing she had a penis. The author responded that she didn't want male genitalia because they seem uncomfortable and awkward. The boyfriend took offense, called her sexist, and got upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The boyfriend started by making a light-hearted comment about not having to deal with periods and implying that having a penis would be better. The author's response was based on her personal discomfort with male genitalia, which she explained by pointing out the maintenance and awkwardness. \n\nThe key points here are the boyfriend's initial remarks and the author's response. The boyfriend's comment about periods is a sensitive topic, but the author is responding to his assertion that having a penis would be preferable. Her response is her honest opinion about not wanting male genitalia, which is a valid personal preference. \n\nThe boyfriend's offense might stem from feeling that his body or gender is being criticized. However, the author isn't making a broad statement about all men or male genitalia in a derogatory way; she's stating her own perspective based on her observations. She's pointing out the physical aspects that she finds inconvenient, which is a personal viewpoint, not an attack on men as a whole. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction of calling her sexist could be an overreaction. Sexism involves prejudice or discrimination based on gender. The author's comments are about her own body preferences, not making a judgment about the worth of men or their bodies. She's not suggesting that men are inferior, just that she doesn't want to have male genitalia for her own reasons.\n\nAdditionally, the boyfriend's initial comment about periods being a downside of having a vagina might contribute to the tension. He's making a comparison between genders, and the author is pushing back by highlighting the downsides of male anatomy from her perspective. It's a back-and-forth of each pointing out what they see as drawbacks of the other's biology.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author was responding to a joke about her body and expressing her own views. She isn't in the wrong for stating her personal preference. The boyfriend's reaction is more about his feelings being hurt rather than the author being incorrect. The author's explanation of why she doesn't want male genitalia is a legitimate personal opinion, even if it's not politically correct or sensitive to how some might interpret it. \n\nHowever, the line about scratching and rearranging might be a bit crass, but it's part of her reasoning based on her observations. The boyfriend's offense might be due to the specific wording rather than the underlying message. Still, the author isn't spreading a harmful stereotype; she's sharing her personal discomfort. \n\nOverall, the author isn't in the wrong. She was responding to her boyfriend's comment with her own perspective, which is valid. The boyfriend's reaction could be a case of him being defensive or misunderstanding the context. So, the answer should be B (No).\n"
