Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author, who is a woman, telling her boyfriend that she doesn't want a penis. The boyfriend made a comment about being glad he didn't have to deal with her period and said something like \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" She responded with \"no, not really,\" and explained that she finds male genitals uncomfortable and awkward. He got offended, called her sexist, and stormed off.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the dynamics here. The boyfriend made a dismissive comment about her period and then made a joke about her wishing she had a penis. The author is responding to his comment, stating her honest opinion. She's expressing her personal preferences without imposing on him. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction seems to stem from taking offense at her honest opinion. He called her sexist, which might be a misapplication of the term. Sexism typically involves prejudice based on gender, but here the author is expressing a personal preference, not making a judgment about the worth of either gender. \n\nThe boyfriend's initial comment was trashing vaginas and periods, which is dismissive and not okay. The author's response was about her own preferences, not about him. The boyfriend's reaction is over the top because he's taking her honest opinion as an attack, when it's just a statement of fact. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong here. She was responding to his comment and sharing her perspective. The boyfriend's behavior was more problematic because he was making disrespectful remarks about her body and then getting upset when she didn't agree with his viewpoint. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
