  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for telling my boyfriend I don't want a penis?\nThis whole argument is really weird to me. Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author of this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about the author telling her boyfriend she doesn't want a penis. The boyfriend made a comment about being glad he didn't have to deal with her period, then said something like \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" She responded with \"no, not really,\" explaining that male genitals seem uncomfortable to her. He got offended, called her sexist, and left.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether her response was appropriate. The boyfriend's initial comment was dismissive of her period and possibly condescending. When she says she doesn't want a penis, he reacts with offense. But the author's reasoning is about comfort and practicality, not about denigrating men or their anatomy. She's pointing out observations like him scratching or adjusting his genitals, which could be a valid point about personal experience versus anatomy.\n\nIs her statement sexist? Sexism typically involves prejudice or discrimination based on gender. Here, she's expressing her personal preference and experiences, not making a generalized negative statement about men. She's talking about her own views on anatomy, not making broad negative claims about the entire gender. So, it doesn't sound like sexism.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction seems to be defensiveness rather than valid concern. He was trashing periods and vaginas earlier, then gets upset when she doesn't want his anatomy. His offense might stem from not wanting to confront his own biases. The situation seems more about his inability to handle criticism of his initial comments rather than her being wrong.\n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong. She's standing up for her own experiences and preferences, which is a valid right. The answer should be B (No).\n"
