Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation involves a boyfriend and girlfriend having a conversation about not wanting to have a penis. The boyfriend made a comment about being glad he didn't have to deal with periods, and then said something like \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" The woman responds that she doesn't really want a penis because she finds male genitals uncomfortable and messy. The boyfriend got offended and called her sexist, then stormed off.\n\nHmm, so the main question is whether the woman is in the wrong. Let's break this down. The boyfriend made a joke about not having to deal with periods, which could be seen as dismissive or minimizing her experience. Then he says she wishes she had a penis. The woman's response is based on her observations of his genital maintenance, like scratching or adjusting. She's saying she finds that uncomfortable and doesn't want that part of having a penis. \n\nThe boyfriend called her sexist. Sexism usually involves prejudice or discrimination based on gender. The woman's comment is about her personal preference and observations, not about making a generalized negative statement about men based on their gender. She's expressing her own feelings about having a penis, which is a personal choice, not a judgment about all men. So maybe the boyfriend is misinterpreting her statement as sexist when it's actually about her own preferences.\n\nAlso, the boyfriend was trashing vaginas and periods earlier. That's definitely problematic behavior. He's dismissing the challenges of menstruation, which is not okay. So the woman is pointing out the double standard here. He's upset about her not wanting a penis, but he's already devaluing her experience with periods. That seems hypocritical.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the woman is expressing her genuine feelings about her body and preferences. It's her right to have that opinion. The boyfriend's reaction is more about defensiveness and possibly not wanting to hear critique of his own experiences or habits. His calling her sexist is an overreaction. The woman isn't making a generalization about all men; she's talking about her own thoughts. \n\nSo the answer here would be B, No. The author isn't in the wrong. She's defending her perspective, and the boyfriend's reaction is misplaced. He's the one being sexist for dismissing her experience with periods and then getting offended by her honest response.\n"
