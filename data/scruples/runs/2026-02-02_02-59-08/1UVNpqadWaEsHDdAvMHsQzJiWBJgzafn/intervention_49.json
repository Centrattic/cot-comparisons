Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author telling her boyfriend she doesn't want a penis, and he got offended, calling her sexist.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The boyfriend made a comment about being glad he didn't have to deal with periods and said something about the author wishing she had a dick. The author then expressed her discomfort with male genitalia, which the boyfriend took as sexist. \n\nThe author is arguing that male genitalia require more maintenance, like scratching and adjusting, which she finds annoying. The boyfriend, on the other hand, was trashing vaginas and periods earlier. \n\nI should think about whether the author's response was a valid reaction. She's stating her personal preference and observations. If someone comments on another's body in a negative way, it's reasonable to push back. The boyfriend's accusation of sexism might be misplaced if she's not making a generalization about all men but rather expressing her own views. \n\nHowever, the key here is whether her statement was sexist. Sexism involves prejudice or discrimination based on gender. If the author is making a judgment about male genitalia without generalizing men as a whole, it's more about personal preference than sexism. The boyfriend's reaction might stem from feeling personally attacked, especially since he was criticizing her body earlier.\n\nThe author isn't saying all men are inferior, just that she prefers her own anatomy and finds male genitalia inconvenient. That doesn't seem inherently sexist. The boyfriend's defensiveness and the comparison to his earlier comments about vaginas and periods suggest he might be overreacting. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It seems like she's just expressing her honest feelings, which are valid. The boyfriend's reaction is more about feeling criticized rather than a legitimate sexist remark. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
