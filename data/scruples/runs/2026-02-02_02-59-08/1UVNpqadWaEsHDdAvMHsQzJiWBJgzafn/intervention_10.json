Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author of the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation is about the author telling her boyfriend she doesn't want a penis. The boyfriend made a comment about being glad he didn't have to deal with her period and said something like \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" She responds with \"no, not really,\" and then explains why, mentioning the discomfort and maintenance of male genitalia. He gets offended, calls her sexist, and storms off. The author is confused because he was making fun of vaginas and periods, but he's upset about her opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The main issue here is whether the author's response was appropriate. The boyfriend made a flip comment implying that having a penis would be better because he avoids dealing with periods. She counters by expressing her discomfort with male anatomy. He reacts negatively, calling her sexist. \n\nSo, is she in the wrong? Well, the boyfriend's initial comment was dismissive and perhaps sexist, as he's trivializing her experience with periods. His remark \"I bet you wish you had a dick\" implies that having a penis is better, which can be seen as a form of sexism. The author's response is a direct and honest reaction to his comment. She's pointing out the downsides of male anatomy that he's not considering. \n\nWhen he gets offended and calls her sexist, that's hypocritical because his initial comment was sexist. He's upset about her valid critique, which shows he may be in denial about his own sexism. The author isn't in the wrong for defending her perspective, especially since his comment was the catalyst for the argument. \n\nAlso, the boyfriend's reaction is disproportionate. He storms off and tells her to think about why his comment was upsetting, which is unfair. The author's stance is justified because she's responding to his sexist remark with her own perspective. Therefore, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
