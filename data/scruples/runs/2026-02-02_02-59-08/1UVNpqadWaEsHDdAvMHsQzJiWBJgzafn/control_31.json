Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the boyfriend made a comment about being glad he doesn't have to deal with her period, and then said something like she might wish she had a penis. She responds that she doesn't want a penis, finding male genitalia uncomfortable and awkward. He then gets offended and says she's being sexist.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The boyfriend's initial comment was dismissive of her period, which is a natural biological process. His remark about her wishing to have a penis seems like a backhanded compliment or a way to minimize her experience. The author's response is a direct and honest reaction to that comment, expressing her discomfort with male anatomy. \n\nNow, the boyfriend is offended and called her sexist. Is her response actually sexist? Sexism would involve prejudice based on gender, but here she's making a personal preference about her own body. She's not making a sweeping generalization about all women or men. Instead, she's explaining why she doesn't want to have a penis, based on her observations of his actions (like scratching or adjusting). That seems like expressing individual choice rather than systemic bias.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend's initial comments could be seen as downplaying the validity of her experiences with menstruation. By bringing up the penis comment, he might be implying that having a penis would be better, which could be a form of gender bias. The author pushing back against that is defending her experience and her body's natural processes. \n\nIs there a double standard here? The boyfriend was okay with making a comment about female anatomy (vaginas and periods) but not about male anatomy. The author's response highlights that inconsistency. Sexism isn't just about criticizing one gender; it can also be about dismissing the experiences of one gender while the other is criticized. \n\nThe key here is whether the author's statement is discriminatory. She's not devaluing men or making a judgment about male superiority or inferiority. She's simply stating that she finds male genitalia inconvenient. The boyfriend's reaction might stem from defensiveness about his own body being criticized, but that doesn't necessarily mean she's wrong. \n\nThis scenario is similar to when someone makes a joke about another's body and gets upset when their own body is the subject of humor. The author is just returning the same level of criticism she received. So, the boyfriend's offense might be misplaced, especially since he initiated the conversation by making a comment about her anatomy. \n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't being sexist by expressing her discomfort with male anatomy. The boyfriend's initial remarks were more problematic because they trivialized her experience. Her response is a valid expression of her own perspective and preferences. Therefore, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
