Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the boyfriend made a comment about being glad he doesn't have to deal with periods, implying maybe the author wishes she had a penis. She responds that she doesn't, explaining that male genitalia seem uncomfortable and awkward. The boyfriend gets offended, calls her sexist, and storms off. The author is confused because the boyfriend was criticizing vaginas and periods before.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The boyfriend's initial comment was dismissive or negative about periods, which is a common female experience. His remark could be seen as minimizing her experience. The author's response is about her personal discomfort with male genitalia, based on observing the boyfriend's behavior. She's expressing her own preference or opinion, not making a direct attack on him personally. \n\nThe boyfriend reacts strongly by calling her sexist. Is her statement sexist? Sexism involves prejudice or discrimination based on gender. The author is stating a personal preference, not making a generalized negative statement about all men or their bodies. She's talking about her own feelings and observations. So maybe her comment isn't sexist, but a personal opinion. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction might be stemming from feeling attacked, even if the author wasn't intending to generalize. However, his initial comment was also making a negative comparison. The question is whether the author overstepped by expressing her discomfort with male genitalia. Since she was responding directly to his comment, and it's her personal view, it's probably justified. \n\nBut wait, could her comment be seen as body-shaming? If she's making negative remarks about male genitalia, even if it's based on her own perspective, maybe that's where the issue is. However, the boyfriend initiated the conversation by trashing periods and vaginas. So the dynamic here is that he's criticizing female biology, and she's pushing back by criticizing male anatomy, which he takes as sexist. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author was expressing her feelings, which is valid. The boyfriend's response of being offended might be an overreaction, especially since he started the comparison. The fact that he was okay with making negative comments about her anatomy but got upset when she did the same could indicate a double standard. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong for stating her own preference and reasoning in response to his comment. The boyfriend's reaction seems disproportionate and possibly rooted in defensiveness rather than a genuine valid concern. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
