Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author told her boyfriend she doesn't want a penis, and he got offended, saying she's sexist. The author argues that her boyfriend was making negative comments about periods and vaginas, so she was just responding to that.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points here. The boyfriend made a comment implying that having a penis is better because he doesn't have to deal with periods. The author responds by expressing her discomfort with male genitalia, which leads to a conflict. The boyfriend feels offended and calls her sexist, while the author feels she's just being honest about her preferences.\n\nNow, considering the context. The boyfriend started the discussion by making a dismissive comment about periods and implying that not having a vagina is better. The author's response is about her own preferences regarding having a penis, which she finds uncomfortable. The boyfriend's reaction seems to be about taking offense to her honest opinion, especially after he made his own comments about women's bodies.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The main factors here are mutual disrespect and the context of the conversation. The boyfriend's initial comments could be seen as sexist, so the author's response might be a justified reaction to his remarks. However, the author's statement about not wanting a penis could be seen as a personal preference, not a sexist statement. The boyfriend's offense at her opinion, especially after making his own negative comments, might indicate that he's being hypersensitive or inconsistent.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, it's important to consider who escalated the conflict and who's being more disrespectful. The boyfriend's original comments are problematic, and the author's response is her expressing her own views. The boyfriend's reaction seems disproportionate, especially since he was the one who initiated the conversation with a sexist remark. Therefore, the author might not be in the wrong here. The answer would likely be B (No), as the author's response is a personal opinion and a reaction to her boyfriend's initial comments. The boyfriend's offense is misplaced given his own behavior."
