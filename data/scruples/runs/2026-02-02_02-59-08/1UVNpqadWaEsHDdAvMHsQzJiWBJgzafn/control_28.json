Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about a disagreement between the author and her boyfriend where she expresses discomfort with having male genitalia. The boyfriend gets offended and calls her sexist. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The boyfriend made a comment about being glad he doesn't have to deal with periods and implies that having a penis is better. The author responds by saying she doesn't want a penis, finding it uncomfortable. The boyfriend reacts negatively, calling her sexist, which leads to an argument.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong (answer A) or not (B), I need to consider the context and the appropriateness of her statements. The boyfriend's initial comments were dismissive of periods and female anatomy, which the author is countering. She's expressing her personal opinion about preferring not to have male genitalia, which could be seen as a valid personal preference. However, the boyfriend perceives it as sexist, possibly because he feels she's making a negative judgment about male anatomy in a way that's disrespectful.\n\nBut here's the thing: when the author states her preference, she's not making a generalization about all men or their worth; she's talking about her own feelings towards the physical aspects. The boyfriend's reaction might stem from feeling personally attacked, but the author's statement is about her own desires, not a broad sexist statement. \n\nOn the other hand, could the author's comment be seen as sexist? It might depend on how it's phrased. If she's generalizing all men or their bodies in a derogatory way, that's different. But in this case, she's sharing her personal discomfort, not making a judgment about the gender. The boyfriend's comparison of periods versus male genitalia seems to be a back-and-forth where both are making light of each other's experiences. \n\nThe boyfriend's initial comment about periods could be considered dismissive or minimizing, which is part of the problem. The author's response is a reaction to that. So, the boyfriend's offense might be more about the back-and-forth rather than her statement being inherently sexist. \n\nIn terms of whether she's in the wrong: if her comment was a direct, personal opinion without attacking his gender, then she's not wrong. The boyfriend's reaction might be hypersensitive, especially since he was the one who started the conversation by trashing periods. However, if there was a specific way her comment crossed into sexist territory, that's different. But from the given text, she's expressing her own preferences, not making a broad sexist statement. \n\nTherefore, the author is not in the wrong for stating her personal view. The boyfriend's reaction seems misplaced, especially given his own initial comments. So the answer would be B.\n"
