Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is a disagreement between the author and her boyfriend about whether she would want to have a penis instead of a vagina.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend made a comment about being glad he didn't have to deal with periods and joked about her wishing she had a penis. She responds that she doesn't really want a penis because she finds male genitalia uncomfortable and messy, like the testicles and the need to constantly adjust them. The boyfriend gets offended, calls her sexist, and storms off.\n\nSo, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are the context of the discussion and the appropriateness of her response. The boyfriend started by trashing periods and vaginas, which is a sensitive topic. The author is expressing her genuine discomfort with male anatomy, which could be seen as a personal preference rather than a sexist statement. She's pointing out the practical aspects she finds inconvenient, like adjusting genitalia. However, the boyfriend perceives this as sexist, which might come from a place of defensiveness or feeling that any negative comment about his anatomy is discriminatory. \n\nBut is she actually being sexist? Sexism involves prejudice based on gender. If she's making a generalization about male anatomy without considering individual differences, maybe. However, she's stating her personal experience and observations, like seeing him adjust his genitalia. That seems more like a personal preference or opinion rather than a sexist generalization. The boyfriend's reaction of calling her sexist could be overreacting, especially since he was the one who initiated the conversation by criticizing her female anatomy and periods. \n\nThe AITA community often looks at who started the conflict and whether the response was proportionate. Here, the author's response was to a derogatory comment about her gender-related experiences. Her reply about not wanting a penis is a direct answer to his hypothetical, and she's explaining her reasoning. The boyfriend's offense might be misplaced, especially since he was the one who brought up the comparison. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. Her response is a personal opinion based on her observations, and the boyfriend's reaction seems to stem from defensiveness rather than valid sexism. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
