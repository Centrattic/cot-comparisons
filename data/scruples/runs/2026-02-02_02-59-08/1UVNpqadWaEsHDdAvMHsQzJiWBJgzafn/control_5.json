Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author telling her boyfriend she doesn't want a penis. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The boyfriend made a comment about being glad he doesn't have to deal with the author's period and said something like \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" The author responded that she doesn't want a penis because male genitals seem uncomfortable and awkward. She lists reasons like having to deal with them scratching or adjusting them multiple times a day. The boyfriend got offended and called her sexist, then stormed off.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Let me break it down. The boyfriend's initial comment was probably making a joke or a backhanded compliment about her period. The author is expressing her honest opinion about not wanting male genitalia. She's pointing out the physical discomforts she observes in her boyfriend. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction might stem from feeling criticized. He could perceive her comments as a negative judgment of his body or his experiences. However, the author is stating her own preferences and observations. She's not making a blanket statement about all men, just her own feelings about having a penis. \n\nThe boyfriend's claim of sexism might be a stretch because the author is talking about her own desires and experiences, not making a generalization about all women or about men. Sexism would involve prejudice based on gender, but here she's just expressing a personal choice. \n\nThe boyfriend's initial comment about periods being a burden and implying that having a penis is better could be seen as dismissing the challenges of being female. The author is pushing back against that by pointing out the downsides of male anatomy. \n\nIt seems like both are expressing their viewpoints, but the boyfriend's reaction is more about taking offense to what he perceives as criticism. The author isn't wrong for stating her opinion, especially since it's a personal preference and not a derogatory statement towards men. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B\u2014she's not in the wrong. She's defending her stance and providing reasons for her preference, which is valid.\n"
