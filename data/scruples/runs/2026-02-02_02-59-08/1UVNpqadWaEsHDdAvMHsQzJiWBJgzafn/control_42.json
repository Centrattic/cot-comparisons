Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the boyfriend made a comment about being glad he didn't have to deal with periods, and said something like \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" The author responds with \"no, not really,\" and explains why they don't want male genitalia, finding it uncomfortable. The boyfriend gets upset, calls her sexist, and storms off.\n\nHmm. First, I need to consider the context. The boyfriend's initial comment was probably a bit flippant or dismissive of the author's experience with menstruation. Then, when the author refuses to want a penis, he takes offense and accuses her of sexism. \n\nIs the author wrong to express her genuine feelings about male anatomy? I think it's about personal preference. She's stating her own perspective, not making a generalization about all people. Sexism usually involves prejudice based on gender, but here she's talking about her own preferences regarding body parts. \n\nThe boyfriend might be feeling that by not wanting his anatomy, she's devaluing men or male experiences. But she's not saying male anatomy is worse, just that she doesn't want it for herself. It's more about her own comfort and preferences. \n\nHe also made a comment about periods being a problem, which is a topic that's often trivialized. The author is pushing back against that. So maybe the boyfriend was being dismissive of her bodily experiences, and she's defending her own viewpoint. \n\nIs there a double standard here? If the boyfriend criticizes periods but then gets upset when she criticizes male anatomy, maybe he's not being consistent. It seems like he expected her to desire male anatomy despite his earlier put-down about her period. \n\nSo, the author isn't being sexist; she's just stating her own preferences. The boyfriend's reaction might be about defensiveness regarding his own body or not wanting to be criticized. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
