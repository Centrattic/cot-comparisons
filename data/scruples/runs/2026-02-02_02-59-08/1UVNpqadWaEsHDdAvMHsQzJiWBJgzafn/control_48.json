Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong when they told their boyfriend they don't want a penis. The boyfriend made a comment about being glad he didn't have to deal with periods, and then said something like \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" The author responded negatively, explaining that male genitalia seem uncomfortable. The boyfriend got offended, called her sexist, and left.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The boyfriend made a casual, perhaps flippant comment about not having to deal with periods, which is a common issue women face. Then he made a joke about wishing she had a penis. The author's response is a genuine expression of her discomfort with male genitalia, citing things like needing to scratch or adjust them. She's being honest about her preferences. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction seems disproportionate. He called her sexist, which might not be accurate because she's not making a broad judgment about all men, just expressing her own feelings about a body part. He was trashing vaginas and periods earlier, which is more objectively problematic. The author is defending her own perspective, and the boyfriend's offense seems more about his ego than the content of her statement. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't violating any social norms here. It's about personal preference. The boyfriend's reaction is more concerning because mocking someone's anatomy or their experiences (like periods) is more harmful. The author's statement is a personal choice, and it's not sexist to have preferences about body parts. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
