Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about the author telling their boyfriend they don't want a penis. The boyfriend got offended and called her sexist.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the interaction. The boyfriend made a comment about being glad he didn't have to deal with periods and said something like \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" The author responded negatively, explaining that male genitalia seem uncomfortable and awkward. The boyfriend then got upset, called her sexist, and left.\n\nSo, the main points here are the boyfriend's initial comment, the author's response, and the boyfriend's reaction. The question is whether the author was wrong in expressing her opinion.\n\nI should consider if the author's response was a valid reaction. The boyfriend's comment seems dismissive of her experience with periods, which can be a sensitive topic. By saying she doesn't want a penis, she's pointing out the discomforts of male anatomy. The boyfriend's offense might be because he felt she was belittling his body, but his initial comment was devaluing her experience.\n\nIs there any sexism here? The boyfriend's comment about periods and his flip response could be seen as trivializing a legitimate health issue. The author's response is about the physical aspects of having a penis, which she finds inconvenient. She's not making a value judgment about gender but stating her observations.\n\nThe boyfriend calling her sexist might be deflection. He was making a joke at her expense, and her pointing out the discomforts is a reasonable counter. He might be upset because he feels his body is being criticized, but he initiated the conversation with a comment that minimized her experience.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author had the right to express her honest feelings. The boyfriend's reaction seems disproportionate, especially since he started the conversation with a degrading remark. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
