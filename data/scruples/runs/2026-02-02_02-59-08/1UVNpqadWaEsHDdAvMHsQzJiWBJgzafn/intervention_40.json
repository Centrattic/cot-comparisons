Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a boyfriend and girlfriend discussing the idea of having a penis versus a vagina. The boyfriend made a comment about being glad he didn't have to deal with periods and joked about the woman wishing she had a penis. The woman responded that she didn't want to have male genitalia because it seems uncomfortable, like having \"meat and a nut sack\" in her britches. The boyfriend got offended, called her sexist, and left.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if the author (the woman) is in the wrong here. The user thinks she is, but wants to know what others think. Let's break down the key points.\n\nThe boyfriend's initial comment was a bit dismissive of dealing with periods and made a joke implying that having a penis would be better. The woman's response was to express that she doesn't want male genitalia because they seem uncomfortable. She gives examples like the boyfriend scratching his nuts, which are actual observations. The boyfriend then gets upset, calls her sexist, and storms off.\n\nThe woman is defending her body's natural state and expressing her opinion. She's pointing out that the male anatomy has certain maintenance issues he might take for granted. The boyfriend's reaction seems to be about being defensive about his own anatomy and perhaps feeling that her comments are degrading to men or to his body. But is that valid?\n\nSexism is typically about prejudice or discrimination based on gender. In this case, the woman is making a personal preference about her own body. If she's saying that male genitalia are uncomfortable, that's a personal opinion, not a generalization about all men being inferior or better. However, the boyfriend might interpret it as him being a bad person or his anatomy being undesirable. But is that a valid interpretation?\n\nThe boyfriend's initial comment was a bit flippant about periods, which is a sensitive topic. The woman's response is addressing that by pointing out the other side of the gender's experiences. Maybe the boyfriend felt that by criticizing his anatomy, she's dismissing his valid issues (like dealing with body maintenance) but he was being dismissive of hers (periods) first.\n\nSo, is the woman sexist? Probably not. She's expressing her personal discomfort with male anatomy as her own body. But could there be a better way to phrase it? Maybe. The use of terms like \"meat and a nut sack\" is colloquial and might come across as crude, but it's a blunt way to express her feelings. The boyfriend's reaction seems over-the-top, as he's taking her personal opinion as an attack on his gender. However, the line between personal opinion and sexism can be thin here.\n\nThe key is whether her statement is a generalization that devalues men. She's not saying men are worse; she's saying she doesn't want their anatomy. So, maybe she's not in the wrong. The boyfriend, on the other hand, made a dismissive comment about periods first. His reaction might be more about defensiveness than actual sexism. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. Both parties might have misstepped. But based on the question, the user is asking if the woman is in the wrong. The boyfriend's initial comment was probably more problematic, but the woman's response was her right to express her feelings. So, the answer might be B (No, she's not in the wrong). Alternatively, some might say A because her comment could be seen as making the male anatomy undesirable, but I think it's more about personal preference rather than prejudice.\n"
