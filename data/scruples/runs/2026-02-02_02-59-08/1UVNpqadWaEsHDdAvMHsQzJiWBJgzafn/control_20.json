Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The scenario is about a conversation where the boyfriend comments on not having to deal with periods, then says something like \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" The author responds negatively, explaining they find male genitalia uncomfortable and awkward. The boyfriend gets upset, calls her sexist, and storms off.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the context. The boyfriend made a flippant comment about being glad he doesn't have to deal with periods, then implies that having a penis would be better. The author's response is based on her personal feelings about male anatomy being uncomfortable. She's pointing out the downsides they don't consider. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction is to take offense, calling her sexist. But the author isn't making a generalization about all men or their anatomy; she's expressing her own preference and observations. Saying she doesn't want a penis because of the discomfort isn't sexist\u2014it's a personal choice. The boyfriend's initial comment could be seen as dismissive of the challenges women face with periods, which are real and significant. \n\nSo the author is defending her right to have her own bodily preferences. The boyfriend's reaction might stem from defensiveness or misunderstanding. The key here is that the author isn't making a sexist statement; she's sharing her perspective. Therefore, the boyfriend's reaction seems unwarranted. \n\nI should check if there are any other factors. The boyfriend's comment about trashing vaginas and periods might have been the root of the problem. He's making a comparison that undervalues female anatomy, and the author is rightly pointing out the other side. \n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong. She's responding to a comment that's already biased, and her response is a valid expression of her own views. The boyfriend's offense is misplaced. So the answer should be B.\n"
