Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong. The situation involves a couple arguing about whether having a penis is desirable. The boyfriend made a comment about being glad he didn't have to deal with the author's period, then said something like \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" The author responds that she doesn't want a penis because it seems uncomfortable and awkward, mentioning things like having to deal with genital maintenance. The boyfriend gets offended, calls her sexist, and storms off. The author is confused because the boyfriend was criticizing vaginas and periods earlier.\n\nSo, I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's break it down. The initial comment from the boyfriend was a bit dismissive of periods and then made a jab about wanting a penis. The author's response is based on her personal feelings about male genitalia being uncomfortable. She's giving her honest opinion, which is that she doesn't find having a penis desirable for those reasons. The boyfriend takes it as sexist, which might be because he feels she's devaluing his body or his experience. But the author points out that the boyfriend was earlier making negative comments about female anatomy and menstruation. \n\nNow, considering the concept of sexism, it's about prejudice or discrimination based on gender. If the author is making a generalization about men's bodies being uncomfortable without considering individual differences, that could be seen as sexist. However, she's expressing her personal experience and observations. She's not making a broad negative statement about all men, just about the physical aspects of having male genitalia. On the other hand, the boyfriend's initial comments were also critical of female anatomy, which is also a form of sexism. \n\nThe key here is whether the author's statement is sexist. She's stating her personal preference and observations. She's not making a judgment about men as a group, but rather about the physical aspects she finds undesirable. The boyfriend's reaction might stem from feeling that her comment is a personal attack on his body, but she's just explaining her perspective. The fact that he was earlier making similar negative remarks about female anatomy adds context\u2014he might be inconsistent in his reactions.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author is expressing her genuine feelings. It's not necessarily wrong for her to have that perspective. The boyfriend's reaction might be hypersensitive, especially since he was the one who started the conversation with his own negative comments. So, the author isn't in the wrong for stating her opinion. The boyfriend's issue with her response, after making his own negative remarks, might be the real problem here. Therefore, the answer would be B\u2014not in the wrong.\n"
