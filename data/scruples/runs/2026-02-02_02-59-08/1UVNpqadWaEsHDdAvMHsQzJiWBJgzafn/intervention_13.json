Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the boyfriend making a comment about not having to deal with periods, and the author responds by saying she doesn't want a penis, which leads to an argument where the boyfriend feels offended and accuses her of sexism.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The boyfriend made a joke about being glad he doesn't have to deal with periods and commented that maybe she wishes she had a penis. The author's response is about the discomfort of male genitalia, which the boyfriend interprets as sexist. \n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate the situation. The boyfriend's initial comment could be seen as dismissive towards periods, which are a natural part of life and can be challenging. His joke might be trivializing her experience. The author then responds honestly about her preferences regarding anatomy, pointing out the practical discomforts she observes in him. She's not attacking his gender but expressing personal feelings. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction seems to be about feeling attacked, but the author isn't making a generalization about all men or their bodies. She's stating her own perspective. However, the term \"sexist\" might be a stretch here, as she's not devaluing men or their anatomy in a broad sense. But maybe there's a communication issue here. The author could have been more tactful, but she's responding to his earlier dismissive comment.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend's reaction to being called out for trashing vaginas and periods might be about him not wanting to acknowledge his own sexism. He storms off, which could indicate defensiveness rather than a healthy discussion. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong for expressing her feelings, especially after his initial comment. It's about mutual respect in the conversation. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't being sexist; she's sharing her personal experience. The boyfriend's reaction seems more about defensiveness than the content of her response. Therefore, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
