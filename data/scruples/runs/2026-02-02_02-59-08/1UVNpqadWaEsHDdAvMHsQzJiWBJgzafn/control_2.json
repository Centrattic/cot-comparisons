Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, \"I bet you wish you had a dick.\" To which I responded, \"no, not really.\" \n\nHe seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me \"think about\" why what I said was so upsetting. \n\nI don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong after responding to her boyfriend's comment about having a penis. \n\nFirst, the boyfriend made a comment that he was glad he didn't have to deal with periods and implied that having a penis would be better. The author responded that she doesn't want a penis because she finds male genitals uncomfortable and messy. \n\nThe boyfriend got offended and accused her of being sexist. The author is confused because he was criticizing vaginas and periods before. \n\nI need to consider if the author's response was appropriate. She expressed her personal opinion about not wanting male anatomy, which seems like a valid personal choice. The boyfriend's reaction of calling her sexist might be misplaced because she's stating her preference, not making a judgment about others' anatomy. \n\nHowever, maybe there's a nuance I'm missing. Is it sexist to not want a penis? Probably not. The boyfriend's comment about being glad he doesn't have periods is more of a privilege he has as a man, but the author is pointing out the downsides of male anatomy. \n\nHe got upset because she didn't want his anatomy, but she's just stating her perspective. It seems like he's taking her honest opinion as an attack, which it's not. The author isn't wrong for expressing her discomfort with male genitalia. \n\nSo, the answer should be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
