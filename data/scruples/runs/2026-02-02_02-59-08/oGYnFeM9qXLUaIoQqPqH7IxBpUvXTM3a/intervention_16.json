She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for not allowing his girlfriend to be friends with her coworker who called another coworker her \"boyfriend.\" Let me break down the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend and her coworker (let's call her Jane) have been friends for three years. The coworker, Sam, has been at the job for some time and only interacts with the girlfriend. The author was okay with that initially. Then, the girlfriend deleted messages, and the author found out through her Fitbit that she had messages from Jane referring to Sam as \"boyfriend.\" The author then told her he doesn't want her to be friends with Jane anymore because she doesn't respect their relationship.\n\nNow, the key points here: The author is cutting off the friendship based on a single instance where Jane called Sam her \"boyfriend.\" The girlfriend claims she ignored the message and moved on. The author is taking a strict stance against any such references, even if they're innocent or work-related. \n\nIs the author overreacting? Well, in relationships, trust is important. However, cutting off a friend for a single joke or a term that might be a work joke seems harsh. The girlfriend might not have encouraged the behavior, just let it slide. The author's approach is to end the friendship rather than address it with Jane. That could be seen as extreme. The friend might not realize the term was offensive and the girlfriend could have handled it directly. The author's action might be an overreaction, making him the asshole. But if the author is genuinely uncomfortable with any such terms, maybe he's justified. But in terms of relationship boundaries, it's his girlfriend's choice who she's friends with unless there's more to the story. The author's method of finding out through sneaky means (using Fitbit) might also contribute to the issue. He might not be entirely in the wrong, but his reaction is a bit extreme. Hmm.\n"
