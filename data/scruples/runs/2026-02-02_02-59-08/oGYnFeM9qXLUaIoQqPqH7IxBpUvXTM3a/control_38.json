She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author's girlfriend has a female coworker friend who called another coworker her \"boyfriend.\" The author found out through some deleted messages and her Fitbit, then told her he doesn't want her to be friends with that coworker anymore. \n\nFirst, the key points: The friend referred to Sam as the girlfriend's \"boyfriend.\" The author is upset about that and wants the friendship to end because he feels disrespected. The girlfriend says she ignored the message and moved on. The author's reasoning is that the friend doesn't respect him as the boyfriend and the relationship.\n\nNow, is the author justified? Well, the friend used a term that implies a romantic relationship between Sam and the girlfriend. That's clearly inappropriate, especially if the friend knows the girlfriend is in a committed relationship. The girlfriend might have a duty to address that with her friend. However, cutting off a friend over one joke or comment might be too harsh. The author is taking a very strong stance, ending the friendship without maybe considering if there's more context or if the friend was just being careless.\n\nAlso, the author's method of finding out the messages\u2014using the Fitbit\u2014might have been manipulative, even if the girlfriend was hiding things. The author is in a position where he's controlling the girlfriend's relationships based on a single incident. That could be seen as overreacting. On the other hand, the friend's comment is indeed inappropriate, and the author has the right to feel disrespected. However, cutting off the friendship entirely because of it might be too extreme. The girlfriend could address the issue with her friend without severing the entire relationship. The author's approach might be controlling and not giving the friend a chance to correct her behavior. \n\nSo, considering that, the author might be in the wrong for cutting off the friend without giving her a warning or letting the girlfriend handle it. The friend's comment was wrong, but the author's response might be too harsh. The answer is likely A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
