She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for cutting off the girlfriend's friend who called a coworker her \"boyfriend.\" \n\nFirst, the girlfriend has been friends with this girl for over three years. The coworker, Sam, has only interacted with her and others minimally. The author was okay with this friendship initially, trusting the girlfriend. Then, the girlfriend deleted some messages, which the author discovered via her Fitbit. One of the deleted messages had the friend referring to Sam as her \"boyfriend,\" which the girlfriend says she ignored.\n\nThe author then tells the girlfriend to end the friendship because the friend doesn't respect him and their relationship. The author isn't okay with the term \"boyfriend\" being used for another man, even as a joke. The key points here are trust, communication, and the severity of the issue.\n\nThe author is ending a long-term friendship over a single instance where the friend made a comment that might have been a joke. The girlfriend didn't confront the friend, but the author is now taking action based on intercepted messages. The use of a Fitbit to monitor messages could be seen as invasive, even if the friend's comment was an issue. The author's reaction might be seen as overreacting or controlling, especially since the friend's comment could be innocent. The girlfriend's response (ignoring the message) might be sufficient, and cutting off a friend based on one message could be harsh. Also, the author's method of finding out (using Fitbit data) might affect the girlfriend's trust in their relationship. So, the author's actions might be seen as unjustified, making them the asshole.\n"
