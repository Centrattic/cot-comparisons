She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again to make sure I understand it.\n\nThe author's girlfriend (gf) has a coworker friend who's been a friend for over three years. The coworker (Sam) is described as someone who doesn't talk to many people at work but does interact with the gf. The author was okay with this, trusting their girlfriend. Then, the author found out that the friend had called another male coworker (Sam) her \"boyfriend\" in a message. The author learned this because the gf had deleted messages, but the author saw the message via her Fitbit. The author then told the gf to stop being friends with her because the friend was disrespectful by using the term \"boyfriend.\" The author is asking if they're the asshole for doing this.\n\nFirst, let me break down the key points. The author discovered the message through the girlfriend's deleted messages. The friend called Sam her \"boyfriend,\" which the author finds offensive. The author is now cutting off the friendship because of that one comment. \n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. The main issues here are: the method of finding out about the message (using the Fitbit to see deleted messages), the reaction to the friend's comment, and the decision to end the friendship over it.\n\nThe author mentions they had previously discussed checking each other's phones. The girlfriend deleted messages, but the author saw them through her Fitbit. This seems like a privacy issue. Even if the author is in a relationship where they check each other's phones, the fact that they used a third-party device (Fitbit) to access deleted messages might be questionable. It's possible the girlfriend didn't know the Fitbit logs messages, so she might not have had the chance to delete them there. This could be seen as an invasion of privacy.\n\nNext, the friend called Sam \"boyfriend.\" The author is upset because they don't accept the concept of \"work husbands\" or similar terms. The friend's comment might have been a joke or just a casual term, but the author took it seriously. The girlfriend claims she ignored the message and moved on. The author is now cutting off the friendship because the friend didn't \"respect\" them. \n\nIs cutting off the friend over a single comment reasonable? It depends on the context. If the friend is otherwise a good and trustworthy person, and this was an isolated incident, ending the friendship might be excessive. However, if the author feels that the friend is being disrespectful to their relationship, they might feel it's justified. But the line between protecting the relationship and being overly controlling is thin here.\n\nThe author's approach seems harsh. The friend might not have intended to disrespect the author and the girlfriend. The term \"boyfriend\" could be used in a different context, not as an actual romantic label. The author is making a significant decision (cutting off the friendship) based on one message, without discussing it with the friend to clarify. \n\nAlso, the author is using a situation where they obtained the message through what might be considered sneaky means (using the Fitbit). This could indicate a lack of trust in the relationship, which might be the real issue here. The author's actions (checking phones, using the Fitbit) might contribute to the problem, even if the content of the message is an issue.\n\nIn terms of whether the author is in the wrong, they made a decision to end the friendship based on a single message obtained through a method the girlfriend might not have been aware of. The author is controlling the girlfriend's social life based on a possibly misinterpreted comment. This could be seen as overstepping and not allowing the girlfriend to manage her own friendships. The author should have discussed the issue with the girlfriend and the friend to address the concern rather than cutting off the friend outright.\n\nSo putting it all together: the author's method of finding out the message is questionable, and their reaction is harsh without proper context or discussion. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong.\n"
