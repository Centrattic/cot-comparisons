She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for cutting off their girlfriend's friend after the friend called another coworker \"her boyfriend.\" The situation involves some trust issues and deleted messages.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend has been friends with this coworker for three years. The author is okay with the coworker (Sam) waving at her and being a work friend, but now there's an issue with the friend jokingly referring to another coworker as \"boyfriend.\" The author found out through the Fitbit messages that this happened and then decided to end the friendship. \n\nThe main points to consider: Did the friend do something wrong by jokingly calling someone a boyfriend? Probably not, as work relationships can sometimes include playful nicknames. The girlfriend didn't act on the message and moved on, so maybe she didn't find it offensive. The author's reaction is to cut off the friend entirely because they made a joke. \n\nIs it reasonable to end a three-year friendship over a single joke, especially if the friend didn't realize it was an issue? The author didn't discuss this with the girlfriend first, maybe didn't consider if the friend was aware it was inappropriate. Also, the author's approach seems a bit controlling\u2014using the Fitbit to find out about deleted messages shows a lack of trust. \n\nThe girlfriend's actions of deleting messages might indicate she's hiding something, but the author used that to confront her instead of talking openly. Cutting off the friend without discussing with the girlfriend might be an overreaction. The author is making a unilateral decision based on a joke that might not have been intended as anything serious. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author should have talked to the girlfriend about their feelings and boundaries before deciding to end the friendship. Reacting so strongly to a minor issue might be seen as overstepping, especially if the friendship wasn't causing real harm. So, I think the author is in the wrong here.\n"
