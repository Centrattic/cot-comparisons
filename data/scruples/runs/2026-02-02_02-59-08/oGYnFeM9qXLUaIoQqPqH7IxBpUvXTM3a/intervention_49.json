She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for cutting off their girlfriend's friend because the friend called another co-worker her \"boyfriend.\" Hmm.\n\nFirst, the situation: The girlfriend has been friends with this coworker (let's call her Sarah) for three years. The author is okay with the friend because she's the only one the coworker (Sam) talks to, but now there's this incident where Sarah refers to Sam as her \"boyfriend.\" The author found out through Fitbit messages that Sarah called Sam the boyfriend, and the girlfriend didn't tell them. Now the author is cutting off Sarah because they think the friend doesn't respect the relationship.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is overreacting. The friend made a joke, the girlfriend didn't think it was a big deal, and the author is ending the friendship based on that. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that they don't accept \"work husbands\" and feel disrespected by the term. But is it reasonable to end a three-year friendship over a joke? Maybe the friend didn't mean any harm. The girlfriend might have handled it better by addressing the joke with Sarah, but the author is taking it a step further by cutting off the friend without giving her a chance to explain or apologize.\n\nAlso, the author used the Fitbit to monitor messages, which might indicate a lack of trust. Even if the girlfriend deleted messages, using the Fitbit to find out and then reacting this way could be seen as controlling. The author's jealousy might be overblown here. People often use terms like \"boyfriend\" or \"work husband\" jokingly, and it's not necessarily a sign of disrespect.\n\nOn the other hand, the author has the right to set boundaries in the relationship. If they're uncomfortable with such terms, they should communicate that. However, ending a friendship based on one joke seems harsh. The author could have talked to the friend first instead of cutting her off. The girlfriend's response was to ignore the message, which the author now uses as a reason to end the friendship. But maybe the friend didn't realize it was offensive. The author should consider whether their reaction is proportional to the situation.\n\nSo, weighing all that, the author might be overreacting. Ending a friendship isn't the best approach here. They should address the issue with both the friend and the girlfriend, not just cut off the friend. Therefore, the answer is likely that the author is in the wrong.\n"
