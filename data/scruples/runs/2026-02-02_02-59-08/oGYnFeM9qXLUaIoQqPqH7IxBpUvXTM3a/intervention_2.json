She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for cutting off his girlfriend's friend over calling someone else her \"boyfriend.\" \n\nFirst, the girlfriend has a close friend from work who has been a colleague for three years. The friend refers to another coworker, Sam, as her \"boyfriend.\" The author found out through the girlfriend's deleted messages and her Fitbit. The friend's comment was about Sam being late, using the term \"boyfriend\" jokingly. The girlfriend claims she ignored it, and the author believes the friend disrespected them by using that term.\n\nThe key points here are about boundaries in relationships. The author is upset because the friend's joke could be seen as crossing a line, even if it was innocent. But the author's reaction is to cut off the friend entirely. Is that a reasonable response?\n\nThe girlfriend's friend has been a part of her life for three years, and the author didn't have an issue before this incident. The friend might not have intended any harm, just a light-hearted joke. The author is taking this one instance and ending the friendship, which could be seen as overreacting. Trust is a big part here too\u2014maybe the author should have discussed the issue with the girlfriend first and addressed the specific behavior instead of the friendship itself.\n\nAlso, the author used the girlfriend's Fitbit to find out about deleted messages, which might indicate a lack of trust and potential privacy issues. That could contribute to the tension, but the main question is about the friend.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. Instead of cutting off the friend, the author should have talked to the girlfriend about his feelings and set boundaries together. Ending a long-term friendship over a single joke, even if it's hurtful, might be too harsh. The friend might not realize the term was offensive, and the couple could have addressed it directly.\n\nSo considering all that, the author's action seems extreme. While it's understandable to feel disrespected, the response of ending the friendship entirely might be unwarranted. Therefore, the author could be in the wrong.\n"
