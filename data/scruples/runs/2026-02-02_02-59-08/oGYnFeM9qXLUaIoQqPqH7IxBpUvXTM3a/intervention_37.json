She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the original post) is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's girlfriend (GF) and her friend (the co-worker's friend), who referred to a male coworker as her \"boyfriend\" in a message that the GF deleted. The author found out about the message and decided to end the friendship because of it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The GF has been friends with this person for over three years, and the author was okay with the coworker (Sam) being a friendly acquaintance. The author discovered the message through the GF's Fitbit, which retained the deleted messages longer than her phone. The GF claims that Sam is the only person in the workplace she interacts with, and he doesn't talk to others much. The friend's message was a joke, calling Sam the GF's boyfriend, but the GF didn't respond and moved on. The author, upon finding out, decided to end the friendship, arguing that the friend disrespected him and the relationship by making that reference.\n\nNow, the main question is whether the author's reaction is justified. The author's reasoning is that the friend's comment is inappropriate, even if it was a joke, and that the GF should have addressed it. The author is asserting that being called \"boyfriend\" to another man is not acceptable in their relationship, which values monogamy and clear boundaries. However, the friend didn't do anything beyond a joke, and the coworker (Sam) doesn't seem to be in a relationship with the GF. The GF's friend might just be using a term of familiarity, which is common in some workplaces as a form of inside joke or friendly teasing.\n\nThe author's action of cutting off the friendship seems extreme. Ending a long-term friendship over a single joke, even if it's hurtful, could be seen as overreacting. The GF's friend didn't engage in any behavior that would harm the relationship, like actual flirting or romantic involvement. The author might be projecting his own insecurities onto the situation, especially since he was previously okay with the GF's friendship with this person. The fact that the author found out through a deleted message (and used a Fitbit to uncover it) might also indicate a lack of trust, which could be a red flag in the relationship.\n\nAdditionally, the author's approach of ending the friendship without giving the GF a chance to address the issue directly with her friend might prevent a resolution. It's possible that discussing the matter with the friend could have clarified intentions and set boundaries without cutting off the friendship entirely. The author's decision to end the friendship unilaterally could be seen as controlling or not respecting the GF's autonomy in her social relationships.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's feelings are valid. If he's uncomfortable with the term \"boyfriend\" being used in the workplace for someone else, it's his right to express that. However, the line between expressing a concern and taking over the situation is important. The author could have discussed his feelings with the GF and let her handle the conversation with her friend, rather than making the decision to end the friendship himself.\n\nIn summary, while the author has legitimate concerns about how his relationship is perceived, his reaction of cutting off the friendship over a joke seems disproportionate. The friend didn't engage in any harmful behavior, and the author's approach might not respect the GF's long-standing relationship. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong here.\n"
