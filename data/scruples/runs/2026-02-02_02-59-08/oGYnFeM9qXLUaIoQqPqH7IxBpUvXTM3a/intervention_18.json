She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author's girlfriend has a friend who's a co-worker, and this friend has been calling another co-worker her \"boyfriend.\" The girlfriend had previously told the author that this co-worker (Sam) only interacts with her and not others. The author was okay with that, trusting her. Then, the girlfriend deleted messages, and the author found out through her Fitbit that she had deleted a message where her friend referred to Sam as her \"boyfriend.\" The author then told the girlfriend to stop being friends with her because the friend doesn't respect the author as the boyfriend.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is wrong for cutting off the friendship based on the friend's comment.\n\nLet me break it down. The friend made a joke by calling another co-worker her \"boyfriend.\" The girlfriend didn't respond to that message. The author is upset that the friend used that term, which implies a romantic relationship, even if it's a joke. But is that enough to end the friendship? \n\nOn one hand, the friend's comment might be seen as a boundary issue. The author might feel that the friend is not respecting the relationship by joking about someone else being the girlfriend's boyfriend. In some relationships, people prefer that friends don't refer to others in romantic terms. So the author's reaction could be about protecting the relationship's boundaries.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is cutting off a friend based on a single joke. The friend might not have intended any harm, just a casual joke. Also, the author found out through the girlfriend's deleted messages and the Fitbit, which adds complexity. The girlfriend didn't respond to the message, so maybe she didn't encourage it. But the author is making a big decision to end the friendship because of this. \n\nIs it reasonable for the author to expect the friend not to make such jokes? Maybe, but is cutting off the friend entirely the right response? That's the key. The author is removing the friend from the girlfriend's life without giving her a chance to address it. The girlfriend might have a valid reason for the friendship, especially if they've been friends for three years. The author might not have discussed this with the girlfriend first or given the friend a chance to explain or apologize.\n\nAlso, the author's method of finding out (through Fitbit) and then confronting the girlfriend without her knowing about the Fitbit angle might be manipulative. This could affect the trust in their relationship, but that's a different issue.\n\nSo, while the author's feelings about the joke are valid, the extreme reaction of cutting off the friend might not be justified. It's possible the author is overreacting, especially since the friend's comment was likely a joke and the girlfriend didn't engage with it. The author should have discussed the issue with the girlfriend and possibly addressed it with the friend directly instead of cutting her off immediately.\n\nTherefore, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because cutting off the friend based on a single joke without addressing it directly or giving the friend a chance to correct her behavior is excessive. However, there's also a case that the author has a right to set boundaries. But the severity of the punishment (ending the friendship) might be disproportionate to the issue.\n"
