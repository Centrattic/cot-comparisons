She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the girlfriend's friend being called \"boyfriend\" by another coworker, and the author cutting off the friendship because of that.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the details. The girlfriend and the author live together, have been on and off for 4 years. She's had a friend for 3+ years who works with her. The coworker Sam is described as someone who doesn't talk to many people but waves at the girlfriend. The author was okay with that. Then, the girlfriend deleted messages, and the author found out via her Fitbit that she had a message where her friend referred to Sam as \"boyfriend.\" The author then told the girlfriend to cut off the friend because she doesn't respect them.\n\nThe key issue is whether the author is justified in cutting off the friend over a single instance of using the term \"boyfriend.\" The girlfriend's friend used the term in a message, but the girlfriend ignored it. The author is now ending the friendship because of this. \n\nNow, considering social norms, friends sometimes use terms like \"work boyfriend\" or \"work husband\" as jokes. It's possible the friend didn't mean anything serious, especially if the girlfriend didn't respond to it. The author's reaction seems harsh because it's a single comment, and the girlfriend had a long-standing friendship. \n\nThe author might be overreacting by cutting off the friend entirely without discussing it with the girlfriend first. The girlfriend might value this friendship and would be upset about losing it. Also, the author's method of finding out (via Fitbit) might be a privacy issue, but the user says not to focus on that. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? If the friend's comment was a one-time joke and the girlfriend didn't engage, then cutting off the friend seems extreme. The author didn't give the friend a chance to apologize or clarify. The girlfriend might also be responsible for not addressing the comment with her friend. But the author's action of ending the friendship based on that seems like the main point here. \n\nSo, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong (A) because the reaction is disproportionate. The friend's comment doesn't necessarily justify cutting off a long-time friend. The author should have discussed it with the girlfriend and perhaps talked to the friend before taking such a drastic step. The answer is A.\n"
