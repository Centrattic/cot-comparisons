She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves the girlfriend's friend, Sam, who's a coworker. The author found out that the friend called another coworker Sam's \"boyfriend,\" which made him cut off the friendship.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The girlfriend and her friend have been friends for three years at work. The author was okay with the friend waving at his girlfriend before, but now he's upset because the friend used the term \"boyfriend\" for Sam. The author discovered this through a Fitbit message his girlfriend didn't delete. He then told her she shouldn't be friends with the coworker anymore because the friend doesn't respect him as a partner.\n\nHmm. The main issue here is whether the author's reaction is justified. Let's consider the dynamics. The term \"boyfriend\" here might be a casual term at work, like a \"work husband,\" which some people use as a joke or to denote a close relationship that's not romantic. The author is against such terms, thinking it's inappropriate. The girlfriend didn't address it with the friend, which the author sees as a problem.\n\nNow, the author is ending the friendship over this. Is that reasonable? Well, in a relationship, communication is key. If the author felt uncomfortable with the term, he should have discussed it with his girlfriend first, rather than cutting off her friend. Ending a friendship over a single instance of a term might be overreacting, especially if it's not a serious context. The friend might not have intended any harm, and the girlfriend might feel her friend is being unfairly punished.\n\nAlso, the author's method of discovering the message (using the Fitbit) could come into play. Even if he didn't hack her phone, the way he got the information might be questionable, though that's not the main issue here. The main issue is his response. Reacting by ending the friendship might be seen as controlling or not giving the friend a chance to explain or correct their behavior. The author should have perhaps addressed the friend directly or talked with his girlfriend about her boundaries first.\n\nAdditionally, the girlfriend's history of being on and off with the author for four years might affect their trust dynamics. But that's more background. The key is whether cutting off a friend over a single term is justified. The author's stance is about respect for the relationship, but the friend's action might not have been malicious. The author's approach seems harsh because it's ending a long-term friendship without giving the friend a chance to understand the author's perspective. \n\nSo putting it all together, the author's reaction might be seen as overreacting. The friend using the term \"boyfriend\" might not be a valid reason to end a friendship, especially without proper communication. The author could have handled it by discussing with his girlfriend and perhaps addressing the friend directly. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong.\n"
