She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is the asshole (AITA) for cutting off their girlfriend's friend because she called another coworker her \"boyfriend.\" The situation involves some trust issues and communication problems.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend and the author have been together for 3 months but were on-again, off-again for 4 years. They live together now. The friend in question has been a coworker for over three years, and the friend's male coworker, Sam, only interacts with the girlfriend. The author was okay with this initially because the girlfriend had mentioned that Sam doesn't talk to others much. \n\nThen, the girlfriend deletes messages, which the author discovers through her Fitbit. The deleted message was about Sam being called her \"boyfriend.\" The author confronts her, and she admits to ignoring the message. The author then tells her not to be friends with the coworker anymore because the friend doesn't respect their relationship.\n\nNow, the key points here: The author is cutting off the friend based on a single instance of a joke about a \"boyfriend.\" The friend might have been joking, which is common in workplaces. The girlfriend didn't engage with it and moved on. The author's reaction seems extreme\u2014ending the friendship over a joke that wasn't acted upon.\n\nThe author's trust issues might be valid if there were previous problems, but cutting off a friend over a single joke seems harsh. Also, using the Fitbit to find out about deleted messages might indicate a lack of trust. The girlfriend might feel her autonomy is being undermined. The friend might not have intended any harm, and the author's response could be seen as controlling.\n\nOn the other hand, the author feels disrespected by the joke and wants boundaries. However, the appropriate response would be to talk to the friend directly rather than cutting off the friendship. The author's method of confronting the girlfriend by cutting off the friend might not be fair, especially if the friend didn't realize the joke was inappropriate.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author's reaction might be over the top. They could be in the wrong for not giving the friend a chance to address the comment and for ending the friendship based on a single incident. Their approach might be more about control than a genuine issue with the friend's behavior. Therefore, the answer is A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
