She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author, a guy, is telling his girlfriend they can't be friends with a co-worker anymore because that co-worker called another guy her \"boyfriend.\" The girlfriend had a friend who's been working with her for three years, and the guy in question (Sam) only interacts with her. The girlfriend deleted some messages, but the author found out via her Fitbit that she had a message where the friend referred to Sam as her \"boyfriend.\" The author then cut off the friendship, saying the friend doesn't respect him or the couple.\n\nFirst, I need to break this down. The main issue is whether the author is overstepping by ending the friendship based on a single comment. The friend called Sam her \"boyfriend,\" which the author interprets as a lack of respect. But the girlfriend says Sam doesn't talk to anyone else at work and just waves. So maybe the friend is joking, as the author acknowledges people sometimes have \"work husbands.\" The author is strict about not allowing even joking references. \n\nThe girlfriend tried to delete messages but didn't know the Fitbit retained them. The author used that to pressure her into confessing. Now, the author is cutting off the friend. The question is if the author is in the wrong here.\n\nI think the key points are: 1) The author is controlling by monitoring the girlfriend's messages and using the Fitbit to find out what was deleted. 2) The friend's comment might be innocent or a joke, and cutting off a three-year friendship over a single term seems harsh. 3) The author is making the girlfriend choose between her friend and him, which could be manipulative. 4) Trust is a big issue here; the author is using the deleted messages as a way to exert control, which could damage the relationship.\n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong because he's overreacting to a potentially innocent situation, using surveillance tactics, and cutting off the friend without considering her feelings or the context. The friend might have been joking, and the author isn't allowing for that nuance. Additionally, the way he's handling the situation\u2014using the Fitbit as a tool to pressure the girlfriend\u2014seems controlling. Therefore, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
