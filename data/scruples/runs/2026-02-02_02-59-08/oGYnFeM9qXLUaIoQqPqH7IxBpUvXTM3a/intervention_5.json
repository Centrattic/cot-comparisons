She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the AITA post) is in the wrong for cutting off their girlfriend's friend because the friend called someone else \"boyfriend.\" \n\nFirst, the key points from the scenario: The girlfriend (GF) and the author are in a 4-year on-and-off relationship, now living together for 3 months. The GF has a friend (let's say \"Friend A\") who has been a coworker for 3+ years. The author was okay with the GF and Friend A being friends because he was told that Sam (another coworker) only interacts with the GF and waves at her. Then, the author finds out that Friend A called Sam \"her boyfriend\" in a message that the GF deleted. The author then cuts off Friend A because of this, claiming it's disrespectful to him and the relationship.\n\nNow, considering relationship boundaries and trust. The author's reaction is based on jealousy or insecurity, maybe. The friend's comment was likely a joke or casual, as the GF ignored it. The author uses the GF's deleted messages (found via Fitbit) to confront her, which might be manipulative or controlling. Even if the friend's comment was inappropriate, the author's response of cutting off Friend A entirely seems extreme. Relationships typically require communication and discussion before taking such drastic steps. The GF might have the right to have friends, and the friend might not have intended harm. The author's trust in the GF was shaken, but cutting off a long-time friend over a single joke is harsh. Also, the author's use of the Fitbit to track deleted messages indicates a lack of trust, which can be a red flag in a relationship. The author's approach may be more about asserting control rather than addressing the actual issue with the friend. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because their reaction is disproportionate and controlling.\n"
