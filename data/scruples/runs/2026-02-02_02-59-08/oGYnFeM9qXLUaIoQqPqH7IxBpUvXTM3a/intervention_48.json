She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a guy who's upset because his girlfriend's friend called another coworker her \"boyfriend.\" The guy then tells his girlfriend to stop being friends with that friend. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics. The girlfriend has worked with this friend for three years, and the friend has a reputation of being a bit of a loner, only talking to her. The author found out that the friend called someone else \"boyfriend,\" which he took as a slight, leading him to cut off the friendship. \n\nThe key points here are: The friend's comment was a joke, maybe, about a coworker being late. The author used the Fitbit messages to figure out what was deleted. He then confronted the girlfriend and ended the friendship. \n\nNow, does the author have the right to end the friendship because of one joke? The friend might not have realized it was offensive, especially in a workplace context where such terms are sometimes used humorously. The girlfriend might not have agreed with the friend's comment, but the author is taking it upon himself to cut off the friend without her consent. \n\nAlso, the author used a sneaky method to find out about the messages. Even though he didn't hack the phone, he used the Fitbit to infer deleted messages. That might be a breach of trust, but the main issue is his reaction. \n\nIs it fair for him to end the friendship over one instance? Relationships and friendships can be complex. If the friend didn't mean any harm, the author's reaction could be seen as overstepping. The girlfriend might want to handle the situation with the friend herself, like talking to her about the comment. \n\nThe author's actions might be controlling. He's making a decision for his girlfriend about her friendships without her consent. That could be seen as not respecting her autonomy. \n\nOn the other hand, if the friend's comment was disrespectful, he might feel it's his duty to protect his girlfriend. But the line is thin between protecting and controlling. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong for cutting off the friend unilaterally without discussing it with his girlfriend first. He should have talked to her about his feelings and let her decide how to handle the situation. Instead of ending the friendship, maybe addressing the comment directly with the friend would be better. \n\nTherefore, the answer is A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
