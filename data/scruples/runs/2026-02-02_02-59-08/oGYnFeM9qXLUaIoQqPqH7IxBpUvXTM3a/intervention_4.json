She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for cutting off his girlfriend's friend because that friend called another co-worker her \"boyfriend.\" The girlfriend had a history of deleting messages, and the author found out through her Fitbit.\n\nFirst, the key issue here is the author's reaction. The friend referred to Sam as the girlfriend's \"boyfriend,\" which the author sees as disrespectful. But the friend might just be making a joke or using a term that's common in a workplace. The girlfriend claims she ignored it and moved on, which is plausible. The author, however, doesn't seem to trust her judgment here and is using the deleted message as a reason to end the friendship.\n\nThe author's approach is pretty drastic. Ending a friendship because someone uses a nickname, even if it's a misnomer, might be overreacting. Also, using the Fitbit as a way to pressure the girlfriend to confess might be manipulative. The girlfriend had a history of on-and-off relationships with the author, which complicates trust issues further.\n\nThe author's main argument is about respect in the relationship. But cutting off a friend based on one joke, especially when the girlfriend herself didn't confront the friend, could be seen as controlling. The friend might not have intended harm, and the author's action might be more about his insecurities than the friend's actual behavior.\n\nAdditionally, the author seems to be using the deleted messages as leverage without considering the context. The girlfriend might have deleted the messages because she felt uncomfortable or wanted to avoid conflict, not necessarily to hide something. The author's method of finding out through the Fitbit also hints at a lack of trust, which can be a red flag in a relationship.\n\nSo, while the author's feelings are valid, his reaction is excessive and possibly controlling. The friend calling Sam a \"boyfriend\" isn't a major transgression, and ending the friendship isn't the appropriate response. The author should have discussed his feelings with his girlfriend and maybe addressed the behavior without cutting the friend out entirely.\n"
