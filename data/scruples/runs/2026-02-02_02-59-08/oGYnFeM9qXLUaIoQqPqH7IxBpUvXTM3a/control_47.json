She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe author is a guy whose girlfriend (28 years old) has a co-worker friend she's been friends with for over three years. The co-worker, Sam, doesn't talk to many people at work but has a friendly rapport with the girlfriend, waving and such. The author was okay with this initially. Now, the issue comes up when the friend calls another co-worker \"your boyfriend\" in a message. The author found out because the girlfriend deleted messages, and through her Fitbit, he saw the deleted message where the friend referred to Sam as her boyfriend. The author then told his girlfriend he doesn't want her to be friends with the friend anymore because she doesn't respect him or the couple. The main question is whether the author is in the wrong for cutting off the friendship over this.\n\nFirst, I should consider the dynamics here. The friend called another man \"boyfriend\" in a message to the girlfriend. The girlfriend claims she ignored it and moved on. The author is upset because he feels disrespected, even though the friend might have been joking or using a term that's common in some workplaces (like \"work husband\"). The author is taking a strong stance by ending the friendship, which could be seen as overreacting.\n\nBut then, there's also the context of the relationship. The couple has been on and off for four years and have been living together for three months. Also, they check each other's phones, which suggests there's some level of mistrust or jealousy already present. The girlfriend's deletion of messages might have triggered the author's suspicions, even though he found out through her Fitbit. The author is using this incident as a reason to cut off the friend, but is that justified?\n\nThe key points are whether the friend's comment was inappropriate and if the author's reaction is proportionate. The friend might have used \"boyfriend\" as a term of endearment or joke, common in workplaces where people don't have actual relationships. However, the author sees this as a lack of respect for their relationship. The girlfriend might not have addressed the friend's comment, which could be a failure on her part to set boundaries. But the author taking it upon himself to end the friendship could be seen as controlling or overstepping, especially if the friend's comment wasn't malicious.\n\nAlso, the method by which the author found out (using the Fitbit) might not be relevant to the moral question here, but it does show that there's underlying tension in the relationship. The author's trust issues, combined with the girlfriend's message deletion, might have led to his heightened reaction. However, cutting off a friend over a single joke or misstep, especially one that the girlfriend didn't take issue with, could be considered too harsh. The friend might not have intended harm, and the author's response could damage the girlfriend's trust and the friendship without a valid reason.\n\nSo, in summary, while the author has his reasons for feeling disrespected, the reaction of cutting off the friend entirely over a potentially innocent comment might be too extreme. The girlfriend may have a responsibility to address boundaries with her friend, but the author's unilateral decision to end the friendship could be seen as overreaching. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not allowing his girlfriend to be friends with the co-worker based on a single, possibly innocuous comment. The answer would lean towards \"A\" (author is in the wrong) because the reaction is disproportionate and controlling.\n"
