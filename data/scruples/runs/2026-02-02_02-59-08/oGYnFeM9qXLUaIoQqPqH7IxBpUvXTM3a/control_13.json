She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a girlfriend (gf) who has a friend at work, a female coworker, and another guy named Sam. The author (the guy) is upset because the friend referred to another coworker as her \"boyfriend.\" The author then tells his girlfriend he doesn't want her to be friends with that friend anymore.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author trusts his girlfriend because she told him that Sam doesn't talk to anyone else at work but waves at her. The friend called Sam \"her boyfriend,\" which is confusing because Sam is a guy? Wait, no, the friend is a female coworker who calls Sam \"her boyfriend.\" Wait, Sam is a guy, right? The user mentions \"girl\" as the friend, so maybe Sam is a guy. The friend is saying that Sam is her boyfriend. Wait, but the girlfriend's friend is a girl referring to Sam as her boyfriend, meaning Sam is the boyfriend of the friend?\n\nBut the girlfriend's name is mentioned as the one being friends with the coworker. Wait, the setup is that the girlfriend has a female coworker friend who has been her friend for 3+ years. The coworker (the friend) is the one who called Sam \"her boyfriend,\" where Sam is another coworker. So the friend is a female coworker who refers to Sam as \"her boyfriend,\" which would imply that Sam is her actual boyfriend or that they have a romantic relationship. But the girlfriend (gf) is the one in the relationship with the author.\n\nThe author is upset because his girlfriend's friend called Sam her boyfriend, even though the author believes that Sam doesn't talk to anyone else and only interacts with his girlfriend. The author then tells his girlfriend he doesn't want her to be friends with that coworker anymore because the friend doesn't respect him as the boyfriend and the relationship.\n\nThe author also mentions that the girlfriend deleted messages, but he found out through her Fitbit. The deleted message was from the friend calling Sam her boyfriend. The author then uses that as a reason to cut off the friendship.\n\nSo the main issue here is whether the author is in the wrong for cutting off the girlfriend's friend over the friend's comment about her own boyfriend. Wait, but Sam is the friend's boyfriend? Or is Sam just someone the friend interacts with?\n\nWait, the setup is that Sam is a coworker who doesn't talk to anyone except the author's girlfriend. The friend (the coworker) refers to Sam as her boyfriend. So the friend is saying that Sam is her boyfriend. But the girlfriend (gf) is the one who told the author that Sam doesn't talk to anyone else except her. So maybe the friend is in a relationship with Sam, but the author is jealous? Or maybe the friend is joking?\n\nThe author is upset because the friend called Sam her boyfriend, implying that the friend has a romantic relationship with Sam. The author is telling the girlfriend to stop being friends with that person because they don't respect him and the relationship. But the friend might just be using a term for a non-romantic relationship, like a work husband or something. The author isn't okay with either.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for cutting off the friend. The author's reasoning is that the friend's comment is disrespectful and implies a romantic relationship with Sam, which the author isn't okay with. However, the friend might not have any intention of being disrespectful, and the author is overreacting.\n\nAlso, the author found out about the message through the girlfriend's Fitbit, which she didn't know. So he used that as leverage to make her tell him what the messages were. Then, when he found out, he cut off the friendship. But the friend might not have done anything wrong, just using a term that's common in workplace contexts.\n\nIn terms of boundaries, it's about whether the author is justified in cutting off the friend because of a single comment. Also, is the author respecting his girlfriend's autonomy in her friendships? By cutting off the friend without the girlfriend's input or agreement, he's making a decision that affects her social life.\n\nThe girlfriend might feel that her friend is being called out for a joke or a term of endearment, not a serious relationship. The author's reaction could be seen as controlling or distrustful. The friend might not have intended any harm, and cutting off a long-term friendship over a single message could be excessive.\n\nAdditionally, the author's method of finding out the message (using the Fitbit) might have been sneaky, which could indicate a lack of trust and maybe overstepping. The girlfriend deleted the messages, but the author used a device to find out, which might have been a breach of privacy.\n\nSo putting it all together, the author is reacting to a situation where his girlfriend's friend made a comment, possibly in jest, about her own boyfriend (Sam). The author is cutting off the friendship because he feels disrespected, but the friend might not have intended that. The author's actions could be seen as controlling, especially if the girlfriend doesn't agree with the decision. The answer would likely be that the author is in the wrong because he's overreacting to a possibly innocent comment and cutting off the friend without considering her side or the girlfriend's wishes.\n"
