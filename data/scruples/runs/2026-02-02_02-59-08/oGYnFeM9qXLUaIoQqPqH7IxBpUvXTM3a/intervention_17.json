  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for not allowing my gf (28) to be friends with co-worker(of 3+ years) anymore for calling one of their co-workers her \"boyfriend\"?\nA little background, me and my gf live together (3 Months now) but have been on and off for 4 years. She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for cutting off his girlfriend's friend over a joke about calling another co-worker her \"boyfriend.\" \n\nFirst, the girlfriend has been friends with this coworker for three years. The coworker, Sam, only interacts with her at work, and the author was initially okay with that. Now, the friend made a joke referring to another guy as her \"boyfriend,\" which the author took as a lack of respect towards him and their relationship.\n\nThe author used the Fitbit to figure out that the girlfriend had deleted messages, leading to a confrontation. He then decided to end the friendship because of the friend's comment. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate.\n\nKey points to consider: Is it reasonable to end a friendship over a joke? The friend's comment was likely a joke, and the girlfriend didn't engage with it. The author's reaction might be overly harsh. Trust issues might be playing a role here, especially since the author is now controlling the girlfriend's actions based on a single message. Also, the author used the Fitbit to snoop, which might indicate a lack of trust from the start. Ending a three-year friendship due to a joke could be seen as disproportionate. The friend didn't show any malicious intent, just a joke. The author's decision might not consider the value of the friendship and the context of the situation. Therefore, the author's actions could be seen as too extreme, making him the asshole.\n"
