She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a boyfriend not wanting his girlfriend to be friends with a co-worker anymore because the friend called another guy his girlfriend's \"boyfriend.\" The girlfriend and her friend have been colleagues for over three years, and the boyfriend is upset about this. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author (the boyfriend) found out that his girlfriend's friend referred to another co-worker as her \"boyfriend.\" The girlfriend had deleted messages, but the author managed to read one through a Fitbit message. The author believes that calling someone else his girlfriend's \"boyfriend\" is disrespectful and a joke he isn't okay with. He then told her he doesn't want her to be friends with this person anymore.\n\nNow, I should consider the dynamics of their relationship. They've been on and off for four years but live together now. Trust is a factor here because the girlfriend mentioned that Sam (the co-worker) doesn't talk to anyone else, and she's been the one he interacts with. The author was okay with that initially, trusting her. \n\nThe main issue is whether the author is being unreasonable in cutting off the friendship. The friend called another man \"boyfriend,\" which the author sees as disrespectful. But is that really a valid reason? It's possible the friend was just making a joke or using a term of endearment, maybe not intending to mock or disrespect. The girlfriend tried to move past the message, which suggests it wasn't a big deal to her. \n\nAlso, the author used the Fitbit data to confront her about deleted messages. Even though the author claims not to hack her phone, the method he used to find out might make her feel betrayed. If the girlfriend had explained the situation, maybe the author would have understood. Instead, he's using this one instance to break the friendship, which might be a bit harsh. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author's reaction seems extreme. Instead of immediately cutting off the friend, perhaps discussing his feelings with the girlfriend and letting her address it with the friend would have been a better approach. The girlfriend might have a valid explanation, and the author's decision to end the friendship could be seen as controlling or overreacting. \n\nAdditionally, considering that the girlfriend and the friend have a long-standing relationship, the author's action could be viewed as not respecting her autonomy in choosing her friends. Unless there's a history of the friend being inappropriate, one comment might not justify ending the friendship. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's actions might be seen as the asshole because he's overreacting to a minor issue and not respecting his girlfriend's established friendship. The answer would be A (yes, he's in the wrong).\n"
