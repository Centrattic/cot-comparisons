She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for cutting off their girlfriend's friend because the friend called another coworker her \"boyfriend.\" \n\nFirst, the girlfriend has been friends with this coworker for over three years. The friend refers to another guy as the \"boyfriend,\" which the author takes as a disrespectful joke. The author found out through deleted messages and a Fitbit message. The girlfriend claims she ignored the message, but the author is still upset and wants the friendship to end.\n\nNow, the key points here. The friend's comment was a joke, probably not meant to be taken seriously, given the context of work relationships. The author's reaction seems extreme\u2014cutting off the friend entirely because of a single joke. The girlfriend might have handled it differently, but the author is imposing their own standards on a longstanding friendship. \n\nAlso, the author used the girlfriend's Fitbit to find out about the deleted messages. That's a privacy issue even if the Fitbit was slow to delete. The author's approach of using that to pressure the girlfriend into confessing might be manipulative. \n\nThe author is acting out of jealousy, but the situation doesn't seem to involve any real infidelity or serious boundary issues. The friend's comment was likely innocent. The author is overstepping by ending the friendship based on a joke. The girlfriend might need to set boundaries with her friend, but the author's solution is too harsh. \n\nSo, considering the context, the answer is probably A\u2014author is in the wrong. They're being controlling and not giving the friend a chance to acknowledge the mistake or apologize. Relationships require communication, but cutting off a friend over a joke isn't justified here.\n"
