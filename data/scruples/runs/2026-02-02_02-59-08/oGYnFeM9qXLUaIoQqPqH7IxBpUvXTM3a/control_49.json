She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for not allowing his girlfriend to continue being friends with her coworker who called another coworker her \"boyfriend.\" \n\nFirst, the situation: The girlfriend has been friends with this coworker for over three years. The author initially was okay with the friend because the coworker only interacted with her. But when the author found out that the friend referred to another coworker as her \"boyfriend,\" he decided to cut off the friendship. The key points here are about trust, boundaries, and communication.\n\nThe author discovered that the friend made a joke calling another guy the girlfriend's boyfriend. The girlfriend didn't object at the time, but the author is upset that the friend didn't respect the relationship. The author also mentions that the girlfriend deleted messages, which he found out via her Fitbit. He used that to confront her, and now he's cutting off her friend.\n\nNow, considering relationship dynamics. It's common for people to feel uncomfortable when their partner's friends make jokes about their relationships. However, cutting off a friend over a single joke might be extreme. The friend has a long-standing friendship, three years, which is a significant amount of time. The author's action is based on a single instance, even if it was a joke. Also, the author's method of finding out (using the Fitbit to read deleted messages) could be seen as invasive, even though he didn't hack her phone. The girlfriend might feel betrayed by his surveillance tactics.\n\nThe author's belief that the friend has no right to joke like that is valid, but cutting off the friendship entirely without discussing it with his girlfriend might be overreacting. It's possible the girlfriend wanted to handle the situation herself, especially since she didn't respond to the joke at the time. The author is making a decision that affects her social circle without her input, which could be seen as controlling.\n\nAdditionally, the fact that the author used the Fitbit as leverage to get her to confess messages might have damaged trust. Even if he didn't break into her phone, using her own device against her could be perceived as manipulative. \n\nIn terms of whether he's in the wrong, it depends on whose perspective you take. The author's actions stem from insecurity and a desire to protect the relationship, which is understandable. However, the method and the decision to cut off a long-time friend over a joke could be seen as overly controlling. Healthy communication is key in relationships, and instead of cutting off the friend, discussing boundaries with both his girlfriend and her friend might have been a better approach.\n\nSo, weighing these factors, the author's actions are problematic. He's overstepping by cutting off the friendship without addressing it with his girlfriend first and using surveillance tactics. While his feelings are valid, the way he handled it might make him the asshole.\n"
