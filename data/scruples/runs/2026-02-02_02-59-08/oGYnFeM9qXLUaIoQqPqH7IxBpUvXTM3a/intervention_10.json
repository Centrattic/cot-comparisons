She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for cutting off their girlfriend's friend because the friend called another coworker \"boyfriend.\" \n\nFirst, the girlfriend and the author have a history of checking each other's phones. The girlfriend deleted messages, but the author found out via her Fitbit. The friend mentioned a coworker as \"boyfriend,\" which the author took offense to.\n\nThe main issue here is whether the author overreacted by ending the friendship. The friend's comment was a joke, and the girlfriend had already addressed it by ignoring the message. The author didn't have a problem with the friend before this incident. Now, they're cutting off the friend solely based on one joke. \n\nI should consider if it's reasonable to end a long-term friendship over a minor, possibly innocent joke. The author might be acting out of jealousy or insecurity, especially since there's a history of checking phones. The friend didn't do anything malicious, just a playful remark. The girlfriend also claims the coworker doesn't talk to others, so the friend's joke might not indicate any real relationship.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might feel disrespected. But cutting off a friend without discussing it with the girlfriend first could be seen as controlling. The author's reaction seems extreme given the context. The girlfriend's friend might not have intended any harm, and the author's action could be based on a misunderstanding. \n\nSo, the answer is likely that the author is in the wrong for overreacting and not allowing the girlfriend to address the issue with her friend.\n"
