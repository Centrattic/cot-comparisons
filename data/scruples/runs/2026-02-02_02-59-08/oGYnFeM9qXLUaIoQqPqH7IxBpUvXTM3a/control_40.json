She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for cutting off his girlfriend's friend because the friend called another coworker her \"boyfriend.\" \n\nFirst, the girlfriend has been friends with this coworker for three years. The author was okay with the relationship initially, trusting her when she said the coworker (Sam) doesn't talk to anyone else much. Now, the issue is that the friend referred to another guy as the girlfriend's \"boyfriend,\" which the author finds disrespectful.\n\nThe girlfriend deleted messages, but the author found out through her Fitbit. The friend's message was a joke, and the girlfriend claims she ignored it. The author then tells her to cut off the friend because he feels disrespected.\n\nHmm, so the main question is whether the author is overreacting. The friend's comment might be seen as a joke or casual talk, but the author sees it as crossing a boundary. The girlfriend didn't act on it, just moved on. The author is enforcing a strict rule against any \"work husband\" terms, which might be too strict. Also, cutting off a three-year friend over a joke seems harsh. The author might be projecting his own jealousy or insecurity here. The girlfriend had the right to address it, but the author is taking control by ending the friendship without considering if the joke was serious. In relationships, communication is key, but cutting off someone else's friend without their input might be too extreme. So, the author is probably in the wrong because he's overreacting and not allowing his girlfriend to handle the situation herself.\n"
