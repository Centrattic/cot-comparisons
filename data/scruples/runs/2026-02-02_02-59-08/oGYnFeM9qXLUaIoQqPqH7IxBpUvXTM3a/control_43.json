She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The situation is about whether the author is in the wrong for cutting off his girlfriend's friend who called another coworker her \"boyfriend.\" \n\nFirst, I need to consider the details. The girlfriend has been friends with this coworker for three years. The coworker, Sam, is described as not talking to anyone much at work and only interacting with the girlfriend. The author was okay with that initially. Then, the girlfriend deleted messages, but the author found out through her Fitbit that there was a message where the friend referred to Sam as her \"boyfriend.\" The author then told the girlfriend he doesn't want her to be friends with this person anymore because the friend doesn't respect him or the relationship.\n\nHmm, so the main issue here is the friend calling someone else her \"boyfriend.\" The author is upset and wants the girlfriend to cut off contact because of this. Is that reasonable? Well, the friend's comment could be considered a joke or a work husband type of thing, which some people might find trivial. But the author isn't okay with either of those situations. \n\nThe girlfriend didn't respond to the message and moved on, according to her. She might not have been aware that the author would find out. The author's reaction is to cut off the friend entirely. That seems pretty harsh. The friend made a mistake in the message, but is that enough to end a three-year friendship over? Especially since the friend might not have realized the inappropriateness, or maybe thought it was a joke. \n\nAlso, the author's method of finding out\u2014using the Fitbit to track deleted messages\u2014could be seen as invasive. Even though the girlfriend might have been hiding things, the author's approach to handling it by cutting off the friend without discussing it properly might be problematic. The author is making a judgment based on a single message, which might not reflect the friend's true intentions or ongoing behavior.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is asserting his boundaries in the relationship, which is understandable. If he feels disrespected or that the friend is mocking the relationship, he might have a right to be upset. However, cutting off a friend entirely without giving them a chance to apologize or explain their actions might be excessive. The author could have communicated his concerns to the friend or the girlfriend about the message without necessarily ending the friendship.\n\nThe girlfriend's actions of deleting messages might indicate some level of secrecy or discomfort, but that's between her and the author. The friend's comment was a mistake, but the author's response seems overly harsh. The friend might have been unaware of the boundaries or thought it was a harmless joke. Ending a friendship over this without addressing it directly with the friend could be seen as the author not giving them a chance to correct their behavior.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author isn't entirely wrong for being upset, his reaction of cutting off the friend might be too extreme. The situation involves multiple layers: the friend's comment, the girlfriend's handling of it, and the author's method of addressing the issue. The author's approach could be seen as the asshole move because he's making a significant decision (ending a friendship) based on a single message, possibly without understanding the context. So, probably the answer is A (author is in the wrong), but I need to check if there's more to justify B.\n"
