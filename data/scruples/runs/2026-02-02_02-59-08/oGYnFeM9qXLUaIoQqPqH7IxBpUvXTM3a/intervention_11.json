She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for cutting off his girlfriend's friend because the friend called another coworker her \"boyfriend.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The girlfriend has been friends with this coworker for over three years. The coworker, Sam, is described as someone who doesn't talk to many people at work but does interact with the girlfriend. The author initially was okay with this friendship. Then, the girlfriend deleted messages, and through her Fitbit, the author found out that the friend referred to Sam as her \"boyfriend.\" The author then told his girlfriend to stop being friends with the coworker because the friend doesn't respect the relationship.\n\nSo, the main points here are: the author is upset about the friend calling Sam the boyfriend, leading him to cut off the friendship. The girlfriend didn't act on it, just moved the conversation on. The author is now cutting off the friend for joking, even if it's an innocent work husband situation.\n\nI need to consider if the author is overreacting. The term \"work husband\" is common in some workplaces as a joke. The friend might not have intended to offend anyone. The author's reaction seems extreme\u2014ending a three-year friendship over a single joke. Also, the girlfriend didn't take issue with it, so maybe the author is projecting his jealousy or insecurity here. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that the friend doesn't respect him as the boyfriend. But is that a valid reason? If the friend is just making a harmless joke, cutting off a long-time friend because of that might be too harsh. The author is assuming that the friend's comment is disrespectful, but it might not be intended that way. Additionally, the author is using the Fitbit trick to find out the deleted messages, which could indicate trust issues. \n\nAnother angle: the author is controlling communication by telling his girlfriend she can't see her friend anymore. That could be seen as an overstep. The girlfriend might have wanted to maintain the friendship, but the author is making the decision for her. \n\nSo, considering all that, I think the author is in the wrong. The situation is about a joke that might not have been meant to disrespect the relationship. Cutting off a friend for that is too extreme. The author's reaction stems from his own insecurities rather than the friend's actual intentions. The answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
