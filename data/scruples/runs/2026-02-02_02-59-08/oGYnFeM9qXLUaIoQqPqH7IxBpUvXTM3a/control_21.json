She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for cutting off their girlfriend's friend because the friend called a co-worker her \"boyfriend.\" \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The girlfriend and this friend have been friends for three years. The author is jealous because the friend referred to another co-worker as her \"boyfriend,\" which the author interprets as inappropriate. The girlfriend had previously mentioned that this co-worker, Sam, only interacts with her, so the author was okay with that. Now, after finding out about the message, the author is cutting off the friend.\n\nThe key points here are about boundaries in relationships. The author is making a big move\u2014cutting off a long-time friend\u2014based on a single message. The friend called another guy \"boyfriend,\" which the author sees as a breach of respect. But is that a valid reason? The girlfriend didn't respond to the message, and the friend might have just been joking around. The author is taking away the girlfriend's autonomy in deciding how to handle her friendships. \n\nAlso, the author is using the fact that the girlfriend deleted messages as a way to guilt-trip her. Even though the messages were mostly innocent, the author used the Fitbit to find out about the deleted message. The girlfriend might feel pressured to explain everything now, which could be a power imbalance in the relationship.\n\nThe question is whether cutting off a friend over a joke is reasonable. The author is enforcing a rule about not having \"work husbands\" or similar terms, but the friend didn't know the author's stance. The girlfriend might not have control over her friend's language, and cutting off the friend seems extreme. The author is not allowing the girlfriend to manage her own friendships, which could be seen as controlling.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might feel that the friend is disrespectful by using the term \"boyfriend\" for someone else. But the friend might not have meant anything by it. The author is taking a strict approach, but the situation might not warrant such a harsh reaction. The girlfriend's autonomy in her friendships is a big part of this. The author is making a decision for her, which could be seen as the problem here.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because cutting off a friend over a joke and not allowing the girlfriend to handle her own relationships is controlling behavior.\n"
