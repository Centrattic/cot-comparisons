She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the guy in the situation) is in the wrong for cutting off his girlfriend's friend because the friend called another coworker \"her boyfriend\" as a joke. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend has been a coworker for 3+ years, and the girlfriend has been friends with her for the same time. The guy was okay with the friendship initially because he trusted her. Then, there's the issue of the friend referring to Sam as the \"boyfriend.\" The guy found out through deleted messages (which he discovered via the Fitbit, not directly through her phone) that the friend made this comment. The girlfriend said she ignored the message and moved on, and the guy believes her.\n\nNow, the guy's response was to tell his girlfriend not to be friends with her anymore because the friend doesn't respect him and the relationship. The question is whether this reaction is justified or if he's in the wrong.\n\nFrom a relationship standpoint, trust and communication are key. The guy's main issue is about respect\u2014feeling that the friend's joke is a violation. However, the friend might not have intended it that way. The girlfriend didn't act on the comment and dismissed it, which the guy trusts her on. \n\nOn the other hand, cutting off a friend over a joke that the girlfriend didn't find problematic might be overreacting. The guy is making a judgment about the friend's intentions and the appropriateness of the joke without discussing it directly with the friend. He's also using surveillance (Fitbit) to monitor his girlfriend's communications, which could be a privacy issue. Even though he found out the messages through her Fitbit, which he didn't directly hack, the fact that he's using such methods might indicate a lack of trust from the start.\n\nMoreover, the friend's comment could be seen as a harmless work-related joke, especially since Sam doesn't interact much with others. The guy is enforcing a strict boundary that the girlfriend hasn't personally objected to. It's possible that the friend didn't realize the comment was an issue, and the girlfriend didn't address it, which complicates the situation.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the guy's reaction seems harsh. Ending the friendship based on a single joke, without addressing it with the friend first or understanding the context better, might be overstepping. The real issue here could be the guy's need for control and lack of trust, rather than the friend's comment itself. Therefore, he might be in the wrong.\n"
