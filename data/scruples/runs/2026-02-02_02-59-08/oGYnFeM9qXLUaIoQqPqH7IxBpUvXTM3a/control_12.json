She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for cutting off his girlfriend's friend because the friend called a co-worker her \"boyfriend.\" \n\nFirst, the situation: The girlfriend has been friends with this coworker for three years. The friend refers to a male coworker (Sam) as her boyfriend. The author found out through messages the girlfriend deleted, which he discovered via her Fitbit. He then told her he doesn't want her to be friends with the coworker anymore because the friend doesn't respect him as her partner and the couple.\n\nSo, the author's main issue is that the friend called someone else \"boyfriend,\" which he sees as disrespectful. He's enforcing a rule that his girlfriend should have told the friend it's not okay. He's cutting off the friendship because of this.\n\nNow, considering relationship boundaries. In some relationships, couples set boundaries about how others refer to people. If the author and his girlfriend had agreed that the friend shouldn't use the term \"boyfriend\" for someone else, then the friend might be overstepping. But the problem is whether the author is justified in cutting off the friend based on just this one comment.\n\nThe friend might have been joking, as the author acknowledges that sometimes people joke about work husbands or boyfriends. If the friend didn't intend any harm or if the girlfriend didn't take offense, maybe the author is overreacting. Also, the girlfriend didn't confront the friend about it, which the author is upset about. But maybe the friend's comment was innocent, and the author is making a big deal out of it.\n\nAnother angle: The author found out through deleted messages. The girlfriend might have deleted them because she didn't want to cause a conflict, not necessarily because she was hiding something. The author used her Fitbit to find out, which could be seen as invasive, but he admits he already knew about the deleted messages through her.\n\nIs cutting off a friend over a joke reasonable? If the girlfriend felt comfortable with the friend and the friend didn't mean any disrespect, the author might be being controlling. However, if the author feels that the term \"boyfriend\" is a red line, then maybe he's within his rights to ask the girlfriend to address it. But cutting off the friend entirely without discussing it with her might be too extreme, especially if the friend didn't know it was a problem.\n\nAlso, the author is enforcing this without considering the girlfriend's perspective. The friend might not have intended any disrespect, and the girlfriend might value the friendship more than the author realizes. The author's reaction could be seen as overstepping, especially if he's making a big deal out of a minor issue.\n\nIn terms of trust and communication, the author found out through sneaky means (Fitbit) and then decided unilaterally to cut off the friend. This could be seen as controlling or not trusting his girlfriend's judgment in the relationship. The girlfriend might feel that her autonomy in choosing friends is being restricted without proper discussion.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong because he's cutting off the friendship based on a potentially minor issue and without considering the girlfriend's views. The friend's comment could have been a joke, and the author is enforcing a boundary that the girlfriend didn't set. However, if the author feels that the term \"boyfriend\" is a deal-breaker, then maybe he's justified. But given the context, it's more likely that he's overreacting, making him the asshole. So answer A.\n"
