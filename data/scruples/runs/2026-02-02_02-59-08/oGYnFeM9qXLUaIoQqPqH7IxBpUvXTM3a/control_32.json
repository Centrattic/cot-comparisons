She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the girlfriend (gf) has a friend who's a coworker, Sam. The author (the guy) is upset because this friend called another coworker Sam's \"boyfriend.\" The author then tells the gf not to be friends with this friend anymore.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics between the author and the gf. They've been on and off for four years and are now living together. The author mentions that he doesn't trust the friend because she called another guy the friend's boyfriend. But the friend has been friends with the gf for three years, and the author was okay with the friend waving at the gf before.\n\nThe key points here are about trust and communication. The author found out about the message through the gf deleting messages and using her Fitbit. Even though he didn't hack her phone, he used her Fitbit data to find out what was deleted. The friend called someone \"boyfriend,\" which the author finds offensive. But is this a valid reason to cut off the friend?\n\nNow, is the author overreacting? If the friend made a joke that's not respectful towards the relationship, maybe the author has a right to be upset. However, cutting off the friend entirely because of one joke might be too extreme. The author could have addressed the issue by talking to the friend and setting boundaries instead of ending the friendship. Also, the author is using the fact that the friend called someone a \"boyfriend,\" but maybe the context was innocent. Without knowing the full story, cutting off the friend might not be fair.\n\nAdditionally, the author's method of finding out about the message (using the Fitbit) might indicate some level of mistrust or controlling behavior. If the author didn't know about the message but the friend was allowed to call the other guy a boyfriend, that's a problem, but cutting off the friend without discussing it might be a harsh reaction.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. Instead of cutting the friend, the author should have talked to the gf about his feelings and maybe discussed setting boundaries with the friend. By cutting off the friend, he's making a decision without considering the gf's perspective on the friendship and the context of the joke.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's reaction might be too extreme and not considering the broader context. Therefore, he might be in the wrong (Answer A). But if the joke was a clear violation of their relationship boundaries, then maybe not. However, the way he's handling it (cutting off the friend) without proper communication might make him the asshole.\n"
