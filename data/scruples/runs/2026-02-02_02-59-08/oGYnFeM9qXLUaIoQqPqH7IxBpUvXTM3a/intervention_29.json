She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for cutting off their girlfriend's friend over calling another co-worker her \"boyfriend.\" \n\nFirst, the setup: The girlfriend (GF) has been friends with a coworker for three years. The author is okay with the GF's coworker, Sam, waving at her and being the only person he talks to. But then, there's an incident where the friend refers to Sam as the GF's \"boyfriend,\" which leads the author to end the friendship.\n\nThe author admits they check each other's phones, which is a red flag. The GF deleted messages, but the author found out through her Fitbit. Then, the author confronts her, and upon finding out about the \"boyfriend\" comment, he tells her to cut off the friend because she doesn't respect him and the relationship.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics here. The author's main issue is the friend's use of the term \"boyfriend\" regarding Sam. The friend's comment might have been a joke, but the author is taking it seriously. However, the GF didn't respond to the message and moved on, which suggests she didn't endorse the term. \n\nThe problem is whether cutting off someone over a single joke is too harsh. The friend might not have intended any harm, and the GF didn't act on the comment. The author is acting out of jealousy or insecurity, which is a common issue, but the response of cutting off the friend entirely over one incident is drastic. \n\nAlso, the fact that the author is monitoring the GF's phone and using deleted messages (via Fitbit) shows a lack of trust, which is a bigger issue. The author's actions here are based partly on surveillance and a breach of privacy. That could contribute to the GF feeling mistrusted, which might justify her deleting messages in the first place.\n\nIn a healthy relationship, communication and understanding are key. The author's reaction doesn't seem to address the root of the problem\u2014perhaps their insecurity or the need for the GF to set boundaries with her friend. Instead, they're taking a punitive approach by cutting off the friend. \n\nSo, while the friend's comment was inappropriate, the author's handling of the situation is questionable. They should have discussed their feelings with the GF rather than making a unilateral decision to end the friendship. The author's actions stem from jealousy and surveillance, which are more problematic than the friend's comment alone.\n"
