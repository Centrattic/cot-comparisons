She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is the asshole (AITA) for cutting off their girlfriend's friend because the friend called another coworker \"her boyfriend.\" The girlfriend has been friends with this person for three years, and the author found out via a deleted message that the friend referred to Sam, a coworker, as \"boyfriend.\" The author then told the girlfriend to stop being friends with her because they don't respect the relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend and the author have been on and off for four years and are now living together. The girlfriend's friend, who has been a friend for three years, is the only person Sam interacts with at work. The author trusts the girlfriend initially but then uses her Fitbit data to find out about the deleted messages. The key issue is the friend calling Sam \"boyfriend,\" which the author finds unacceptable.\n\nThe author's main argument is that they don't want their girlfriend to be friends with someone who disrespects the couple. However, the friend's comment might be a joke or a casual term, common in some workplaces. The girlfriend didn't respond to the message and moved on, which suggests she didn't endorse the term. The author's reaction seems to be based on distrust, which was initially built on the girlfriend deleting messages. The author might be overreacting by cutting off the friend entirely over a single joke or miscommunication. \n\nAdditionally, the author's method of finding out (using Fitbit data) and lying about hacking her phone could erode trust. The girlfriend's friend may not have intended any harm, and cutting off a three-year friendship over this seems extreme. The author is making a judgment about the friend's respect for the relationship without considering the context of workplace dynamics. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. Instead of cutting off the friend, discussing boundaries with the girlfriend and addressing the issue with the friend might have been a better approach. The author's reaction might be more about their own insecurities or jealousy rather than the friend's actual behavior. Therefore, the author's action of ending the friendship seems disproportionate and possibly unfair to both the girlfriend and her friend.\n"
