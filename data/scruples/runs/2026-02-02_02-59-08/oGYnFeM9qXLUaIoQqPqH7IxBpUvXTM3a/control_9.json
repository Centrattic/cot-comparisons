She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for cutting off the girlfriend's friend who called another coworker her \"boyfriend.\" \n\nFirst, the situation: The girlfriend and the friend (let's say Alice) have been friends for three years. The girlfriend's coworker, Sam, has been interacting with her at work, but she's told the author (the questioner) that Sam doesn't talk to anyone else. The author was okay with this because he trusted her. Then, the girlfriend deleted messages from her phone, but the author found out by checking her Fitbit, which retains messages longer. One message was from Alice referring to Sam as the girlfriend's \"boyfriend.\" The author now wants the girlfriend to stop being friends with Alice because she made that comment.\n\nNow, the key points here. The author is upset that Alice called Sam the girlfriend's \"boyfriend,\" even though the girlfriend claims she ignored it. The author feels disrespected and cuts off Alice. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is making a decision about who the girlfriend can be friends with based on someone else's comment. That seems like a control issue. People sometimes have work relationships or jokes that are innocent, but the author is interpreting it as a slight against him. The girlfriend didn't report the comment, maybe because she thought it was harmless. The author's reaction is cutting off a long-time friend over a single joke, which might be overreacting.\n\nAlso, the author used the Fitbit to find out about the deleted messages, which might be a privacy invasion. Even though the girlfriend deleted the messages, the author is using her Fitbit data without her knowledge. That's a red flag for trust issues. The fact that the author is still accusing her of hiding things when she actually didn't know about the Fitbit data complicates things. \n\nAnother angle: The friend's comment might just be a joke, not a serious designation. The author is taking it as a personal slight, but maybe it's not intended that way. The girlfriend's reaction was to ignore it, which she might have thought was the right approach. The author is now punishing the friend for a joke, which might be harsh. \n\nIn relationships, it's important to communicate and set boundaries, but cutting off someone's friend because of a coworker's comment could be seen as overstepping. The author is making a decision that affects the girlfriend's personal life based on a situation that might not be as bad as he's interpreting it. \n\nOn the other hand, the author does have a right to feel disrespected if he believes the comment is inappropriate. However, the better approach might be to talk to the girlfriend about the comment and let her address it with the friend, rather than cutting the friend off unilaterally. \n\nSo, putting it all together: The author's reaction seems to stem from jealousy and lack of trust, possibly exacerbated by his own privacy invasion. Cutting off a long-time friend over a joke about a coworker is a strong move that might not be justified. The author is in the wrong for overreacting and controlling behavior.\n"
