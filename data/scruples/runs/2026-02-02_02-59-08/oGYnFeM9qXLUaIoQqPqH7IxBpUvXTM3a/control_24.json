She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for cutting off his girlfriend's friend because the friend called another coworker \"her boyfriend.\"\n\nFirst, the situation: The girlfriend has been friends with this coworker for three years. The coworker, Sam, is described as someone who doesn't talk to many people at work but interacts with the girlfriend. The author was okay with this initially but now found out that the friend referred to Sam as the girlfriend's \"boyfriend.\" The girlfriend deleted some messages, but the author found out via her Fitbit. He confronts her, and then tells her to stop being friends with the coworker because he feels disrespected.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics. The key points are:\n\n1. **Jealousy vs. Valid Concern**: The author is upset because someone else is being called the girlfriend's \"boyfriend.\" But the coworker isn't actually in a relationship with her. However, the friend's comment is a joke, which is common in workplaces. The author might be overreacting if the friend had no intention of being disrespectful.\n\n2. **Trust Issues**: The girlfriend and the author have a history of going through each other's phones. The author used the Fitbit to find deleted messages. This raises questions about trust and privacy. The author's reaction might stem from a lack of trust, which could be the root of the problem.\n\n3. **Communication**: The girlfriend didn't object to the friend's comment, thinking it was a joke. The author expects her to correct it, but maybe she didn't see it as an issue. The author is now cutting off the friend because of one joke, which might be excessive. It's possible that the author isn't addressing the underlying issues between him and his girlfriend, like the phone checking and lack of trust, instead focusing on the friend's comment.\n\n4. **Respect and Boundaries**: The friend's comment could be seen as dismissive or disrespectful, but it's a workplace joke. The author is taking a strong stance by cutting off the friend. Whether this is justified depends on the couple's values. However, ending a three-year friendship over one joke might be too harsh, especially if there's no prior issue.\n\n5. **Jealousy vs. Control**: The author is acting out of jealousy, which is normal, but cutting off a friend entirely is a drastic step. It might be a control issue if he's not allowing his girlfriend to have a friendship without interference. The girlfriend's privacy and autonomy are being invaded by the author's methods of checking her phone and Fitbit.\n\nConsidering these points, the author might be in the wrong because he's overreacting to a minor issue, using invasive methods to monitor his girlfriend, and cutting off a friend without addressing the root trust issues between them. The friend's comment, while potentially inappropriate, doesn't necessarily warrant ending a friendship. The author's actions seem more about controlling his girlfriend's social interactions rather than a legitimate concern for respect in the relationship.\n"
