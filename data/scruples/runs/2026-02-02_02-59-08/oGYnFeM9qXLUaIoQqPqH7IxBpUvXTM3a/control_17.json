She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for cutting off their girlfriend's friend because the friend called a male coworker her \"boyfriend.\" \n\nFirst, the girlfriend has been friends with this coworker for three years. The author was initially okay with the friendship because the coworker (Sam) doesn't talk to others much and just waves. Now, the friend called the coworker \"her boyfriend,\" which triggers the author to cut off the friend.\n\nThe key points here are about boundaries and trust. The author found out through the Fitbit messages that the friend made that comment. The girlfriend didn't mention it and deleted messages, which led the author to confront her. The author is now cutting off the friend because they feel disrespected.\n\nBut is that justified? The friend's comment was a joke, right? The girlfriend even said she ignored it. The author is taking a stance against any kind of \"work husband\" or joking terms, which are common in workplaces. By cutting off the friend, the author is taking a strong action based on a single joke. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend's actions\u2014deleting messages and hiding the conversation\u2014might indicate she's trying to manage the author's jealousy. However, the author is using that as leverage to cut off the friend. \n\nIs the author overreacting? Maybe. The friend's comment was probably harmless, and the author is not in a position to dictate the girlfriend's friendships unless there's a clear boundary issue. The original problem was the coworker's actions, but the friend made a joke. The author is punishing the friend instead of addressing the actual issue with the coworker.\n\nAdditionally, the author is using the Fitbit as evidence without the girlfriend's knowledge, which is sneaky. This might have eroded trust. The author's decision to cut off the friend based on a single joke, without the girlfriend addressing it herself, seems harsh. The girlfriend might have handled it on her own if it was a problem.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author should have discussed their discomfort with the coworker's attention instead of cutting off the friend. So, the author is in the wrong because they're overstepping by ending the friendship based on a joke and without proper communication.\n"
