She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is the asshole (AITA) for cutting off their girlfriend's friend over a joke. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the main issue is that the friend called another coworker the girlfriend's \"boyfriend,\" which the author took as a serious disrespect. The girlfriend had a three-year friendship with this friend, and the author is now cutting off the friend. \n\nSo, the author's reasoning: the friend made a joke by referring to another coworker as the \"boyfriend,\" and the author believes that such a joke isn't okay. The girlfriend didn't object to the joke, and the author found out through the Fitbit messages after the girlfriend deleted them. The author then tells the girlfriend they can't be friends with the friend anymore because the friend doesn't respect the relationship.\n\nFrom a relationship standpoint, trust is a big factor here. The author is concerned about the friend's actions and the girlfriend's response. However, the friend's comment seems to be a harmless joke, especially since the coworker is described as someone who doesn't interact much with others. The girlfriend didn't engage with the joke, which suggests she didn't take it seriously.\n\nThe author's reaction is cutting off the friend entirely. That's a big step. While it's understandable to feel disrespected, the friend's comment could be seen as a light-hearted joke rather than a malicious act. The author is making a decision based on a single instance, which might be overreacting. Also, the girlfriend didn't address the comment, which might mean she didn't see it as a problem. The author is imposing their own interpretation on the situation without discussing it with the friend first.\n\nAnother angle: the author used the Fitbit to find out about the deleted messages. This could indicate a lack of trust in the relationship, which might have contributed to the conflict. The girlfriend's deletion of messages might have been an attempt to avoid conflict, but the author's method of discovery could be seen as invasive.\n\nIn terms of whether the author is wrong, cutting off a friend over a joke could be seen as harsh. The friend's actions don't necessarily indicate disrespect for the relationship; it's more likely a casual joke. The author is making a judgment without addressing the friend directly. Relationships require communication, and the author's approach here skips that step, leading to a more severe consequence for the friend.\n\nTherefore, the author might be overreacting. The friend's comment, while possibly inconsiderate, doesn't warrant ending a three-year friendship unless there's a history of similar issues. The author's decision seems based on their own feelings of being disrespected without considering the context or giving the friend a chance to explain or apologize.\n"
