She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for cutting off their girlfriend's friend because she called another co-worker \"her boyfriend.\" The situation involves some trust issues and privacy concerns.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend had a friend (let's call her Jane) who's worked with her for three years. The author was okay with Jane being a friend, as they trusted their girlfriend. Then, the author found out that Jane referred to another co-worker, Sam, as her \"boyfriend.\" The author confronted the girlfriend and now wants her to cut off Jane because of that comment.\n\nThe key points here: The author used the girlfriend's Fitbit to read deleted messages, which she didn't know about. The friend's comment was a joke, but the author took it seriously. The girlfriend claims she ignored the message and moved on. The author is now cutting off the friendship because they feel disrespected.\n\nIs the author right to do this? Well, cutting off a friend over a single joke might be harsh. The friend might not have realized the author's sensitivity. Also, the author used surveillance (via Fitbit) to find out about the messages, which could be seen as an invasion of privacy. Even though the girlfriend was hiding messages, the author's method of uncovering them might be problematic. \n\nThe author's reaction seems extreme. Ending a three-year friendship based on one instance of a nickname might not be justified. The girlfriend had already addressed the comment by ignoring it, which could have been a better approach. The author's trust issues and lack of communication might be the real problem here. Instead of cutting off Jane, the author should have discussed their feelings with the girlfriend first to find a solution together.\n\nSo, while the friend's joke wasn't appropriate, the author's response might be overreacting. The use of hidden surveillance also complicates things. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong for cutting off the friend without considering the context and using questionable methods to uncover the messages.\n"
