She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a guy (the author) who's upset because his girlfriend's friend called another coworker her \"boyfriend.\" The girlfriend has been friends with this girl for three years, and the author is now cutting off the friendship. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author found out that the friend referred to a colleague as the girlfriend's \"boyfriend,\" which he didn't like. He used her Fitbit to find out she had deleted messages, which might be a privacy issue. Then, based on that incident, he told her to stop being friends with the girl because she doesn't respect him as a partner.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. \n\nThe friend's comment was a joke or a casual reference, which might not be intended to disrespect the author. The girlfriend might not have known the author would take it so seriously. The author's reaction is cutting off the friendship over a single comment, which could be seen as overreacting. Also, using her Fitbit to monitor messages could be a violation of privacy, even if she didn't know. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might feel that the friend's comment is inappropriate, especially since the friend isn't close to the couple. The author might believe that such references are disrespectful and undermine his relationship. However, the way he handled it\u2014cutting off the friendship without discussing it with his girlfriend or understanding her perspective\u2014could be problematic. \n\nThe girlfriend's actions, like deleting messages, might indicate some dishonesty, but that's a separate issue. The main question is whether cutting off the friend over a single joke is justified. Friends can have nicknames or jokes, and it might not be the friend's intention to disrespect the author. The author's trust in the relationship is important, but reacting by ending a long-term friendship might be excessive. \n\nAlso, the method he used to find out (using the Fitbit) could be a privacy invasion. Even if he's allowed to check her phone, using a third-party device's data might be an issue. However, the user's focus here is more on the justification of cutting off the friend, not the privacy aspect.\n\nIn terms of communication, the author didn't talk to the friend about the comment but instead decided to end the friendship. That's a big step without addressing the issue directly with the friend first. The friend might not have realized the comment was a problem. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author's reaction seems harsh. The friend's comment might be seen as a minor issue, especially if it's a joke. Ending a three-year friendship over this without proper discussion could be seen as the author overreacting. Therefore, he might be in the wrong. But if the author has a strong stance against such nicknames, maybe not. However, the context suggests that the friend didn't respect the author's relationship, but that's based on one comment. \n\nAnother angle: the girlfriend already knew the friend wasn't close to others, and she's the only one Sam interacts with. Maybe the friend's comment was an innocent mistake, and the author is projecting his own insecurities. The girlfriend's deletion of messages could indicate she's hiding something else, but the author's response is misdirected.\n\nOverall, the key factors are: the severity of the friend's comment, the author's method of finding out, and the disproportionate reaction. The answer might be that the author is in the wrong (A) because he's cutting off the friend without proper communication and overreacting to a minor issue. However, some might argue that he has the right to set boundaries in the relationship. But given the context, the reaction seems excessive. So I think the answer is A.\n"
