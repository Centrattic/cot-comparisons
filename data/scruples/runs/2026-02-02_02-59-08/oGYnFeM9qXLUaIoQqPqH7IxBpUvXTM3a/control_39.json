She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not allowing their girlfriend to be friends with a co-worker who called another co-worker her \"boyfriend.\" \n\nSo, the situation: The girlfriend has been friends with a girl for three years. The co-worker, Sam, only interacts with her and waves at her. The author was okay with that. Then, the girlfriend deleted messages, and through her Fitbit, the author found out that the friend called Sam her \"boyfriend.\" The author then told the girlfriend to stop being friends with her because the friend didn't respect them as a couple.\n\nHmm. First, I need to assess the dynamics here. The author's main issue is the friend referring to Sam as the \"boyfriend.\" The girlfriend had already told the author that Sam doesn't talk to anyone else at work and only interacts with her. The friend sent a message calling Sam the boyfriend, but the girlfriend claims she ignored it and moved on. \n\nThe author's reaction is to cut off the friendship. Now, the question is whether that's reasonable or if the author is in the wrong. \n\nOn one hand, the friend made a joke that could be seen as dismissive or not respecting the relationship. The author might feel that the friend is being flippant about relationships. On the other hand, the friend might not have intended any harm, maybe just using a term in a work context, like a \"work husband\" which is common in some workplaces. The girlfriend might be in a position where she's already in a sensitive situation with her partner, and the friend's comment was taken out of context.\n\nAlso, the author's approach is pretty harsh. Cutting off a three-year friendship over a single joke might be excessive. Even if the author is uncomfortable, maybe the better approach would be to talk to the friend directly about the issue rather than cutting off the girlfriend's friend. The girlfriend might feel that her friend was just making a joke and not intending to disrespect the relationship, especially if they have a history of such terms at work.\n\nAnother point: the author is using the girlfriend's deleted messages as evidence. The girlfriend might feel that the author is overstepping by monitoring her Fitbit or using that information to pressure her into ending the friendship. Trust is a big factor here. If the author is already checking her phone and using her Fitbit data, that could be a red flag in the relationship itself, which might contribute to the tension.\n\nAlso, the friend's comment was about Sam, not the author. The term \"boyfriend\" here might be a lighthearted way to refer to someone who's a close work colleague, especially if Sam only interacts with her. The author is taking it as a personal slight, which might not be justified if the context is purely work-related and the friend isn't involved in any romantic relationship with Sam.\n\nIn some workplaces, people use terms like \"work husband\" or \"work boyfriend\" as a way to show camaraderie without any romantic implications. The author might not be aware of that cultural context, leading to a misunderstanding. The girlfriend's response of ignoring the message and moving on suggests she didn't take it seriously, which might indicate that the friend's comment was indeed a joke without malice.\n\nSo, the author is acting on a perceived slight that might not be intended as such. Cutting off the friendship based on that could be seen as overreacting. The author's decision is based on a single message, and the approach is abrupt. The girlfriend might feel that her autonomy in choosing friends is being violated, especially if the friendship isn't harmful. \n\nTherefore, the author's actions seem to be an overreaction. They didn't give the friend a chance to clarify or apologize. The author is making a significant demand (ending the friendship) based on a minor issue that might not have been intended to cause harm. This could damage the girlfriend's trust and friendship network, which is a serious consequence for what might be a trivial joke in the workplace context.\n"
