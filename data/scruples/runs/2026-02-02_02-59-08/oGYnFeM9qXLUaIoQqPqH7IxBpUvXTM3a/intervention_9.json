  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for not allowing my gf (28) to be friends with co-worker(of 3+ years) anymore for calling one of their co-workers her \"boyfriend\"?\nA little background, me and my gf live together (3 Months now) but have been on and off for 4 years. She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person posting) is in the wrong for cutting off his girlfriend's friend because the friend called another coworker her \"boyfriend.\" The girlfriend has been friends with this coworker for over three years, and the author found out via deleted messages that the friend referred to another guy as her boyfriend.\n\nFirst, the author's main issue is the friend calling Sam, a male coworker, her boyfriend. The girlfriend claims she ignored the message and moved on. The author then decides the friend doesn't respect them as a couple and tells his girlfriend to cut off the friendship. \n\nNow, considering the context: the girlfriend had previously told the author that Sam doesn't talk to many people, and this friend is one of the few. The friend's comment might have been a joke, as the user mentions that people sometimes have \"work husband\" jokes. The author is strict about not allowing any other male references as boyfriend, which might be overreacting. \n\nThe author's method of finding out is through the girlfriend's deleted messages (via Fitbit), which the girlfriend isn't aware of. This suggests a lack of trust, which might have contributed to the situation. Also, the author didn't directly address the friend to clarify the joke, instead cutting off the friendship immediately. \n\nThe key points here are trust, communication, and boundaries. The author's reaction seems harsh because a single joke might not justify ending a friendship. The girlfriend might feel that the author is overstepping, especially since the friend's comment could be innocent. The author's approach of cutting off the friend without discussing it with the friend first could be seen as abrupt and disrespectful. \n\nAdditionally, the fact that the author used the girlfriend's Fitbit to find out about the messages shows a lack of transparency and trust, which is a red flag in relationships. Even if the girlfriend did delete messages, using such a method to find out what was said might not be the healthiest approach. \n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, the author is making a judgment based on a single instance of a potentially innocuous joke. The friend might not have intended any disrespect, and the author didn't give her a chance to explain. The girlfriend might have handled it by addressing the friend directly, but the author took it upon himself to end the friendship. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author's actions seem excessive and based on a lack of trust and communication. Therefore, the answer is likely that the author is in the wrong.\n"
