She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for cutting off their girlfriend's friend because the friend called someone else her \"boyfriend.\" \n\nFirst, there's the context of the relationship. They're already in a complicated on-and-off again relationship for four years, living together for three months. The girlfriend has been friends with this co-worker, Sam, for three years. The author was okay with her being friends with Sam because the girlfriend said Sam doesn't talk to anyone else at work. But then there's the issue of the friend referring to another guy as her \"boyfriend,\" which the author found out through deleted messages via the Fitbit.\n\nThe author's main issue is that the friend made a joke or a comment about Sam being the girlfriend's boyfriend. The author doesn't accept \"work husband\" jokes and believes the friend disrespected them. So he cuts off the friendship. The key points here are the trust issues, the history of the relationship, and the author's reaction.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics: the author is using the deleted messages as a reason to control the girlfriend's friendships. Even though they go through each other's phones, the author is leveraging the Fitbit as a tool to check messages, which might indicate some level of mistrust. The girlfriend might have deleted the messages because she felt it was a sensitive topic, but the author's response is to cut off the friend entirely. \n\nIs this a reasonable reaction? The friend's comment was a joke or a casual reference, not an actual romantic relationship. The author's reaction seems extreme because it's a common workplace dynamic where people might refer to others playfully. The friend didn't do anything wrong by calling someone a \"boyfriend\" if it's mutual and consensual. The author is imposing his own boundaries on the friend, which isn't the friend's responsibility. The girlfriend's friend's actions don't necessarily disrespect the author; it's more about a playful or mistaken term. \n\nAlso, the author is using the Fitbit as evidence, which might be a stretch. The girlfriend might not have known her Fitbit was keeping messages, so she thought she was being careful by deleting texts. The author is in a position where he's using technical details to justify cutting off a friend, which could be seen as controlling or overreacting. \n\nIn relationships, it's important to communicate boundaries, but cutting off a friend over a joke seems harsh. The author could have asked the girlfriend to address the friend's comment instead of cutting ties. The friend didn't directly act against the couple's relationship. The author's actions might be more about his own insecurity or trust issues rather than the friend's actual behavior. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's reaction is disproportionate. The friend's comment, while maybe not appropriate in the couple's eyes, doesn't warrant ending a friendship. The author is taking control of a situation that's not the friend's fault, which could be considered inconsiderate. Therefore, the answer leans towards the author being in the wrong.\n"
