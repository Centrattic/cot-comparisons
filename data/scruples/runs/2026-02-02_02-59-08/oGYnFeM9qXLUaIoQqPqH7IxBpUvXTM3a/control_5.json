She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a girlfriend and her friend at work. The friend called another coworker her \"boyfriend,\" and the author is upset and wants the girlfriend to stop being friends with her. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The girlfriend has been friends with this coworker for three years. The author was okay with them just waving and being friendly. The issue arises when the friend refers to another guy as her \"boyfriend,\" even if it's a joke. The author found out via deleted messages (using the Fitbit) and then told his girlfriend to cut off the friendship.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics here. The author's main issue is that the friend doesn't respect him as the boyfriend by using the term \"boyfriend\" for someone else. But the friend in question is a coworker who doesn't interact much with others. The girlfriend said that the coworker (Sam) doesn't really talk to anyone else and only waves at her. So maybe the friend was joking, but the author is taking it seriously.\n\nIs it the author's right to dictate who his girlfriend can be friends with? In relationships, boundaries are important, but cutting off a friend over a joke might be overreacting. The friend's message was a joke, and the girlfriend didn't engage with it. The author is making a big deal out of the term used, even though the friend might not have meant anything by it. \n\nAlso, the author admitted to checking her phone via Fitbit messages, which could be an invasion of privacy. Even if he found out through her deleting messages, his method of checking might be problematic. The girlfriend thought he hacked her phone, which shows some trust issues.\n\nSo, the author is acting out of jealousy or insecurity. He's deciding that the friendship should end based on a joke, not on any real harm. The friend didn't do anything malicious. The girlfriend tried to move past it, but the author isn't letting it go. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? It seems like he's being controlling. The friend's comment, while maybe not appropriate, doesn't justify ending the friendship. The author should talk to his girlfriend and express his feelings, but cutting off her friend over a joke is harsh. Therefore, the answer would be A, yes, the author is in the wrong.\n"
