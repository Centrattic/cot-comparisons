She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves the girlfriend (gf) and her friend who called another co-worker her \"boyfriend\" in a message. The author (the guy) found out through the Fitbit messages and decided to cut off the friendship because he felt disrespected.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The girlfriend had a friend (let's call her Friend A) who referred to another co-worker, Sam, as her \"boyfriend.\" The author found out that the friend made this comment, and he's upset because he doesn't want his girlfriend being friends with someone who doesn't respect their relationship. The girlfriend had previously told him that Sam doesn't talk to anyone at work except her, and the author was okay with that. Now, after finding out about the message, he's cutting off Friend A.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. \n\n1. **Friend A's Joke**: Calling someone a \"boyfriend\" in a work context might be a joke, but it could be seen as crossing a line if the friend is in a relationship. However, the friend might not have intended any harm. The context is important here. If Sam is known to only interact with the girlfriend, maybe others might think there's something going on, even if there isn't. But Friend A's comment could be a harmless joke among colleagues.\n\n2. **The Author's Reaction**: The author didn't confront the friend directly but decided to cut off the friendship entirely. That's a significant step. Is it justified? Well, the author feels disrespected, which is understandable. However, cutting off a long-term friend over a single joke might be an overreaction. Especially since the girlfriend had already addressed the issue by ignoring the message. The author's decision to end the friendship might be based on a lack of trust or overreaction to a minor incident.\n\n3. **Communication Issues**: The author used a sneaky method (Fitbit) to find out what the girlfriend had deleted. This could have led to a breach of trust. Even though the girlfriend had deleted messages, the way the author found out might have contributed to the situation. The girlfriend might have felt violated, which could affect their relationship dynamics.\n\n4. **Right to Friendship**: The girlfriend has a right to maintain friendships unless they're harmful. The friend's comment might not have been malicious. The author's decision to end the friendship without discussing it with the friend or the girlfriend could be seen as controlling. It's important to consider whether the friendship is actually a problem or if it's the author's insecurities causing the issue.\n\n5. **Trust and Control**: The author's actions might stem from jealousy or lack of trust. If the girlfriend had already explained that she was just friends with Sam, the author's continued suspicion could be an issue. Cutting off the friend without giving her a chance to apologize or explain might be an overreach.\n\nPutting it all together, the author's reaction might be an overreaction. While it's understandable to feel upset about being called a \"boyfriend\" in a joke, ending the friendship entirely without direct communication seems harsh. The method of finding out the message (using Fitbit) might have also contributed to mistrust. The girlfriend might have wanted to handle the situation herself, but the author took it upon himself, which could be seen as controlling. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong.\n"
