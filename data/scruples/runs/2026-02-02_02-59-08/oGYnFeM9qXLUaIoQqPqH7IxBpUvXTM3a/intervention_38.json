She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by breaking down the situation. The author is a guy in a relationship with his girlfriend, and he's upset because she's friends with a coworker who called another coworker \"her boyfriend.\" The author cut off the friendship because of this.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend has been friends with this coworker for three years. The author was okay with their interactions before because the coworker (Sam) doesn't talk to anyone else at work, just waves at his girlfriend. Then a message comes up where the coworker refers to Sam as \"her boyfriend,\" which the author finds problematic. He used the fact that his girlfriend deleted messages to confront her, found out about the \"boyfriend\" comment, and then told her he doesn't want her to be friends with the coworker anymore. He's asking if he's the asshole for doing that.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about boundaries and trust. The author is upset because the coworker called someone else \"his girlfriend's boyfriend,\" which he sees as disrespectful. But is it fair to end the friendship over that? Also, the author used her Fitbit to find out about the deleted messages, which might be a breach of trust, though maybe not the main focus here.\n\nThe girlfriend's friend might have been joking or using a term casually, like a \"work husband,\" which some people do in workplaces. The author, however, is adamant that he doesn't want his girlfriend to have any such nicknames for others. His reaction is to cut off the friendship entirely. Is that a reasonable response?\n\nCommunication is important. If the author felt uncomfortable with the term, maybe he should have talked to his girlfriend and asked her to address it with her friend. Instead, he cut off the friend without giving her a chance to resolve it. That seems harsh. Also, the girlfriend might have felt that the nickname was innocent, and the author's reaction could be seen as overstepping, especially since the friend didn't know he existed yet, perhaps.\n\nAnother angle: the author found out through snooping (using her Fitbit) that she deleted messages. That shows a lack of trust, which might contribute to the problem. The girlfriend might feel that the author is being controlling and not respecting her friendships. Even if the nickname was a problem, ending the friendship without discussing it first seems extreme.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's actions might be seen as overreacting. The friend used a term that could be considered a joke or casual, and the author's response of cutting off the friendship entirely could be seen as being inconsiderate of his girlfriend's feelings and her established relationship with her coworker. Also, using the Fitbit to find out about the messages suggests a lack of open communication and trust, which could be part of the issue.\n\nTherefore, the author might be in the wrong for cutting off the friendship without giving his girlfriend a chance to handle the situation and for overreacting to a potentially innocent comment. So the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
