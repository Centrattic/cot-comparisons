She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for cutting off their girlfriend's friend after the friend called a coworker her \"boyfriend.\" \n\nFirst, the girlfriend and her friend have known each other for three years. The friend, Sam, is a coworker who doesn't interact much with others but does wave at the girlfriend. The author was okay with this initially. Now, the friend referred to another coworker as the girlfriend's \"boyfriend,\" which the girlfriend didn't address. The author found out through Fitbit messages that were deleted but still visible, leading him to confront the girlfriend. He then told her he doesn't want her to be friends with this coworker anymore because they don't respect him or the relationship.\n\nThe key points here: The friend's comment was a joke, maybe an innocent \"work husband\" scenario. The girlfriend didn't explicitly say it's not okay, but she moved on from the conversation. The author is taking it as a personal disrespect and cutting off the friend. \n\nIs the author overreacting? Well, in relationships, trust is important. But cutting off someone just because they made a joke could be harsh. The friend didn't do anything wrong on purpose. The girlfriend didn't confront the friend about the comment, which might mean she didn't mind. The author's reaction seems controlling, especially since he's using a deleted message (even if seen via Fitbit) to justify breaking the friendship. \n\nAlso, the author was okay with the friend before, so this seems like a sudden change. The fact that he's using the Fitbit to find deleted texts might indicate a lack of trust. Even if the friend's comment was a joke, the author's response is cutting off the friend entirely, which is a big step. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author's actions could be seen as the problem. He's making a judgment based on a joke that might not have been intended to harm the relationship. Instead of talking to the friend or addressing the issue with the girlfriend, he's taking a drastic measure. So, the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
