She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a girlfriend who has a friend at work, a female coworker. The author (the boyfriend) found out that this coworker referred to another guy as her \"boyfriend,\" which he took as a joke or a misstep, and he's now cutting off the friendship.\n\nFirst, let's break down the key points. The girlfriend and the coworker have been friends for over three years. The coworker, Sam, doesn't talk to many people at work but waves to the girlfriend. The author was okay with that initially. Then, the girlfriend deleted messages, but the author found out via her Fitbit that she had messages where the coworker referred to another guy as her \"boyfriend.\" The author is upset and is cutting off the friendship because he feels disrespected.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics: The author is acting based on a message where a coworker called someone else her \"boyfriend.\" But the girlfriend says she ignored it and moved on. The author is using this as a reason to end the friendship. The question is whether this is justified.\n\nFrom the boyfriend's perspective, he might feel that the friend is being disrespectful by making such a joke, especially about another man. However, the friend didn't actually do anything wrong in terms of her behavior towards the couple. The friend is simply making a joke with another coworker, not the girlfriend. The girlfriend didn't act on it, and it's a workplace relationship, which can have its own nuances.\n\nThe author is cutting off the friend because of a joke that wasn't directed at him. The girlfriend's friend might not be aware of the boyfriend's feelings, or it's just a light-hearted comment. The author's reaction seems a bit extreme\u2014ending the friendship based on one message. Also, the author is using the girlfriend's deletion of messages as leverage, which might not be the healthiest approach. The girlfriend might feel that her social life is being policed, especially since she's been friends with this person for years.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is expressing his boundaries and feelings. He might not be comfortable with the term \"boyfriend\" being used in a professional setting, which could be a valid concern. However, whether cutting off the friendship is the right response is debatable. The friend didn't do anything to harm the relationship, and the girlfriend didn't engage with the joke. The author's reaction might be more about control over his partner's social interactions than the actual incident.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author should discuss his feelings with his girlfriend and perhaps talk to the friend to express his discomfort if it's a recurring issue. Ending the friendship abruptly without addressing it with the friend could be seen as overreacting. The author might be in the wrong because he's punishing the friend for a one-time joke that wasn't directed at him and didn't involve the girlfriend in a harmful way. The girlfriend should have the autonomy to maintain her friendships unless there's a valid reason to cut them off, which in this case seems lacking.\n"
