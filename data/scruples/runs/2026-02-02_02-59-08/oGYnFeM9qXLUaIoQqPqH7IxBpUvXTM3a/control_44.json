She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a guy who's upset that his girlfriend's friend called another coworker her \"boyfriend.\" The guy doesn't want his girlfriend to be friends with that friend anymore. \n\nFirst, the girlfriend and this friend have been friends for three years. The friend (Sam) is a co-worker who only interacts with the girlfriend. The guy was okay with that initially because he trusted her. Then, the girlfriend deleted messages, but the guy found out through her Fitbit. The key message was when the friend referred to Sam as her \"boyfriend,\" which made the guy cut off the friendship.\n\nHmm, so the main issue here is whether the guy is justified in cutting off the friend. The friend made a joke by calling someone else the girlfriend's boyfriend. The girlfriend didn't respond to that message, so she didn't engage. The guy is taking it as a lack of respect and is cutting the friend off.\n\nNow, is the guy in the wrong? Well, the friend's comment might have been a joke or a casual term, which is common in workplaces. The girlfriend didn't act on it, so maybe she just ignored it. The guy's reaction seems pretty harsh\u2014ending the friendship over a joke that wasn't acted upon. Also, he's using the Fitbit data to find out what she deleted, which might be an invasion of privacy. Even if he's upset, cutting off a friend over a one-time joke might be extreme. The girlfriend might feel that her friend was just being playful and not intentionally disrespectful. \n\nOn the other hand, the guy has feelings about being respected. But the friend didn't directly address him or the girlfriend in a way that was malicious. The girlfriend's friend might not realize how it came across. The guy could have addressed the issue with the friend or talked to his girlfriend about his discomfort without cutting off the friendship entirely. \n\nSo considering all that, the guy's reaction seems a bit over the top. He's breaking up a three-year friendship over a joke that wasn't reciprocated. The friend didn't show disrespect in a serious way. Therefore, the guy might be the one acting like an asshole here by not giving the friend a chance to clarify or apologize. The answer is likely A, meaning the author is in the wrong.\n"
