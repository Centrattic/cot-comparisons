She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a girlfriend and her friend who called another co-worker \"boyfriend\" in a message. The guy (author) found out through some Fitbit tracking and told his girlfriend to cut off the friend because the friend doesn't respect them. He's asking if he's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The girlfriend and the co-worker (Sam) have a work relationship. The friend made a joke referring to Sam as the boyfriend. The author found out through the Fitbit that messages were deleted, leading him to confront the situation. He then told his girlfriend to stop being friends because of the joke.\n\nNow, considering relationships, trust, and boundaries. The girlfriend had been friends with this person for three years. The friend's comment might be a joke, but the author is taking it seriously and wants the friendship cut off. Is that a reasonable response?\n\nThe girlfriend didn't tell the author about the joke when he asked, but he used the Fitbit to find out. That raises questions about privacy and trust. The author's approach might be seen as controlling if he's cutting off a long-term friend over a single joke. However, the girlfriend might also have a responsibility to communicate boundaries to her friend.\n\nThe key issue is whether cutting off the friend is too harsh. If the joke was clearly meant to be a joke, maybe the author is overreacting. On the other hand, if the friend repeated the joke despite being told not to, that's different. Here, the friend made a comment, the girlfriend didn't address it, and the author is now ending the friendship. The girlfriend might feel that the friendship is important, and the author's reaction is not fair.\n\nAnother angle: the author used surveillance (Fitbit) without consent, which can damage trust. Even if he found out through that method, his response could be seen as disproportionate. The friend might not have intended harm, and cutting off the friendship could be too much. The author is making a decision that affects his girlfriend's social life based on a single message, which might not be justified.\n\nSo, the answer could be A (author is in the wrong) because he's using a harsh punishment (ending the friendship) over a joke and invading privacy. However, if the author believes it's a breach of trust, others might see it as B. But generally, controlling behavior and cutting off friends without the person's consent is often seen as wrong. So leaning towards A.\n"
