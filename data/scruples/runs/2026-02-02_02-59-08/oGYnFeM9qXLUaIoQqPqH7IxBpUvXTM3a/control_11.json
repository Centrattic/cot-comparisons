She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is wrong for cutting off his girlfriend's friend because the friend called another co-worker her \"boyfriend.\" \n\nFirst, the situation: The girlfriend has been friends with this coworker for three years. The author is okay with her interacting with coworkers, even noting that the coworker (Sam) only talks to her. The friend made a joke calling another co-worker (Sam) her \"boyfriend,\" and the girlfriend deleted messages, but the author found out via her Fitbit. He then told her to stop being friends with the coworker because the friend was disrespective.\n\nThe main issue is whether the author is overreacting. The friend's comment was a joke, and the girlfriend didn't engage with it. The author is cutting off the friendship based on one instance. Also, the girlfriend didn't know the author saw the message, and she might have thought it was a harmless joke. \n\nJealousy can be a red flag, especially if it's leading to controlling behavior. The author is making a big decision (cutting off a friend) over a minor joke. Additionally, the girlfriend didn't do anything inappropriate; she just deleted messages, which is common in relationships. The author's reasoning seems to be about the friend's comment, but it's unclear if the friend was aware of the romantic relationship. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. Instead of cutting off the friend immediately, discussing the issue with the girlfriend and the friend might have been a better approach. The author's actions might be seen as controlling or not trusting his girlfriend, especially since she didn't act on the joke. \n\nConsidering all that, the author's reaction seems excessive. He's punishing the girlfriend for a friend's comment, which could be seen as unfair. The answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
