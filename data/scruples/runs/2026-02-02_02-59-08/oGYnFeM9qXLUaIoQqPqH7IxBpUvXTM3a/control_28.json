She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. So the user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for cutting off their girlfriend's friend because the friend called another co-worker her \"boyfriend.\" \n\nFirst, the girlfriend's friend, let's say her name is Sam, has been working there for three years and has been friends with the girlfriend for the same amount of time. The boyfriend is okay with her being friends with her, as long as there's no real relationship going on. The friend Sam doesn't talk to anyone else at work, just waves and maybe has some basic interactions with the girlfriend. The boyfriend trusts her because she told him that.\n\nThen, the girlfriend deletes some messages. The boyfriend finds out through her Fitbit that she erased messages. Upon confronting her, he discovers that the friend referred to another co-worker as her \"boyfriend.\" The girlfriend says she ignored the message, and the boyfriend believes her. However, he now wants her to stop being friends with the friend because the friend doesn't respect their relationship by making that joke.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether the boyfriend is justified in his reaction. Let's look at the factors:\n\n1. **Trust Issues**: The girlfriend deleted messages, which the boyfriend found out through her Fitbit. This could indicate some level of dishonesty or something to hide, but it's also possible she just wanted to keep her phone clean. The boyfriend's trust might be shaken here, but the friend's comment seems to be a joke, not an actual relationship.\n\n2. **Jealousy vs. Reasonable Concern**: The friend calling someone a \"boyfriend\" could be a joke, especially in a workplace where such terms are sometimes used playfully. But if the boyfriend is against it, maybe there's insecurity or jealousy. However, the girlfriend's friend isn't his friend, so maybe he feels that the friend disrespects their relationship.\n\n3. **Communication**: The girlfriend might not have addressed the friend's comment because she thought it was a joke. The boyfriend is now cutting the friend off, which is a significant action. Is it fair to end a three-year friendship over a single joke, especially if the friend didn't mean anything by it?\n\n4. **Boundaries in Relationships**: In relationships, both partners need to set boundaries. If the boyfriend is uncomfortable with the term \"boyfriend\" being used for a co-worker, he could have communicated that to his girlfriend earlier. Instead, he found out through deleted messages and now is taking drastic action.\n\n5. **Accusations of Asshole-ness**: The friend might have made a joke, which isn't a big deal to some, but the boyfriend's reaction is cutting off the friend. The girlfriend might feel that her friend is being unfairly targeted. The boyfriend's trust is important, but is this a valid reason to end a friendship?\n\nConsidering all these points, the boyfriend is acting out of jealousy or insecurity rather than a reasonable concern. The friend's comment was a joke, and the girlfriend didn't engage with it. Cutting off the friend seems harsh, especially since the friend isn't a threat. The boyfriend's method of finding out (using the Fitbit) might also be a privacy issue, but the user says not to focus on that.\n\nSo, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong because his reaction is disproportionate to the situation. The friend's comment was likely a joke, and cutting off a long-time friend over that isn't justified. He should have discussed his feelings with his girlfriend first, rather than taking unilateral action.\n"
