She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for cutting off his girlfriend's friend because that friend referred to another coworker as her \"boyfriend.\" \n\nFirst, the girlfriend had a friend (let's call her Jane) who called a coworker Sam her \"boyfriend.\" The author found out because the girlfriend deleted messages, and he used her Fitbit to see the deleted text where Jane made the comment. He then told the girlfriend he didn't want her to be friends with Jane anymore because she didn't respect the relationship.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether it's reasonable for the author to cut off a friend over a single joke or comment. The girlfriend's friend made a joke, and the girlfriend didn't respond. The author is taking a stance that such jokes aren't acceptable and that the friend's action shows disrespect towards the couple. \n\nNow, considering social norms, people often use terms like \"work husband\" or \"work boyfriend\" jokingly. The friend might not have intended any harm, and the girlfriend didn't react to the message. The author is now cutting off the friend based on this one instance. That could be seen as overreacting because it's a common joke and not a serious boundary violation. \n\nAlso, the author's method of finding out (using Fitbit to track deleted messages) is a bit underhanded. The girlfriend was honest about deleting messages, but the author used a loophole to get information. This might indicate a lack of trust or a controlling behavior. \n\nThe author is taking a strict stance against any casual references to other people as boyfriends, which could be seen as being overly possessive. In healthy relationships, partners discuss boundaries and communicate their feelings. Cutting off a friend without the girlfriend having a chance to address the comment herself might be too harsh, especially if the friend didn't intend any disrespect. \n\nSo, while the author's feelings are valid, his reaction might be disproportionate. The girlfriend's friend's comment was likely a joke, and the author's response of ending the friendship could be seen as the wrong approach. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
