She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author's girlfriend is friends with a coworker who's been described as a guy named Sam. They're at the same job for three years, and the coworker friend called another guy \"boyfriend,\" which the author found out through messages the girlfriend deleted. Now he wants her to stop being friends with that coworker because he thinks the friend disrespects him and the relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The girlfriend and her friend have been friends for three years, longer than their current living arrangement. The author was initially okay with the friendship because the girlfriend said Sam doesn't talk to anyone else. The issue is the friend referring to another man as the \"boyfriend,\" which the author found out through the deleted messages. The girlfriend claims she ignored the message, but the author is upset and wants the friendship to end.\n\nThe main question is whether the author is in the wrong for cutting off the friendship. Let me consider both sides. On one hand, the author feels disrespected and that the friend is making a joke about the relationship. He's also using the girlfriend's deleted messages as leverage, which might be a trust issue. On the other, the friend called someone else \"boyfriend,\" which might be a harmless joke, and the author is overreacting by cutting off the friendship. The girlfriend might be losing a friend over something minor, and the author's method of finding out (using the Fitbit) could be manipulative.\n\nThe author's trust in the relationship is important, but the way he's handling it seems extreme. The friend's comment might not be about the author, and ending the friendship without addressing it with the friend directly could be unfair. The author is also using the girlfriend's deleted messages as a way to control her, which might be problematic. The girlfriend's action of deleting messages might indicate she's hiding something, but the author's response is cutting off her friend, which might not be the right approach. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be acting out of jealousy or insecurity rather than the friend's actual actions. The friend's comment could be a joke, and the author isn't giving her the benefit of the doubt. Ending a three-year friendship over a single joke seems harsh. The author's methods of finding out (using the Fitbit) and then confronting the girlfriend are manipulative and could erode trust. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong here.\n"
