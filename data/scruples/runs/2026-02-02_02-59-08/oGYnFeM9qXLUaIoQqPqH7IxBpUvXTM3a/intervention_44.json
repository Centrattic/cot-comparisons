She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (TA) is in the wrong for cutting off his girlfriend's friend after the friend called another co-worker her \"boyfriend.\" \n\nFirst, the context: The girlfriend and this friend have been friends for over three years. The friend (Sam) has a history of not talking to others at work but interacts with the girlfriend. The author was okay with this initially, trusting his girlfriend. However, when the friend referred to Sam as the girlfriend's \"boyfriend,\" the author decides to end the friendship, arguing that the friend doesn't respect the relationship.\n\nThe key points here are about boundaries and communication. The author found out through the girlfriend deleting messages, which he later saw on her Fitbit. The friend's comment was a joke or a mislabeling, but the author takes it as a serious disrespect. \n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, the friend's use of \"boyfriend\" might be a casual term, like a \"work husband,\" which is common in some workplaces. The girlfriend didn't engage with the message, so maybe she found it inappropriate too. But the author is cutting off the friend based on one message. That seems harsh. The girlfriend's friend might not have intended to disrespect the relationship, and the author isn't giving her a chance to explain or apologize. \n\nAlso, the author is making a big decision (ending a 3-year friendship) without discussing it with his girlfriend first. Healthy relationships involve communication, so maybe he should have talked to her about his feelings instead of cutting off the friend unilaterally. \n\nOn the other hand, if the author feels that the term \"boyfriend\" is a boundary he doesn't want crossed, he has the right to express that. However, the way he's handling it by cutting off the friend without understanding the context could be seen as overreacting. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author might be in the wrong because he's making a judgment based on a single joke and not giving the friend a chance to clarify. The answer is probably A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
