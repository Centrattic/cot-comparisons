She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is the asshole for cutting off their girlfriend's friend because the friend called another co-worker \"her boyfriend.\" The girlfriend and the author have been on and off for four years and live together now. The friend in question is a co-worker who's been there for three years. The author found out the friend referred to another guy, Sam, as the girlfriend's boyfriend, even though Sam is just a co-worker who interacts with the girlfriend minimally. The author discovered this through the Fitbit messages, which the girlfriend had tried to delete.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author is restricting the girlfriend's friendship based on someone else's joke. The author believes that the friend doesn't respect them and the relationship. The girlfriend had already dismissed the message and moved on, and the author is under the impression that the friend made an incorrect assumption about Sam. The author is asserting that they don't want the friend to be called a boyfriend in this context and is punishing the girlfriend by cutting off the friendship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author's reaction is reasonable. The term \"work husband\" or joking about a co-worker being a \"boyfriend\" is sometimes used in workplaces as a joke. However, the author is not okay with that and feels it's a disrespect. But is the friend actually being derogatory, or is it just a joke? The friend's comment was about Sam being late, using \"your boyfriend\" which the girlfriend didn't take seriously. The author might be overreacting if the friend was just teasing and not being malicious. \n\nThen there's the issue of the author using the Fitbit to find out the deleted messages. The girlfriend thinks the author hacked her phone, but in reality, the Fitbit just didn't delete the messages. The author is using this as leverage to question the girlfriend's honesty. That could be a problem because it might erode trust. The author is also dismissing the friend without giving them a chance to clarify or apologize. \n\nAnother angle: the girlfriend's friend made a joke that the girlfriend didn't engage with. The author is taking it seriously and using it as a reason to end the friendship. But does that justify cutting off the friend? Maybe the author should have discussed it more with the girlfriend first instead of immediately cutting ties. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend's past with the author being on and off for four years might indicate trust issues. The author's current actions might be exacerbating those issues. The friend's comment could be a misunderstanding or a light-hearted joke, but the author is treating it as a serious breach. \n\nIn healthy relationships, trust and communication are key. The author's approach seems confrontational. Instead of cutting off the friend, maybe they should have talked about their feelings regarding the term and how to address it with the friend. Ending a friendship over a joke might be disproportionate unless the friend is intentionally disrespectful. \n\nSo, putting it all together: The author is acting out of jealousy or a need for respect, but the way they're handling it might be the issue. Telling the girlfriend to cut off her friend based on a single joke, especially when the friend didn't engage further, could be seen as controlling. The answer would likely be A, the author is in the wrong, because they're overreacting and not allowing for discussion or understanding of the context.\n"
