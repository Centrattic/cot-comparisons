She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for cutting off his girlfriend's friend because she referred to a co-worker as her \"boyfriend.\" \n\nFirst, the girlfriend had a three-year friendship with this coworker. The author allowed this friendship initially because the girlfriend said the coworker didn't talk to anyone else. Now, the issue arises when the friend calls another co-worker (Sam) her \"boyfriend,\" which the author sees as disrespectful.\n\nThe girlfriend deleted messages, but the author found out through her Fitbit. The key message was the friend referring to Sam as her boyfriend. The author then tells the girlfriend to end the friendship because the friend doesn't respect him or their relationship.\n\nNow, considering boundaries in relationships: the author feels that the friend overstepped by using the term \"boyfriend,\" which the author finds unacceptable. However, the girlfriend didn't engage with the message and moved on. The friend might have been joking, as the author acknowledges that people sometimes use \"work husband\" terms innocently. \n\nIs cutting off the friend a reasonable response? The author is imposing his standards on the friend without the girlfriend having first addressed the issue with her friend. The girlfriend might have had a different view on the friend's comment. By ending the friendship himself without discussing it with her first, the author is taking a unilateral decision, which could be controlling.\n\nAlso, the history of phone checking and message deletion adds tension. The author used the Fitbit to find out about deleted messages, which might indicate trust issues. Reacting by cutting off the friend based on one comment could be seen as overreacting, especially if the friend wasn't aware of the couple's strict boundaries.\n\nIn terms of communication, the author didn't give the girlfriend a chance to address the friend, assuming she should have done so. This might not respect her autonomy in managing her friendships. The friend's comment, while perhaps inconsiderate, doesn't necessarily justify ending the friendship unless there's a pattern of disrespect.\n\nSo, the author's actions could be seen as overly controlling and not respecting the girlfriend's agency in her relationships. The friend's comment might be a minor issue that the author is blowing out of proportion. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because he's imposing his will without proper discussion and overreacting to a minor incident.\n"
