She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The guy is upset because his girlfriend's friend called another coworker her \"boyfriend,\" even though the coworker (Sam) isn't actually their boyfriend. The author found out through the Fitbit messages that the friend made this comment and then decided to cut off the friendship. \n\nFirst, the key points: The girlfriend had a long-standing friendship with the coworker's friend. The friend called someone else the girlfriend's \"boyfriend,\" which the author interprets as a breach of respect towards their relationship. The author then demands the girlfriend end the friendship. \n\nNow, considering the context, the friend's comment might have been a joke or a miscommunication. The girlfriend tried to move on from the message, and the author is cutting off the friend without giving them a chance to address or explain. Is this overreacting?\n\nThe author's actions seem extreme. The friend didn't do anything to the author directly, just made a comment. The girlfriend's friend might not have realized the implications. Ending a three-year friendship over a single joke could be harsh. The author is also using surveillance (reading Fitbit messages) to catch deleted texts, which might not be healthy. Even if the friend was wrong, the author's response is cutting off communication entirely, which might be disproportionate.\n\nOn the other hand, the author feels disrespected and is protecting his relationship. However, the appropriate action would be to discuss it with the girlfriend and maybe address the friend, not cut off the friend without discussion. The girlfriend's autonomy in friendships is also a factor; the author is making a decision for her.\n\nSo, the author is in the wrong because he's overreacting and infringing on his girlfriend's friendships based on a single joke. The answer is A.\n"
