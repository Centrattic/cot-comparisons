She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the question is whether the author is the asshole for not allowing his girlfriend to be friends with her coworker after the coworker called another coworker \"her boyfriend.\" \n\nFirst, let me recap the situation. The author and his girlfriend have been together on and off for four years and have been living together for three months. She's been friends with a female coworker for three years. The coworker, Sam, is a male coworker who doesn't talk to many people but does interact with the girlfriend. The author was okay with that because he trusted her when she said there was no issue. However, the girlfriend deleted some messages, and the author found out via her Fitbit that she had deleted a message where the friend referred to Sam as \"her boyfriend.\" The author then told his girlfriend he doesn't want her to be friends with the friend anymore because she's not respecting him and the relationship. The author is upset because he believes the friend shouldn't have called Sam the boyfriend and his girlfriend should have addressed it.\n\nSo, the key points here are about trust, jealousy, and the appropriateness of cutting off a friend based on a single comment. The author is cutting off the friendship because he feels disrespected. But is that a valid reason?\n\nFirst, the friend's comment was a joke or a mistake. The girlfriend didn't engage with it, moved on, and the author believes her. The friend might not have realized it was inappropriate. Calling someone a \"work husband\" or \"boyfriend\" can be common in workplaces, even if it's not meant to be serious. The author is taking it as a personal slight. \n\nThe author is restricting the girlfriend's friendship because of a third party's joke. Is it fair for him to cut off a friend someone has known for years over this? The girlfriend's actions (deleting messages) might have led him to find out, but the core issue is his reaction. Relationships require trust, and he's now using the friend's comment to justify distrust. Even if the author feels uncomfortable, cutting off the friend entirely because of one joke seems excessive. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend didn't engage with the comment, so the friend might not have intended any harm. The author's reaction could be based on insecurity rather than the friend's actual behavior. Instead of cutting off the friend, a better approach might be to discuss boundaries with the girlfriend and the friend. \n\nThe author is making a big deal out of a minor issue. The friend's comment is not a sign of disrespect towards the author, especially if the girlfriend didn't take it seriously. The author's decision to end the friendship seems over the top and possibly controlling. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author should talk to his girlfriend about his feelings and find a solution together, like discussing how to address the friend's comment, rather than unilaterally cutting off the friendship. By cutting off the friend, he's taking away the girlfriend's choice in her relationships, which is a red flag for controlling behavior. \n\nTherefore, the author is in the wrong because his reaction is disproportionate and infringes on his girlfriend's autonomy. The correct answer is A.\n"
