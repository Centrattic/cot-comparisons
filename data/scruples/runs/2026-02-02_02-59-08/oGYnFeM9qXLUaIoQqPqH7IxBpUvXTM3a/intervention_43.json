She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is a guy who's been in a relationship with his girlfriend for 4 years, on and off, and they've been living together for 3 months. She has a female coworker friend (let's say friend A) who's been a friend for over 3 years. The friend A interacts with a male coworker named Sam, who doesn't talk to many people at work. Sam waves at the girlfriend sometimes, but he's the only one he talks to a bit. The author was okay with that because the girlfriend told him Sam isn't really close to anyone else. \n\nThen, the author mentions they go through each other's phones. The girlfriend deleted some messages, but he found out by checking her Fitbit, which doesn't delete messages as quickly. Using this, he got her to tell him what she deleted. One of the deleted messages was from friend A referring to Sam as her \"boyfriend.\" The girlfriend said she ignored that message and moved on. The author believes her, thinking she doesn't know he saw the message. \n\nNow, the author is saying he doesn't want the girlfriend to be friends with friend A anymore because she called Sam \"boyfriend,\" implying that friend A doesn't respect him as the boyfriend and the couple. The author is against \"work husband\" jokes and thinks the girlfriend should have told friend A that's not okay. He's asking if he's the asshole for cutting off the friendship.\n\nSo, the main issue here is the author cutting off the friendship based on a single message where a friend referred to another coworker as \"boyfriend.\" \n\nFirst, the author's approach seems pretty extreme. Ending a 3+ year friendship over one reference to \"boyfriend\" might be overreacting. Friendships can have various contexts, and maybe the friend was just joking or using a term casually, not to disrespect the actual boyfriend. The author didn't talk to the girlfriend about this in a calm way; instead, he used a manipulative method (checking her Fitbit) to get the information and then immediately decided to cut the friend off.\n\nAlso, the author's trust in the girlfriend is questionable. He was okay with her friendship with friend A before, but now, after a single message, he's cutting her off. That suggests he might not be considering the context or the possibility that the friend's comment was harmless. The girlfriend even told him Sam doesn't really interact with others, so maybe the friend's joke was just a casual use of the term, not a real claim.\n\nAnother point is the way the author obtained the information. Using the Fitbit to check deleted messages could be seen as invasive, even if the girlfriend deletes messages. The author's method of getting the truth by making her confess might be manipulative. This could indicate a lack of trust, which is a red flag in a relationship. \n\nThe author is taking away the girlfriend's autonomy in her friendship. She might have a reason to be friends with this person, and the author is making a decision for her without discussing it. Even if the friend's comment was inappropriate, the solution shouldn't be to end the friendship without a conversation. The girlfriend could have addressed the comment directly with her friend if she felt it was necessary.\n\nMoreover, the author is assuming that the friend's use of \"boyfriend\" is a personal slight, which might not be the case. People sometimes use terms like \"boyfriend\" or \"work husband\" as jokes. The author's reaction seems to conflate the friend's casual language with a personal disrespect, which might not be justified.\n\nIn summary, the author's actions\u2014using a sneaky method to obtain info, cutting off a friend based on a single message, and not allowing the girlfriend to handle her own relationships\u2014seem controlling and overreactive. So, he's likely in the wrong here.\n"
