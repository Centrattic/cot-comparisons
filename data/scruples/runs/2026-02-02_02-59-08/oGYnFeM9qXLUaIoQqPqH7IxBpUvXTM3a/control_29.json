She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for cutting off his girlfriend's friend because the friend called another co-worker her \"boyfriend.\" \n\nFirst, the situation: The girlfriend (28) has been friends with a coworker (Sam) for over three years. The author is okay with the friendship initially. Then, the girlfriend deletes some messages, and the author finds out that their friend referred to Sam as her \"boyfriend\" through the Fitbit. The author then tells the girlfriend to stop being friends with her because the friend disrespects them.\n\nSo, key points here: The friend called Sam her \"boyfriend,\" which the author takes as a problem. The author uses the girlfriend's Fitbit to find out about the messages she deleted. The girlfriend didn't address the friend's comment, and the author is upset about that. He then cuts off the friendship.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, the friend's comment might be a joke or a work-related term, but the author seems to take it as a serious issue. The girlfriend didn't correct the friend, which could be an oversight. The author's reaction is to end the friendship, which is a big step. \n\nBut does the friend's comment actually affect the relationship? If Sam is just a coworker and the friend jokingly called him that, maybe the author is overreacting. The girlfriend might have thought it was harmless. However, the author's trust could be an issue here. He used the Fitbit to monitor her, which isn't healthy. That behavior might have contributed to the situation. \n\nAlso, cutting off a friend over a joke could be seen as extreme. The author is removing the friend because of one comment, which might not be fair. The friend might not have intended to disrespect the relationship. The author's actions could be seen as controlling, especially with the phone monitoring and then ending the friendship without discussing it properly. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might feel that the friend's comment is inappropriate, given their relationship. However, the way he handled it\u2014using surveillance and then cutting off the friend\u2014indicates a lack of trust and communication. The girlfriend didn't address the comment, which is on her too, but the author's response is harsh. \n\nI think the main issue here is the author's method of finding out the information (using Fitbit to snoop) and then using that as a reason to end the friendship. That's where the problem is. The friend's comment might be minor, but the author's approach is problematic. So the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because he's overreacting and using invasive methods to control his girlfriend's relationships.\n"
