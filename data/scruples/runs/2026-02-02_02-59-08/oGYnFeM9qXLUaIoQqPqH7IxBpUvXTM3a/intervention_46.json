She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (the person asking \"Am I the asshole?\") is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's girlfriend (GF) and her friend who works with her. The friend called another coworker \"her boyfriend,\" leading the author to demand that the GF stop being friends with her.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The GF has known the friend for 3+ years, and the author was initially okay with their friendship. The issue arises when the friend refers to a coworker as \"boyfriend,\" which the author finds disrespectful. The author discovered this through the GF's deleted messages and used a Fitbit message to confront her. The GF claims she ignored the message and moved on, and the author is now cutting off the friendship.\n\nNow, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider the factors. The author's reaction seems pretty extreme in cutting off the friendship over a single instance. The friend might have been joking or using a term like \"work husband,\" which is common in workplaces where people are close. The GF didn't escalate the issue, but the author took it upon himself to end the friendship without discussing it properly.\n\nThe author's actions include using the GF's deleted messages (via Fitbit) to confront her, which might be a breach of trust. Also, cutting off a long-term friend based on one comment could be seen as controlling. The friend might have been unaware that their words would cause such a reaction. The author is making a judgment about the friend's respect without giving them a chance to explain or apologize. \n\nHowever, the author does have a right to feel disrespected if he's not okay with his partner having a \"work husband.\" But the way he's handling it\u2014cutting off the friend abruptly and without discussion\u2014could be seen as overreacting. The GF might have a right to maintain her friendships, and the author's decision might be infringing on her autonomy without sufficient reason.\n\nIn typical \"Am I the Asshole?\" scenarios, being controlling or overreacting to minor issues often leads to the \"A\" answer (in the wrong). The author is using private information to pressure the GF and is making a significant decision about her friendships without her input. The friend's comment might not have been intended maliciously, and the author's response is disproportionately harsh. Therefore, the answer is likely A.\n"
