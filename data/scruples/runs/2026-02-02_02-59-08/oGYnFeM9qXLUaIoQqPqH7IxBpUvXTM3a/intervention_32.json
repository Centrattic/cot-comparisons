She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for cutting off his girlfriend's friend because that friend called another coworker \"boyfriend.\" \n\nFirst, the boyfriend found out the friend called Sam, a coworker, the girlfriend's boyfriend. The girlfriend says she ignored the message and moved on. The boyfriend then decides she can't be friends with the friend anymore because the friend doesn't respect him as the man in the relationship.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about boundaries and communication. The girlfriend had been friends with this person for three years, and the boyfriend trusted her initially. The friend made a comment that might be seen as crossing a line, but the girlfriend didn't find it problematic enough to address with the friend. \n\nThe boyfriend is asserting control over who his partner can be friends with based on a joke. But is that reasonable? Friends can make jokes without intending harm, and the girlfriend didn't confront the friend, so maybe she didn't see it as a big issue. The boyfriend is reacting strongly by cutting off the friendship, which might be overreacting. \n\nAlso, the way he found out through checking her Fitbit and pressuring her to reveal deleted messages could undermine trust. Even if he's justified in being upset, the method of surveillance might contribute to the problem. \n\nOn the other hand, he's in a committed relationship and might feel that the term \"boyfriend\" is a boundary issue. But relationships require communication. Instead of cutting off the friend immediately, maybe discussing his feelings with the girlfriend first would be better. \n\nSo, the author is making a decision for both himself and his girlfriend about her friendship without her input. That seems like it's not respecting her autonomy. The friend's comment was a joke, but the boyfriend is taking it as a serious disrespect. It's possible he's overreacting. \n\nTherefore, the answer is probably A, the author is in the wrong because he's being controlling without proper communication and overreacting to a joke.\n"
