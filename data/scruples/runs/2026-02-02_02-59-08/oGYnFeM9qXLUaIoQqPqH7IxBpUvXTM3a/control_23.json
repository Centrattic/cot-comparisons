She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for cutting off their girlfriend's friend because the friend called a co-worker \"her boyfriend.\" \n\nFirst, the girlfriend has been friends with this person for three years. The co-worker, Sam, only interacts with her and isn't close with others. The author was initially okay with that but now, after finding out the friend referred to Sam as the girlfriend's boyfriend, he's cutting off the friendship. \n\nThe key points here: The friend made a joke by calling Sam the girlfriend's boyfriend, which the author finds disrespectful. The author discovered this through messages the girlfriend deleted but still sees via her Fitbit. The author then tells the girlfriend to stop being friends with the person.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, cutting off a long-term friendship over a joke might be harsh. The friend's comment seems like a light-hearted joke, not a serious breach. The author is acting on jealousy, which is understandable, but the response might be disproportionate. Also, using the Fitbit to monitor messages could be manipulative. The author is taking away the girlfriend's choice in her friendship without considering if the friend was being malicious. The girlfriend might feel her autonomy is being violated. So, the answer is likely A (author is in the wrong) because his reaction is extreme and controlling.\n"
