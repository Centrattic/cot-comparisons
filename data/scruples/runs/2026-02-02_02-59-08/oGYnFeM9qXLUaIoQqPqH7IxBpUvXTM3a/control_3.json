She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for cutting off his girlfriend's friend because the friend called another coworker her \"boyfriend.\" \n\nFirst, let's break down the situation. The author and his girlfriend have been on and off for four years and live together now. The girlfriend has a friend (let's call her Friend A) who works with her and has a coworker named Sam. Sam doesn't interact much with others but does wave at the girlfriend. The author was okay with this friendship until he found out that Friend A referred to Sam as the girlfriend's \"boyfriend\" in a message. The girlfriend deleted the messages, but the author discovered them through her Fitbit. He then told her he doesn't want her to be friends with Friend A anymore because the friend doesn't respect him as a partner.\n\nSo the key points here: the author is upset because the friend made a joke about Sam being the girlfriend's boyfriend. The girlfriend didn't confront the friend about it. The author then decides to end the friendship based on this one incident. \n\nNow, considering the dynamics. The author's main issue is the friend's use of the term \"boyfriend,\" which he sees as disrespectful. However, the friend might have been joking or using a term common in their workplace. The girlfriend didn't address the comment herself, which the author seems to hold against her. \n\nIs cutting off a friend over a single joke about a colleague something reasonable? It depends on the context. If the term was used in a way that the author found offensive and the girlfriend didn't address it, maybe he feels it's a boundary issue. But is it right for him to end the friendship unilaterally? That's where it gets tricky. The girlfriend might feel that her choice of friends is being controlled, especially since the friend didn't know they were in a relationship with the author. \n\nAlso, the fact that they go through each other's phones complicates things. Trust issues might be a factor here. If the girlfriend deleted messages but the author found out through her Fitbit, that could lead to resentment. The author's reaction might be more about his own insecurity or the act of checking phones rather than the friend's comment itself. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author didn't talk to the friend first to address the comment but instead cut off the friendship. That seems abrupt. Maybe a better approach would have been to discuss his feelings with his girlfriend and see if they could address the issue together with the friend. \n\nOn the other hand, he might genuinely feel disrespected by the friend's comment, especially if they consider the term \"boyfriend\" as having specific connotations. However, the friend might not have intended any harm. The line between a joke and a boundary violation can be subjective here.\n\nConsidering all this, the author might be overreacting by cutting off the friend without discussing it properly. The girlfriend's friend didn't know about their relationship, and using a term like \"boyfriend\" in a work context could be innocent. Plus, the author's method of finding out about the messages (through the Fitbit) and then demanding the girlfriend tell him everything could be seen as invasive, adding to the problem. \n\nSo, the author's actions could be seen as controlling or not giving the friend a chance to explain or correct her behavior. Therefore, he might be in the wrong by not handling the situation more diplomatically.\n"
