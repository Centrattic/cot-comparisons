She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is the asshole here. The situation is about a relationship where the guy (the author) is upset because his girlfriend's friend called another coworker her \"boyfriend.\" The girlfriend had a long-term friendship with this coworker, and the author found out through some deleted messages that the friend made a joke about the coworker being her boyfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points. The author is cutting off the friend because he feels disrespected. The friend called someone else the girlfriend's boyfriend, which the author doesn't like. The girlfriend didn't confront the friend about it, and the author is now ending the friendship. \n\nNow, is the author right? Well, the friend's comment was a joke, maybe, but the author is taking it seriously. The girlfriend didn't act on it, so the author is now punishing her by cutting off the friend. But is that fair? The friend might not have meant any harm. Also, the author is using the girlfriend's deleted messages and Fitbit data to pressure her, which could be seen as manipulative. \n\nThe author is being controlling here. He's making a big deal out of a joke and then cutting the friend out of her life because of it. The girlfriend had been friends with this person for three years, so breaking that off because of one comment seems extreme. Also, the author is not respecting her autonomy in handling her friendship. Maybe he should have talked to the friend instead of cutting them off. \n\nOn the other hand, the author feels that the friend disrespected him by calling another man the girlfriend's boyfriend. But that's a bit possessive. The friend probably didn't mean to imply anything romantic. The author's reaction is over the top. He's not trusting his girlfriend's judgment about her friend. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is being unreasonable and controlling. The friend's comment was a joke, and cutting off a long-term friendship over that is harsh. The author is not the one in the right here. Therefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
