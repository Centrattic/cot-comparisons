She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the author is the asshole in this situation. Let me break down the scenario.\n\nThe author is in a relationship with his girlfriend, who's been friends with a coworker for three years. The coworker, Sam, has been waving at her and is the only one he talks to. The author was okay with that initially. Then, the girlfriend deleted some messages. The author found out through her Fitbit that she had messages where her friend referred to Sam as her \"boyfriend.\" The author then told her he doesn't want her to be friends with that coworker anymore because the friend doesn't respect him and the relationship. The question is whether the author is wrong for cutting off the friendship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The girlfriend's friend called Sam her \"boyfriend,\" which the author found offensive. The girlfriend claims she ignored the message and moved on. The author is trusting her but is upset that the friend used that term. \n\nNow, the key points: Did the friend overstep by calling someone else the girlfriend's boyfriend? That's a judgment call. Some people might see it as a joke or a term of endearment, but others might find it disrespectful, especially in a relationship. The author is against work relationships or \"work husbands,\" which is his right. However, cutting off the friendship entirely because of one message might be an overreaction. \n\nAlso, the author used the Fitbit to find out about the deleted messages. While the girlfriend did delete the messages, the author's method of using her Fitbit could be seen as an invasion of privacy. Even if he found out through that means, the response of ending the friendship might be too harsh. \n\nThe girlfriend's friend might not have intended harm, and the girlfriend handled it by ignoring the message. The author's reaction seems to be more about his own insecurity or boundaries. However, in a relationship, both partners should communicate their boundaries. If the author was against any \"boyfriend\" or \"work husband\" type relationships, that should have been discussed earlier. \n\nBut the author is now cutting off a friend based on one instance, which could be seen as controlling or not giving the friend a chance to correct her behavior. The right approach might have been to talk to the friend and express the issue rather than ending the friendship abruptly. \n\nSo, putting it all together: The author has a valid concern about the term used, but his response is extreme. The friend's action was a mistake, but cutting off the friendship isn't necessarily justified unless there's a pattern of disrespect. The author might be overstepping by not giving the friend a chance to address it. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
