She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is the asshole (AITA) for cutting off their girlfriend's friend because the friend called another coworker her \"boyfriend.\" \n\nFirst, the girlfriend has been friends with this coworker for three years. The author is okay with the friend until they find out she called another guy \"boyfriend.\" The author discovered this through deleted messages, which the girlfriend didn't know they could track via her Fitbit. The friend's message was a joke: \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night.\" The girlfriend claims she ignored it, but the author still decides to end the friendship because they feel disrespected.\n\nNow, considering the situation: The friend made a joke, which might be common in workplaces. The author is upset because they don't like the term \"work husband\" or joking about other people as boyfriends. The girlfriend didn't act on the message, just ignored it. But the author is punishing the friend for a joke, ending the friendship. \n\nIs that fair? The friend didn't do anything malicious. The girlfriend didn't engage with the joke. The author's reaction seems harsh. The friend's action was a minor joke, not a serious breach. The author might be overreacting, especially since they found out through the girlfriend's deleted messages, which might indicate trust issues. Ending a three-year friendship over a joke could be seen as extreme. So, the author is in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
