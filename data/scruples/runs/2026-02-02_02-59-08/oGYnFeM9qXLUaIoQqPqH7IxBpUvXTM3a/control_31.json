She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for cutting off his girlfriend's friend after she called another coworker \"boyfriend.\" The situation involves some trust issues and jealousy.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend and the friend have been working together for over three years. The friend (let's call her Jane) had mentioned Sam, another coworker, as her \"boyfriend,\" which the author found objectionable. The author discovered this through deleted messages, which the girlfriend later revealed via her Fitbit. The author then told his girlfriend to stop being friends with Jane because she disrespected their relationship.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics here. The friend called Sam a \"boyfriend,\" which the author interprets as a breach of respect. But is that a valid reason to cut off the friend? In relationships, boundaries can vary. Some people are okay with friends having \"work husbands/wives,\" others aren't. The author seems to be against it, but does that justify ending the friendship?\n\nThe girlfriend tried to downplay it, saying she ignored the message. The author, upon learning about the message, decided to end the friendship. However, the friend might not have realized how the term \"boyfriend\" would affect the author. It's possible the friend was joking or using a term common in their workplace without ill intent.\n\nBut the main issue is the author's reaction. Cutting off a long-time friend based on a single message might be overly harsh. The girlfriend might have a right to her own friendships, especially given their history. The author's actions could be seen as controlling, especially considering they had gone through each other's phones, which is a red flag for trust issues.\n\nAlso, the author might be overstepping by assuming the friend's intent was malicious. Maybe the friend didn't mean anything by it. The author should have discussed the issue with his girlfriend and maybe had a conversation with the friend to express his feelings instead of cutting her off abruptly.\n\nAdditionally, the way the author found out about the messages\u2014through a Fitbit\u2014suggests a pattern of checking up on her, which isn't healthy. This could indicate a lack of trust, which is a bigger problem than the original incident.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the author is acting out of jealousy and a lack of trust. While he has a right to feel upset, cutting off a friend over a potentially innocent comment is extreme. The healthy approach would be communication and setting boundaries without removing the friend entirely. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong.\n"
