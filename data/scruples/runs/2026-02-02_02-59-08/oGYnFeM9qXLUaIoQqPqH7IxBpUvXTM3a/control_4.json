She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who posted the situation is the asshole (AITA) for cutting off their girlfriend's friend because the friend called someone else \"boyfriend\" in a message. \n\nFirst, the girlfriend and her friend have been friends for over three years. The friend, let's call her Sarah, refers to a co-worker, Sam, as the girlfriend's \"boyfriend,\" which the girlfriend's partner (the poster) finds unacceptable. The poster found out about this through deleted messages that were still visible on the girlfriend's Fitbit. The girlfriend claims she ignored the message and moved on, but the poster is now cutting off the friendship because the friend doesn't respect their relationship.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the friend made a joke by calling Sam the girlfriend's boyfriend, the girlfriend didn't address it, and the partner is ending the friendship over it. \n\nI need to consider the dynamics of relationships. Generally, friends can have playful nicknames or jokes, especially in workplace settings. The friend might have intended it as a joke, not a serious claim. The girlfriend didn't correct her friend at the time, which could imply that she didn't take issue with it. The partner, however, now wants to cut off the friend because they feel disrespected. \n\nIs the partner overreacting? Well, if the friend had a history of making such jokes, maybe the partner's reaction is reasonable. But in this case, it's a one-off message about a co-worker who isn't dating the girlfriend. The friend's comment could be seen as a light-hearted joke, not a serious accusation. The partner's decision to end the friendship might be too harsh, especially since the girlfriend didn't object at the time. \n\nAlso, the poster is using the Fitbit data to find out about deleted messages. While that's clever, it's a bit of an invasion of privacy. However, the main issue is the reaction to the friend's comment. The partner is taking a firm stance against any use of the term \"boyfriend\" for a non-romantic relationship, which might not be typical in all relationships. Some couples might be more lenient about such jokes among friends, especially if there's no history of jealousy. \n\nOn the other hand, the partner has a right to feel disrespected if they believe the friend is mocking the relationship. However, cutting off a three-year friendship over a single joke seems extreme. The girlfriend's friend probably didn't mean any harm, and the girlfriend didn't take it seriously at the time. The partner's reaction might be based on insecurity or overstepping by taking control of the girlfriend's friendships. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The partner should have discussed their feelings with the girlfriend first, given her a chance to address the issue with her friend, or at least considered whether this was a bigger deal than it seemed. Cutting off the friend unilaterally without discussing it with the girlfriend could be seen as the partner making a decision that affects the girlfriend's personal relationships, which might not be fair. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the partner's reaction might be the asshole move here. The friend's joke, while perhaps inconsiderate, isn't a severe breach that warrants ending a long-term friendship. The partner's approach is more about controlling the girlfriend's social circle based on a minor incident. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
