She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the post) is in the wrong for cutting off their girlfriend's friend after the friend called a male coworker her \"boyfriend.\" \n\nFirst, looking at the situation: The girlfriend has been friends with this coworker for over three years. The coworker, Sam, is described as someone who doesn't talk to many people at work but interacts with the girlfriend. The author was okay with this interaction initially, trusting the girlfriend's assurance. Then, the girlfriend deleted some messages, which the author discovered via her Fitbit. The key message was the friend referring to Sam as the girlfriend's \"boyfriend.\" The author then decides the girlfriend can't be friends with her anymore because the friend doesn't respect the author as a partner.\n\nNow, evaluating if the author is wrong. The main points are jealousy over a possible \"work husband\" situation and cutting off a long-term friend based on one message. The girlfriend claims she ignored the message, but the friend's comment might be seen as a joke or harmless. The author is enforcing boundaries around how friends refer to others, which could be reasonable. However, cutting off a friend entirely over a single joke might be an overreaction. Trust and communication are important. The author's reaction seems extreme, possibly based on insecurity rather than the friend's intent. The girlfriend might feel betrayed if the author is using this as an excuse to control her friendships. Also, the author's method of finding out (via Fitbit) shows some level of surveillance, which might contribute to trust issues. Overall, while the author has a right to feel uncomfortable, cutting off the friend entirely without addressing it with the girlfriend and her friend first is likely the wrong approach. So, the author might be in the wrong (A).\n"
