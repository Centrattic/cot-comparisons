She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author (the person posting the situation) is in the wrong for cutting off their girlfriend's friend over a joke. \n\nFirst, looking at the situation: The girlfriend has been friends with a coworker for three years. The coworker, Sam, doesn't interact much with others but waves at her. The author was okay with this, trusting the girlfriend. Then, the girlfriend deletes messages, but because of the Fitbit, the author finds out that the friend referred to Sam as her \"boyfriend.\" The author then tells the girlfriend to cut off the friend because they don't respect the relationship.\n\nSo, the key points here are: The friend made a joke by referring to Sam as \"boyfriend,\" which the girlfriend didn't respond to. The author is upset about this and wants the friend to be cut off. \n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. The friend's comment seems like a joke, possibly without ill intent. The girlfriend didn't engage with it, and the author's reaction is to end the friendship over that. But is that a reasonable response?\n\nThe author's main issue is that the friend called someone else the girlfriend's \"boyfriend,\" which they see as disrespectful. However, in many workplaces, people might use terms like \"work husband\" or \"work boyfriend\" as a joke, not meant seriously. The girlfriend didn't respond to the message, so maybe she didn't find it offensive. The author is taking a strict stance against any such terms, which might be overreacting if the friend didn't mean harm. \n\nAlso, the author's discovery method involved the girlfriend's Fitbit, which she didn't know was tracking messages she thought she'd deleted. This might imply some level of invasion of privacy, but the user is told not to focus on that. Still, the main issue is whether cutting off the friend was justified. \n\nThe friend's action, while maybe insensitive, doesn't necessarily indicate disrespect towards the couple. The girlfriend's friend might not have realized the inappropriateness of the term. The author's decision to cut off the friend seems harsh, especially since it's a joke and the girlfriend herself didn't object. The author's trust in the girlfriend was already there, so maybe the issue is more about trust and insecurity rather than the friend's actual behavior. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author could have talked to the girlfriend about their discomfort with the term but cutting off the friendship abruptly without considering the context or the friend's intent might be too extreme. So, the author's action could be seen as overreacting, making them the asshole. Therefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
