She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author is asking if they're in the wrong for cutting off their girlfriend's friend because the friend called another coworker her \"boyfriend.\" \n\nFirst, the girlfriend and the friend have been friends for three years. The friend, Sam, only interacts with her at work, and that's been okay with the author until now. The main issue is that Sam referred to another coworker as the girlfriend's \"boyfriend,\" which the author found out through deleted messages. The author then decides to end the friendship because they feel disrespected.\n\nHmm, the friend called someone else \"boyfriend,\" which might be a joke. The author is upset that the friend didn't respect the relationship. But is it fair to cut off the friend over a joke? The girlfriend didn't engage with the message and moved on. The author is using this as a reason to end the friendship without discussing it with the friend first. That seems harsh. The friend might not have meant anything by it, and the author is overreacting. Also, using the girlfriend's Fitbit to find out about deleted messages is a bit underhanded, even if it worked. \n\nThe author's approach seems controlling. Instead of addressing the issue with the friend or talking to the girlfriend about boundaries, they just cut off the friend. The friend might not even know they offended the author. The author's reaction is more about feeling disrespected than the actual behavior. So, the answer is probably A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
