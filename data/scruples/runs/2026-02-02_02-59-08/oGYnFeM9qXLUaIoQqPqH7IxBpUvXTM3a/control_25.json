She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong for cutting off his girlfriend's friend because the friend called another co-worker her \"boyfriend.\" \n\nFirst, the girlfriend has been friends with this person for over three years. The friend, Sam, has only interacted with her at work, and the boyfriend was okay with that initially. The issue arose when the friend referred to another co-worker as her \"boyfriend,\" which the boyfriend found offensive.\n\nThe girlfriend deleted messages, but it's revealed that the Fitbit messages showed she had a conversation where the friend called Sam her \"boyfriend.\" The boyfriend then decided to end the friendship because he felt disrespected. He's asking if he's the asshole for doing so.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics here. The boyfriend's reaction is based on jealousy and a lack of trust. Even though he found out through the Fitbit that messages were deleted, the main issue is the friend's comment. The friend might have been joking, but the boyfriend doesn't accept that. However, cutting off a friend over a single joke, especially one that might be innocent, seems extreme. The girlfriend didn't engage with the comment, so she might have already addressed it. The boyfriend's threat to end the friendship without discussing it further could be seen as overreacting. Also, the fact that he's using this as a reason to control her social interactions might indicate an issue with trust and communication in their relationship. So, while the friend's comment was inconsiderate, the boyfriend's response might be more about his own insecurities than the actual situation. Therefore, he might be the asshole here.\n"
