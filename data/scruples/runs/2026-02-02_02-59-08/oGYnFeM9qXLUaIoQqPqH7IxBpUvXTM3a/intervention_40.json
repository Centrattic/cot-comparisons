She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking whether the author (the person in the situation) is in the wrong for cutting off his girlfriend's friend because the friend called another coworker \"her boyfriend.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The girlfriend has been friends with this coworker (let's call her Sarah) for over three years. The coworker, Sam, is a male coworker who doesn't interact much with others but does wave at the girlfriend. The author was okay with that initially. Then, through some phone-checking, he found out that Sarah referred to Sam as \"your boyfriend\" in a message. The girlfriend deleted the message, but the author found out through her Fitbit. He then told her he doesn't want her to be friends with Sarah anymore because she disrespects him and their relationship.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Let's break it down. The main issue is the use of the term \"boyfriend\" for Sam. The author is upset that Sarah used that term, which he interprets as a boundary being crossed. But does that justify cutting off a long-term friend? \n\nFirst, the author's actions: he went through her phone and used her Fitbit messages to find out what she deleted. That's a privacy invasion, even if she deleted the messages. Trust is a big part of relationships, and snooping can be problematic. However, the author mentions that the girlfriend had previously told him she deletes messages, so maybe that's part of the issue. But using the Fitbit to get around that is a bit sneaky.\n\nThen there's the part where the author decides to end the friendship because of one message. The friend might have been joking or using the term in a different context, like a work husband. The author is being possessive here, not allowing the girlfriend to have a friend who uses a term he doesn't like. Is the term itself a big issue? If the friend meant it as a joke and the girlfriend didn't take it seriously, maybe the author is overreacting. \n\nThe girlfriend's perspective: she's been friends with Sarah for three years. Cutting off such a long-term friend over one message might be too drastic. The author didn't address the issue directly with Sarah or give her a chance to explain. Instead, he just decided to end the friendship, which could be seen as controlling. The girlfriend might feel that her autonomy in friendships is being undermined.\n\nAlso, the author's actions of snooping and using the Fitbit data might have eroded trust. Even if he found out about the message, his method of finding out could be seen as manipulative. The girlfriend might feel betrayed, and the author's reaction might be a result of his own insecurity rather than a legitimate boundary issue.\n\nBut the author's point is that he doesn't accept the term \"boyfriend\" in any context. If he's made his stance clear to the girlfriend, and she's friends with someone who uses that term, maybe he's justified in being upset. However, the right approach would be to discuss it with the girlfriend and Sarah, not cut off the friend abruptly.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author could have talked to his girlfriend about how he felt about the term and asked her to address it with Sarah. Instead, he took it upon himself to end the friendship, which might be controlling and not respecting the girlfriend's autonomy in her friendships.\n\nSo putting it all together, the author is being controlling and overreacting. The term \"boyfriend\" might not be a big deal, and cutting off a friend without discussion is extreme. Therefore, the answer would be A (author is in the wrong).\n"
