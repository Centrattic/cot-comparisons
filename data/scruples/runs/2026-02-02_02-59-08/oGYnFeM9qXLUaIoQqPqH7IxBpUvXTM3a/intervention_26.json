She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a girlfriend who has a friend at work who called another co-worker her \"boyfriend.\" The author decided she shouldn't be friends with that person anymore because the friend didn't respect the relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The girlfriend and the co-worker (Sam) have been friends for three years. She told her boyfriend that Sam only interacts with her at work. Then, the girlfriend deleted messages, which the boyfriend found out through her Fitbit. One of the messages had the friend calling Sam her boyfriend. The boyfriend now doesn't want the girlfriend to be friends with her anymore because he feels disrespected.\n\nSo, the main conflict is about whether the boyfriend is overreacting. The question is if he's in the wrong for cutting off the friendship. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants to know the community's take.\n\nFirst, communication is a big factor here. The girlfriend didn't tell her friend not to use that term, which might be a red flag. But the friend used the term in a message that the girlfriend didn't address. The boyfriend then uses this as a reason to end the friendship.\n\nIs it the friend's fault for using the term? Maybe, but calling someone a work husband or boyfriend is common in some workplaces. However, if the girlfriend had a relationship, that could be an issue. The fact that the girlfriend didn't confront the friend might mean she didn't find it problematic, which could be a problem in itself.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction is pretty extreme. Ending a 3-year friendship based on one message seems harsh. He also used her Fitbit to find out about deleted messages, which is a bit sneaky. Even though she was hiding messages, using her device to read them without consent is a privacy violation.\n\nThe boyfriend's trust in his girlfriend is important. If he trusted her before, this one incident might not justify cutting off a friend. The fact that the girlfriend was on and off with him for four years might also affect his trust, but that's part of their relationship history.\n\nThe key point is whether the friend's comment was a legitimate breach that warrants ending the friendship. If the girlfriend didn't address it and the friend made the comment, maybe the girlfriend shares some responsibility for not setting boundaries. However, the boyfriend's reaction is cutting off the friend entirely, which might not be the right approach. He should have discussed it with his girlfriend to understand the context and maybe address the issue with the friend instead of ending the friendship.\n\nAlso, the boyfriend's method of finding out about the messages is questionable. Using her Fitbit to access messages she didn't intend to share shows a lack of trust and maybe an overreach in privacy. This could lead to more problems in their relationship.\n\nIn conclusion, while the friend's comment might have been inconsiderate, the boyfriend's reaction is extreme and possibly not justified. The real issue might be the lack of communication and trust between him and his girlfriend. So, the answer would likely be A (the author is in the wrong) because he's overreacting and violating privacy to end the friendship based on one incident.\n"
