She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a guy who's upset that his girlfriend's friend called another co-worker her \"boyfriend.\" The guy found out through some messages that were deleted but he saw via Fitbit, and then he told his girlfriend not to be friends with her anymore because the friend doesn't respect him or their relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is the boyfriend, and he's taking a pretty strong stance. The friend called someone else the girlfriend's boyfriend, which the author finds offensive. He wants the girlfriend to cut off the friend. But here's the thing: the girlfriend and the friend have been friends for three years. The friend's comment might have been a joke or just a way of referring to a co-worker, maybe not a serious term. The author is acting on a single message where the friend refers to Sam as the boyfriend, which the girlfriend apparently ignored.\n\nNow, is it reasonable to cut off a three-year friendship over one joke? The friend might not have realized how sensitive the author is about this. Also, the girlfriend didn't react to the message at the time, which suggests she didn't take it seriously. The author is using this as a reason to end the friendship, which could be seen as overreacting. Maybe he's being controlling here, especially since he's found out about the messages through a Fitbit, which seems a bit underhanded. Also, the girlfriend deletes messages, but the author is using that as a justification for his actions. \n\nOn the other hand, the author does feel disrespected. If the friend repeatedly made such jokes, maybe cutting off the friendship would be justified. But in this case, it's just one message. The key here is whether the friend's comment was a harmless joke or an actual romantic designation. The author is assuming it's the latter, but that might not be the case. The girlfriend's friend might not mean anything by it, and the author is taking it personally without addressing the issue with the friend first.\n\nAlso, the author's approach is to cut off the friend without giving the friend a chance to explain or apologize. That seems harsh. Instead of cutting off the friend, maybe the girlfriend could have had a conversation with her friend about why that term was inappropriate. By cutting off the friend outright, the author is making a big decision without involving the friend in the resolution. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author might be in the wrong because he's reacting disproportionately to a single message, using underhanded methods to get information, and not giving the friend a chance to address the issue. His actions might be seen as controlling and not respecting his girlfriend's long-standing friendship unless there's a valid reason beyond a single joke.\n"
