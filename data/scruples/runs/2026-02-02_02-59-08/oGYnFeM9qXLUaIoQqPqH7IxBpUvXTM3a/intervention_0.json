She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for cutting off his girlfriend's friend because the friend called another man her \"boyfriend.\" \n\nFirst, the girlfriend and the friend have been colleagues for three years. The friend (let's say the co-worker is female) has been the only person Sam, the other co-worker, interacts with. The author allowed this because he trusted his girlfriend. Then, the girlfriend deleted messages, and the author found out through her Fitbit. The friend used the term \"boyfriend\" to refer to Sam, which the author took seriously.\n\nThe key points here are the author's right to control the relationship's boundaries. The girlfriend's friend called another man her boyfriend, which the author sees as a breach of respect. He's asking if it's wrong to ask his girlfriend to stop being friends with that person. The girlfriend didn't take issue with the term before, just ignored the message. The author is now acting based on that one statement.\n\nI need to consider if the author overreacted. The friend's use of the term might have been a joke or a casual expression, not intended as a real claim. The author is taking control of the relationship by cutting off the friend unilaterally. In healthy relationships, communication is key. The author didn't discuss the issue with his girlfriend but instead decided to end the friendship himself. That could be a problem because it's about respecting each other's autonomy and social circles.\n\nAlso, the fact that the author admitted to going through phones (even if he got the info via Fitbit) suggests a lack of trust, which isn't ideal. The girlfriend might have a right to be friends with someone even if they make a joke. The author's action might be seen as controlling. \n\nSo, the answer is probably A (the author is in the wrong) because he's making a unilateral decision without discussing boundaries with his girlfriend, and the friend's comment might not have been as serious as he's taking it. Plus, the method of finding out through phone checking adds to the issue.\n"
