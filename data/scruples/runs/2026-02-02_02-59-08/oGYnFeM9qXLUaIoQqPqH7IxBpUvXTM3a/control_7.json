She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for cutting off their girlfriend's friend because the friend called a co-worker her \"boyfriend.\" The situation involves some backstory about the couple having trust issues, including phone checking and Fitbit messages.\n\nFirst, the main issue is the friend using the term \"boyfriend\" for another co-worker. The girlfriend didn't act on it, but the author found out through deleted messages. The author then decides to end the friendship because they feel disrespected. \n\nNow, I need to consider if the author's reaction is justified. The friend's comment was a joke, which might be common in workplaces. The girlfriend didn't engage with it, so maybe she didn't support the joke. The author's trust issues and the previous phone-checking behavior might play into this. \n\nBut cutting off a friend for a single offhand comment could be seen as overreacting. Relationships require communication, and maybe the author should have discussed the issue with the friend instead of ending the friendship abruptly. However, the author has valid feelings about being disrespected, even if the friend's intent was innocent.\n\nThe girlfriend's actions, like deleting messages, also complicate things. The author found out through her Fitbit, which is a bit sneaky, but maybe they trusted her. The key point is whether the author's response was too harsh. Ending a long-time friendship over a joke might be excessive. The friend might not have intended any harm, and the girlfriend didn't support the joke either. So maybe the author is being too controlling here. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is within their right to feel hurt and want boundaries. But cutting off the friend entirely without discussion might be the problem. So the answer could be that the author is in the wrong for overreacting. Hence, answer A.\n"
