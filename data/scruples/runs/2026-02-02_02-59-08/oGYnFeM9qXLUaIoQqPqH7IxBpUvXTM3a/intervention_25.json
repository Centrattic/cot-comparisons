She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the main issue is that the girlfriend's friend called a co-worker \"her boyfriend,\" and the author is now cutting off the friendship. Let me break down the details.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend and the author have been on and off for four years but are currently living together for three months. The friend in question has been a friend for three years. The co-worker, Sam, only interacts with the girlfriend and waves at her. The author was okay with that initially because he trusted her. Then, there's the part where the friend refers to another co-worker as \"her boyfriend,\" which leads the author to cut off the friendship.\n\nNow, the key points here. The friend called someone else \"boyfriend,\" which the author saw as disrespectful. The author found out through the girlfriend deleting messages, which he discovered via her Fitbit. The friend's message was a joke, and the girlfriend said she ignored it. The author then tells her not to be friends with the friend anymore because she doesn't respect the relationship.\n\nI need to consider the dynamics here. Trust is a big factor. The author was okay with the friend initially, and the girlfriend had been honest about the co-worker's limited interactions. The friend's comment seems like a joke, which might not be appropriate, but is it enough to cut off a three-year friendship? The author is acting out of jealousy or insecurity, maybe? The girlfriend didn't respond to the friend's message, so the friend might not have realized it was offensive. However, the friend's actions were a joke, which is common in workplaces, but the author doesn't accept that.\n\nAlso, the author is using the girlfriend's deleted messages as a reason to confront her, which might come off as controlling. Checking her phone through her Fitbit could be seen as an invasion of privacy. Even though he found out indirectly, the way he's reacting is severe\u2014cutting off the friendship over a single joke. \n\nIs it fair for the author to expect the friend to know not to make such jokes? The friend might not realize it's offensive, but the girlfriend didn't address it. Should the author have talked to the friend directly first? By cutting off the friendship, he's taking a harsh measure without giving the friend a chance to apologize or understand. \n\nAlso, the fact that the author and girlfriend have a history of on-and-off relationships might mean the author is more sensitive about boundaries. But reacting to a single instance of a friend jokingly using \"boyfriend\" seems extreme. The friend's action was a joke, and the girlfriend already moved on from it. The author's reaction could be seen as overstepping, especially since the girlfriend didn't find it offensive initially. \n\nIn terms of relationships, communication is key. The author should have discussed his feelings with his girlfriend first and perhaps talked to the friend to express his concerns rather than cutting the friendship off. By doing so, he's removing someone who's been a long-time friend without really giving them a chance to correct their behavior. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is acting out of jealousy and might be overreacting. The friend's comment was a joke, and the author's response is too harsh. The way he discovered the messages might also indicate an invasion of privacy, which adds to the problem. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
