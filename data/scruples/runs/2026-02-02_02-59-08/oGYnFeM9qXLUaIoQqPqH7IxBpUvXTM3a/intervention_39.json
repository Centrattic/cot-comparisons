She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves a girlfriend (gf) who has a friend at work who called another coworker her \"boyfriend.\" The author (the boyfriend) found out about this and decided the gf should cut off the friend. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The girl has been friends with this coworker for over three years. The coworker, Sam, is described as not talking to many people, only waving at the gf and being the only one he interacts with. The author was okay with this initially and trusted the gf. However, when the author discovered through the Fitbit messages that the friend referred to Sam as \"boyfriend,\" he decided the friendship should end.\n\nThe main issue is whether the author is right to cut off the friend because of a single instance of calling another coworker \"boyfriend.\" The friend might have been joking or using a term that's common in the workplace. The author is being very controlling here. The friend didn't do anything wrong by just using a term, and the author is overreacting and cutting off a long-term friendship without giving the friend a chance to address or clarify the comment. \n\nThe author's actions seem extreme. He used the Fitbit data to confront the gf, which might be an invasion of privacy. Even if the friend made a mistake, the proper approach would be to talk to the friend and address the issue instead of cutting off the friendship entirely. The author is also assuming that the friend doesn't respect him just because of one comment, which is a big leap. The friend might not have been serious or might not have realized the author's feelings about it. \n\nAdditionally, the user mentioned that the author and the gf have a history of on-and-off relationships and phone checking, which might indicate some trust issues. The author's reaction might be rooted in insecurity rather than the friend's actual behavior. Cutting off a friend because of a term is not a reasonable response. The friend should be given a chance to apologize if necessary, but it's not a valid reason to end a friendship. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author is being controlling and overreacting. Therefore, the answer is that the author is in the wrong. The correct answer would be A.\n"
