She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author is a guy in a relationship with his girlfriend (gf), and she's been friends with a coworker for three years. The coworker, Sam, just waves at her and doesn't talk to others much. The author was okay with it because he trusted her.\n\nThen, the author mentions that they both go through each other's phones. The gf deleted some messages, but the author found out through her Fitbit because the messages there take longer to delete. From there, he found out that the friend called another coworker her \"boyfriend,\" which led the author to say he doesn't want the gf to be friends with her anymore because he feels disrespected.\n\nThe user is asking if the author is the asshole (AITA) for cutting off the friendship. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants another opinion.\n\nFirst, let's consider the key points. The author used the Fitbit to find out the messages after the gf deleted them. Even though the messages were mostly innocent, like asking about clothes, the friend called Sam \"her boyfriend.\" The author then decided to end the friendship because he felt disrespected.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, the friend made a joke about someone else being her boyfriend. It's possible that it was a light-hearted comment without malice. The author didn't see the message directly; he inferred it through the Fitbit. The gf didn't know he found out through the Fitbit, and she might not have intended to hide the friend's comment. She did say she ignored the message and moved on, which suggests she didn't support it. \n\nThe author's reaction is cutting off a friend who has been there for three years. That's a big step. The problem is whether the friend's action was a valid reason. Calling someone a \"work boyfriend\" or \"boyfriend\" might be common in workplaces as a joke. The author might be overreacting. Also, the author's method of finding out (using Fitbit) might be a bit underhanded, which could affect trust in the relationship. But the user says not to focus on the phone part. \n\nThe author's main argument is that the friend doesn't respect him as the boyfriend. But the friend might not have known that the author was the actual boyfriend. The gf didn't correct the friend when she called Sam that. However, the author could have approached the situation differently, like talking to the friend directly or discussing it with his gf about boundaries instead of cutting off the friendship entirely. \n\nOn the other hand, the author has the right to feel disrespected if someone refers to another man as his girlfriend's boyfriend. But the context is a workplace joke. It's possible the friend didn't mean any harm. The author's reaction is extreme because the friend is a long-time friend. Ending the friendship without addressing it might be a mistake. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author's actions seem a bit harsh. He might be overreacting to a joke that wasn't necessarily meant to be offensive. Cutting off a friend because of a single comment, especially when the gf didn't support the joke, could be seen as the author being too controlling or not giving the friend a chance to explain. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
