She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person posting) is in the wrong for cutting off his girlfriend's friend because the friend called another coworker her \"boyfriend\". \n\nFirst, the situation: The girlfriend has been friends with this coworker for over three years. The author is upset because the friend referred to another guy, Sam, as her \"boyfriend\", even though that's not the case. The author found out through deleted messages (which he discovered via a Fitbit) and then decided to end the friendship.\n\nNow, the key points here. The friend called Sam \"boyfriend\" as a joke or maybe a term of endearment? The girlfriend says she ignored the message and moved on. The author feels disrespected and doesn't want the friendship anymore. \n\nIs the author overreacting? The friend's comment could be seen as a harmless joke, especially in a workplace where people sometimes use such terms. The girlfriend didn't engage with it, so maybe she didn't endorse it. The author, however, is cutting off the friend solely based on that one comment. That seems extreme. Friendship issues should be discussed with the friend first, not automatically ended. Also, the author is using a deleted message as a reason, which he found through a third-party device (Fitbit), which might not even be a reliable method. The girlfriend didn't know he was reading her Fitbit messages, which could be an invasion of privacy in itself.\n\nAnother angle: The author is controlling his girlfriend's friendships, which can be a sign of jealousy or lack of trust. Healthy relationships allow both partners to have friends, especially if those friends have been around for a long time. Ending a friendship because of a joke might not be justified unless the behavior is abusive or malicious. \n\nBut the author's argument is that the friend doesn't respect him as the boyfriend. However, a single comment doesn't necessarily show disrespect. The girlfriend might have had a chance to address it with the friend already. The author's decision to cut off the friend without talking to them first could be seen as harsh. \n\nConsidering all this, the author is acting on a minor issue and making a significant decision without addressing the friend directly. That's probably where he's wrong. So the answer is A.\n"
