She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not allowing his girlfriend to be friends with her coworker after the coworker called another coworker \"her boyfriend\" as a joke.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The girlfriend has been friends with this coworker (let's say she's the one who called Sam the boyfriend). The boyfriend found out through the Fitbit messages that the friend joked about Sam being the girlfriend's boyfriend. The boyfriend then told his girlfriend to stop being friends with her because he doesn't think the friend respects their relationship.\n\nNow, the main points to consider are: Is the boyfriend overreacting? Does the friend's comment cross a line? Should the girlfriend have addressed it before the boyfriend had to step in? Also, the boyfriend used the Fitbit to check messages the girlfriend deleted, which might be an issue of privacy invasion.\n\nThe girlfriend's friend made a joke by calling another man her boyfriend, which the girlfriend didn't address. The boyfriend is upset because he doesn't accept work relationships or jokes about them. He's cutting off the friend entirely. Is that a reasonable response?\n\nFrom a relationship perspective, communication is key. If the girlfriend didn't address the friend's joke and the boyfriend felt it was necessary to intervene, there might be a breakdown in communication between the couple. Also, the boyfriend's method of finding out (using the Fitbit) could be problematic. Even if the friend's comment was inappropriate, cutting off the friend entirely might be too harsh, especially since the friend didn't know the boyfriend's stance on such jokes.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend has the right to feel uncomfortable with the joke, especially if he and the girlfriend have discussed boundaries. However, the appropriate response would be discussing boundaries with the girlfriend and maybe the friend, not cutting off the friendship entirely without the girlfriend's input.\n\nSo, the boyfriend's actions might be considered overstepping because he's making a decision for the girlfriend about her friendships based on a joke that he himself found out through invasive means. The girlfriend might need to have a conversation with the friend, but the boyfriend shouldn't unilaterally decide to end the friendship without discussing it with her.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because he's cutting off the friend without proper communication and using invasive methods to monitor his girlfriend's phone.\n"
