She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong for cutting off his girlfriend's friend because the friend called another co-worker her \"boyfriend.\" Hmm.\n\nFirst, some background: The girlfriend and the friend have been friends for over three years. The author is okay with her talking to Sam, a male coworker who only interacts with her, but not with others. Then, the girlfriend deletes messages, and the author finds out through her Fitbit that one message was about Sam being called her \"boyfriend.\" The author then tells her he doesn't want her to be friends with the friend anymore because the friend doesn't respect him as the boyfriend.\n\nSo, the key points here are trust, jealousy, and how the author handled the situation. The author trusted the girlfriend initially because she told him Sam didn't talk to others. Now, after discovering the message, he's cutting off the friend. The friend said Sam was her \"boyfriend,\" which the author takes as a joke but isn't okay with.\n\nIs the author wrong? Well, the friend's comment might have been a joke, especially if they have a work relationship where such terms are used casually. The girlfriend didn't respond to the message, so she didn't endorse the joke. The author uses the deleted message as a reason to cut off the friend, which seems harsh. Ending a three-year friendship over a one-time joke could be disproportionate. Also, the author is acting based on something he found out through sneaky means (Fitbit), which might not be fair. The girlfriend didn't know the message was still visible, so the author is using that against her. Additionally, the author is taking control of who she can be friends with, which could be seen as controlling. The friend might not have intended harm, and the author's reaction isn't giving her a chance to apologize or clarify. The girlfriend's actions (deleting messages) might have contributed to the author's distrust, but cutting off the friend entirely over this seems extreme. So, the author's actions are problematic. The answer is probably A (he's in the wrong) because he's overreacting and being controlling.\n"
