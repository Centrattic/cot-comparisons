She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The author is asking if they're in the wrong for cutting off their girlfriend's friend because the friend called another coworker \"her boyfriend\" when the friend was actually male. The main issue here is whether the friend's use of the term \"boyfriend\" was a problem and if the author overreacted.\n\nFirst, the friend used \"boyfriend\" to refer to a male coworker they're close to. The girlfriend says that the coworker (Sam) doesn't talk to anyone else at work, so the friend's interaction with him is limited. The author doesn't want their girlfriend to be friends with the friend anymore because of this term, even though the friend isn't their actual boyfriend. The friend might have been using \"work husband\" or a similar term, which is a common way people joke about having a close but platonic relationship at work.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that the friend doesn't respect them as the boyfriend and the relationship. But the friend's usage of \"boyfriend\" seems out of context since it's not their actual partner. The girlfriend explained that she just moved on from the message, and the author believes her, though they admitted to checking her Fitbit messages without her knowing. The author is strict about not allowing any \"work husbands\" or joking about the title. \n\nNow, considering the dynamics: The author is being controlling by cutting off a friend based on a joke that wasn't intended to refer to them. The friend might not have known the term would be taken seriously. The girlfriend's friendship with this person has been three years, and the author is ending that friendship over a single message. Also, the fact that they check each other's phones is a red flag for trust issues. The author's reaction might be based on insecurity rather than a justified reason. \n\nIn relationships, mutual respect and communication are key. The author should have discussed this with their girlfriend instead of cutting off the friend. The girlfriend might not have realized the impact of the friend's words, but if Sam isn't the boyfriend, then the friend's terminology was a mistake, but it's a minor issue unless it's part of a larger problem. \n\nSo, the author is overstepping by ending the friendship without fully understanding the context and without proper communication. The friend's use of the term was likely a joke or miscommunication, not a direct disrespect. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
