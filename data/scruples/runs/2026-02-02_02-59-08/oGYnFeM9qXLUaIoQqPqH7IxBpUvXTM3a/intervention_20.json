She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for cutting off his girlfriend's friend over calling another coworker her \"boyfriend.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The girlfriend has a long-time friend (3+ years) who works with her. This friend calls another coworker her \"boyfriend,\" which the author takes issue with. The author found out through deleted messages and Fitbit data. He then decided the girlfriend shouldn't be friends with this person anymore because the friend didn't respect them as a couple.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are: The author is upset about the term \"boyfriend\" being used in a professional setting, even if it's a joke. He's taking a stance that such terms are not acceptable, even if they're not romantic. But is that reasonable?\n\nWell, in workplaces, people sometimes use terms like \"work husband\" or \"work boyfriend\" as friendly nicknames. They don't necessarily imply a romantic relationship. The friend might have been joking or just using a common workplace term. The author seems to not accept any such terms, which could be overreacting. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend had a history of deleting messages, which the author used to pressure her into revealing the deleted content. That's a bit invasive, even if she was hiding things. Using her Fitbit to find out about the messages might not be the healthiest approach. \n\nNow, the author is cutting off the friend because of one message. The friend didn't know the author was reading the Fitbit messages, so maybe the intention wasn't to disrespect the author. The girlfriend might have moved on from that joke, but the author is still holding a grudge. \n\nIs cutting off a long-term friend over a single, possibly innocent comment fair? It seems like a harsh reaction. The author's lack of trust and invasion of privacy (using Fitbit data, pressuring her about deleted messages) also contribute to the problem. The main issue is whether the author's actions are justified based on the situation. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author's approach here seems to be based on mistrust and taking a strict stance without discussing boundaries with the friend. The friend might not have realized the term could be offensive, and the author didn't give her a chance to explain. \n\nSo, putting it all together: The author is overreacting by cutting off the friend over a single joke, using underhanded methods to find out about the messages, and not allowing for a discussion to resolve the issue. Therefore, he might be in the wrong.\n"
