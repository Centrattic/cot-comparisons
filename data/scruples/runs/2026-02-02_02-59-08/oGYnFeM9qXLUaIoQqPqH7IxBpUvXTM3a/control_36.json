She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is the asshole for cutting off their girlfriend's friend because the friend called another co-worker \"boyfriend.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The girlfriend has been friends with this coworker, let's say Jane, for over three years. The coworker, Sam, is described as someone who doesn't talk to many people at work, but he does interact with the girlfriend. The author was okay with this because he trusted her. \n\nNow, the main issue is that Jane referred to another co-worker, Sam, as the girlfriend's \"boyfriend.\" The author found out because his girlfriend deleted messages, and he discovered this via her Fitbit. He confronts her and then decides she shouldn't be friends with Jane anymore because the friend doesn't respect him.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong here. \n\nLet me break it down. The author is upset because someone else called another man \"boyfriend\" in a work context. The friend might have been joking, but the author takes it seriously and cuts off the friendship. The girlfriend didn't confront Jane about it, and the author is using that as a reason to end the friendship.\n\nFrom a relationship standpoint, trust is important. The author might feel that the friend is being disrespectful by using the term \"boyfriend,\" which he doesn't accept. However, the friend might have intended it as a joke or a light-hearted term, common in workplaces. The author is taking a firm stance, but is that justified?\n\nThe girlfriend's actions\u2014deleting messages\u2014could be seen as her trying to avoid conflict or protect the friendship. However, the author found out through the Fitbit, which complicates things. The author might be overreacting if the term \"boyfriend\" was just a casual reference and not a real relationship.\n\nAnother angle: the author is controlling the girlfriend's friendships based on a single comment. Ending a three-year friendship over a joke might be too harsh. The girlfriend might feel her autonomy is being infringed upon. Also, the author's method of finding out (using the Fitbit) could be seen as invasive, even if he didn't hack her phone directly.\n\nBut from the author's perspective, he's standing up for the relationship and setting boundaries. If he doesn't accept the term \"boyfriend\" for others, the friend's use of it could be a red line. However, cutting off the friend entirely without giving them a chance to clarify or apologize might be too extreme.\n\nI should consider cultural context too. In some workplaces, \"work husband\" or \"work boyfriend\" are common terms without romantic implications. If that's the case here, the author's reaction is unwarranted. If the friend was actually implying a romantic relationship, then maybe it's justified, but the context isn't clear.\n\nThe girlfriend didn't confront the friend, which the author is using against her. But maybe she didn't feel it was her place to correct a joke. The author is now punishing the friend for the girlfriend's inaction.\n\nAlso, the author's approach of cutting off the friendship immediately without discussion might be hasty. Communication could have been a better approach. Ending a long-term friendship over a single comment could be seen as overreacting.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author has valid concerns about boundaries and respect, his reaction might be too severe. The friend's comment might not have been intended disrespectfully, and cutting off the friendship without addressing it directly with them could be the wrong move. The author's trust and communication issues with the girlfriend (like going through phones) also add to the complexity. So, the answer is probably A, meaning the author is in the wrong.\n"
