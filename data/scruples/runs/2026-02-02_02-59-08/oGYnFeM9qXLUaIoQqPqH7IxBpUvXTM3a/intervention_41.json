She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is wrong for cutting off his girlfriend's friend because the friend called another coworker \"boyfriend.\" The girlfriend has been friends with this person for three years, and the author found out through deleted messages and her Fitbit. He then decides she shouldn't be friends with her anymore because the friend didn't respect him as the boyfriend.\n\nFirst, the issue is about the friend's comment. The friend referred to another coworker as \"boyfriend,\" which the author finds offensive. But the friend isn't the author's partner; the coworker is the one being labeled. The author is upset that the friend used that term, which could be a joke or a slip. However, the key here is that the author is cutting off the friend based on one message. \n\nThe girlfriend tried to deflect by deleting messages, which the author discovered through the Fitbit. That part might be a red flag in terms of trust, but the main issue is the friend's comment. The author is taking a strict stance, not allowing the friend to continue the relationship because of a single instance. \n\nIs it reasonable to end a long-term friendship over a joke? The author might be overreacting. The friend's comment doesn't necessarily indicate disrespect towards the author; it could just be a work joke. The girlfriend didn't engage with the message, so maybe she addressed it. The author's reaction seems harsh, especially since the friend might not have intended malice. \n\nAlso, the author is using the Fitbit to monitor messages, which isn't a healthy way to handle trust issues. The decision to cut off the friend without giving her a chance to explain or apologize might be too extreme. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong for overreacting and not allowing the friend to clarify or apologize. The answer is A.\n"
