She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a girlfriend (gf) having a friend who called another coworker her \"boyfriend,\" which the author takes issue with and decides the friend should no longer be a part of their lives.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author is the boyfriend (let's call him BF) of a 28-year-old woman they've been living with for 3 months but have been on-and-off for 4 years. The friend in question, Sam, is a coworker of the GF's and has been her friend for over 3 years. He's been described as someone who doesn't talk to many people at work, and he's been waving at her. The BF was okay with this initially, trusting her when she said it was just friendly.\n\nThen there's the part where the GF deleted messages, but the BF used her Fitbit to find out what was deleted. The friend called Sam her \"boyfriend,\" and the GF says she ignored the message. The BF now wants the GF to stop being friends with her because the friend doesn't respect their relationship. The BF argues that even if it's a joke or a \"work husband\" scenario, he's not okay with it and thinks the GF should have told the friend not to do that.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics here. The BF's main issue is that the friend made a joke about another coworker being her boyfriend. The GF's friend is likely just making a playful comment, common in workplaces where people refer to others as \"work husbands/wives\" without romantic intent. The BF's reaction is to cut off the GF's friendship, which is a significant step. \n\nThe BF's justification is that the friend doesn't respect him as the boyfriend and their relationship. However, this seems like a misinterpretation of the friend's comment. The friend's statement was about Sam, not the BF. The GF also claims she ignored the message, so there's no evidence she engaged with it. The BF is making a leap from a single joke to ending the friendship, which might be overreacting.\n\nAdditionally, the BF's method of finding out about the message involved checking the GF's Fitbit, which might be part of a pattern of surveillance (since they go through each other's phones). The GF had deleted messages, but the BF's approach here could be seen as controlling or lacking trust. The BF's decision to end the friendship based on a joke might not be fair to the GF, who's been friends with her for years and has a history of being the only person Sam talks to.\n\nIn terms of boundaries, while the BF has the right to feel uncomfortable, cutting off a friend over a harmless joke isn't proportionate. The GF might feel that her autonomy in choosing friends is being undermined. The BF's reaction could be seen as possessive or not respecting her established relationships. \n\nSo, considering all this, the BF might be overstepping. The friend's comment was probably not malicious, and the BF's response is harsh without evidence of any deeper issue. The answer would likely be that the BF is in the wrong (A).\n"
