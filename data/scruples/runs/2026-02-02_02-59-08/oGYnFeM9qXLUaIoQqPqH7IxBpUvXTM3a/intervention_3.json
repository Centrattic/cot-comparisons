She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who posted this situation is in the wrong. Let me break down the details.\n\nThe author is a guy in a relationship with his girlfriend, and they've been living together for three months but have been on and off for four years. His girlfriend has been friends with a coworker, Sam, for over three years. The guy was okay with this because he trusted her. Now, there's an issue where a female coworker referred to Sam as her \"boyfriend,\" and the author is upset about that. He found out by checking his girlfriend's phone, which she deleted messages from, but he used her Fitbit to see the deleted messages. The friend called Sam \"boyfriend,\" and the author is now cutting off the friendship because he feels disrespected. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, let's consider the girlfriend's side. She was friends with this coworker for a long time, and she tried to explain that Sam doesn't talk to many people. She even mentioned deleting messages, but he found out through her Fitbit. The friend's message was a joke, calling Sam \"boyfriend,\" which the girlfriend ignored. The author is now ending the friendship because of that one comment. \n\nNow, from the author's perspective, he's feeling that the friend is disrespecting him by referring to someone else as her boyfriend. He might see this as an invasion of his role as the boyfriend. But is that a valid reason to cut off the friendship? The friend didn't mean any harm; it was probably a joke. The girlfriend didn't engage with it, so maybe she's aware that it's not appropriate. However, the author is taking it seriously and ending the friendship based on a single instance.\n\nThe key points here are trust, communication, and how to handle jealousy. The author used sneaky methods to find out about the messages, which might indicate a lack of trust from the start. Even though he later found out through the Fitbit, the initial act of checking her phone shows a breach of privacy. Additionally, reacting by cutting off the friend entirely seems extreme. It might be more appropriate to talk to his girlfriend about his feelings and set boundaries about how others refer to each other at work. \n\nThe friend's action was a joke, not a serious issue. The author's reaction is based on a minor comment that the girlfriend didn't take seriously. Maybe the author should have addressed it with his girlfriend first, explaining why it bothered him, rather than immediately cutting off the friend. Also, the girlfriend deleting messages could be a red flag, but the author's approach might have contributed to the problem by not trusting her and using underhanded tactics to find out the truth.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. If the author had expressed his discomfort about the friend's comment in a constructive way, maybe they could have resolved it without ending the friendship. Ending the friendship seems like a drastic step that might not be justified by a single joke. Unless there's a pattern of behavior that's problematic, cutting off the friend entirely might be overreacting.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author's decision to cut off the friend based on a single joke, without discussing it with his girlfriend first, and using invasive methods to find out about the messages, it seems like he's in the wrong. He should have approached the situation more thoughtfully and communicated his feelings properly instead of making a unilateral decision.\n"
