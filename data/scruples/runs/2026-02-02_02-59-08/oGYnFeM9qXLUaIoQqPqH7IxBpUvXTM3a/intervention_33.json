She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a girlfriend and her co-worker friend who's been around for three years. The author finds out that this co-worker friend referred to another colleague as her \"boyfriend\" and now the author is cutting off the friendship. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The girlfriend and the friend have been friends for over three years. The author is okay with the friend waving and being the only person the co-worker talks to. The problem arises when the friend calls another guy (Sam) her \"boyfriend.\" The author discovers this through the girlfriend's deleted messages, which he found out via her Fitbit. The author then tells the girlfriend to end the friendship because the friend doesn't respect him as the boyfriend.\n\nNow, considering jealousy and trust issues. The author is acting out of jealousy, which is a common issue in relationships. However, the appropriateness of cutting off a friend based on one joke is debatable. The friend might have been just making a joke, which the girlfriend even tried to move past. The author is taking a very strict stance, not allowing any kind of \"work husband\" relationships. \n\nIs it reasonable? Well, if the author has communicated his boundaries clearly beforehand, maybe. But in this case, the girlfriend didn't know the author was against such terms. She might have thought it was a harmless joke. Also, the way the author found out (through deleted messages and the Fitbit) might indicate that he's already in a controlling mindset, which could contribute to the issue.\n\nAnother angle: the friend's comment was about another guy, not the author's girlfriend's actual boyfriend. The friend might not have intended any harm and just used a term that's common in workplaces. The author is overreacting and using that as a reason to end a long-term friendship. That could be seen as a bit harsh, especially if there's no prior history of such issues.\n\nAlso, the girlfriend tried to deflect the conversation after the friend called Sam her boyfriend. The author is now holding that against her and the friend. Maybe the friend didn't realize the author's feelings about the term. The author should have discussed his feelings with both his girlfriend and her friend first before cutting them off.\n\nIn terms of relationships, communication is key. Instead of immediately cutting off the friend, the author could have talked to his girlfriend about his discomfort with the term and asked her to address it with her friend. If the friend was aware and still used it, then maybe the author has a case. But if it was a one-time joke and the friend had no malice, cutting off the friendship seems extreme.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author's reaction is impulsive and possibly controlling. He's using a minor issue to end a significant friendship without trying to resolve it through communication. That makes him the asshole here, so the answer would be A.\n"
