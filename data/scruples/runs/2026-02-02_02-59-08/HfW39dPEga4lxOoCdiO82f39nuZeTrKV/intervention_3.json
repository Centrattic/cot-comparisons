My son wont even talk to me and my daughter is crying all the time. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA little backstory. Me and my ex divorced shortly after my daughter was born. I blame him for it and he blames me. I won't go into detail here. We ended up with a 50/50 custody agreement switching every other week. While this was 8 years ago we're still not on good terms. We rarely ever talk to each other outside of the kids and i'm perfectly fine with that. One thing we have agreed on since the beginning though is that we don't plan things on days that aren't ours. And unless it's extremely important we don't \"switch\" days or weeks. In the 8 years since we've been divorced I have never asked him to have the kids on a day that isn't mine and I've never given him one of my days even if he begged. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, last week my ex contacted me and told me the \"good\" news. His parents are hosting a week long family reunion in the summer at Disneyland and he want's to take the kids. Well, the problem is that it's on one of my weeks. He asked me to let the kids stay with him that week or to switch a week with me and I shot him down. It's my week with them and I get to spend it with them. I told him if it's so important to him to reschedule but he claims his parents can't do that and this is the only week that the whole family can go and he told me that I need to \"think of them\". I told him \"tough luck\" and hung up on him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this last Sunday when my ex dropped the kids off with me my son refused to talk to me at all and my daughter wouldn't even look at me. When I asked my ex what was wrong he refused to talk to me, only saying \"ask them\" in a snarky tone before leaving. When I asked my daughter what was wrong she burst into tears and said that i was \"not letting daddy take them to Disneyland\". Asking my son (who still refuses to talk to me) it turns out that my ex told them I was not letting them go to Disneyland with him. He's trying to paint me as the bad guy. I sat both of them down last night to talk to them and explain it's my week with them but they refused to listen to me. My daughter just cried and my son told me i'm only doing this to get back at my ex.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm not though. I think its unfair for him to do this when his parents scheduled it during my time with them. I demanded an apology from my ex and him to set things straight but he refuses, and his last text to me being \"can't tell them the truth cause they already know it\". \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm so pissed right now. Am i the asshole because my ex scheduled something during MY time with MY kids? How is it my fault that i'm only using my right to spend time with them? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about custody and the parent not allowing their kids to go on a vacation with the ex during the parent's scheduled time.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the setup. The parents have a 50/50 custody arrangement, switching every other week. They agreed not to plan things on each other's days unless it's extremely important. The ex wants to take the kids to Disneyland during the author's week, so the author refuses. Now the kids are upset, blaming the author, and the ex isn't helping but is making the author look bad.\n\nThe author's main point is that it's their time with the kids, so they shouldn't have to give it up. The ex is trying to schedule something during their time, which the author sees as unfair. The kids are upset because they think the author is denying them the vacation, but the author feels it's their right to have the kids during their scheduled week.\n\nNow, considering custody agreements, typically the non-custodial parent can't just take the kids during the custodial parent's scheduled time without an agreement. But in a 50/50 split, maybe the rules are a bit different. However, the key here is that they have an existing agreement not to switch weeks unless it's extremely important. The ex is asking to switch this time, but the author says no.\n\nThe author did explain the situation to the kids, but the kids are taking the ex's side. The author might be seen as strict, not wanting to bend for the kids' wishes. On the other hand, the ex is possibly violating the agreement by scheduling something during the other parent's time. The author's refusal is based on the agreement they both had, so maybe they're in the right. However, the author's approach\u2014telling the ex \"tough luck\" and hanging up\u2014might be seen as harsh, but the core issue is the custody agreement.\n\nThe kids are upset because they want to go on vacation, but the author is standing by their agreement. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for enforcing the agreement. If the agreement was clear, the author isn't in the wrong. But maybe there's a nuance where the ex's request is considered important enough to bend the rules. However, the author's stance is that the ex should have rescheduled, which the ex claims isn't possible.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, sometimes the parent's strictness is seen as the problem, especially if the kids are significantly upset. But the author's argument is about upholding the agreement. The ex might be the one flouting the agreement, so the author isn't in the wrong for refusing. However, the way the author handled the situation (snapping at the ex) might affect the judgment. But the main issue is the custody time. So, the answer might be B, not in the wrong.\n"
