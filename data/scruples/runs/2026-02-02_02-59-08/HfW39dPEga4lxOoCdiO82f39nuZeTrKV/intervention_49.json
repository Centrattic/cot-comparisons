My son wont even talk to me and my daughter is crying all the time. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA little backstory. Me and my ex divorced shortly after my daughter was born. I blame him for it and he blames me. I won't go into detail here. We ended up with a 50/50 custody agreement switching every other week. While this was 8 years ago we're still not on good terms. We rarely ever talk to each other outside of the kids and i'm perfectly fine with that. One thing we have agreed on since the beginning though is that we don't plan things on days that aren't ours. And unless it's extremely important we don't \"switch\" days or weeks. In the 8 years since we've been divorced I have never asked him to have the kids on a day that isn't mine and I've never given him one of my days even if he begged. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, last week my ex contacted me and told me the \"good\" news. His parents are hosting a week long family reunion in the summer at Disneyland and he want's to take the kids. Well, the problem is that it's on one of my weeks. He asked me to let the kids stay with him that week or to switch a week with me and I shot him down. It's my week with them and I get to spend it with them. I told him if it's so important to him to reschedule but he claims his parents can't do that and this is the only week that the whole family can go and he told me that I need to \"think of them\". I told him \"tough luck\" and hung up on him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this last Sunday when my ex dropped the kids off with me my son refused to talk to me at all and my daughter wouldn't even look at me. When I asked my ex what was wrong he refused to talk to me, only saying \"ask them\" in a snarky tone before leaving. When I asked my daughter what was wrong she burst into tears and said that i was \"not letting daddy take them to Disneyland\". Asking my son (who still refuses to talk to me) it turns out that my ex told them I was not letting them go to Disneyland with him. He's trying to paint me as the bad guy. I sat both of them down last night to talk to them and explain it's my week with them but they refused to listen to me. My daughter just cried and my son told me i'm only doing this to get back at my ex.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm not though. I think its unfair for him to do this when his parents scheduled it during my time with them. I demanded an apology from my ex and him to set things straight but he refuses, and his last text to me being \"can't tell them the truth cause they already know it\". \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm so pissed right now. Am i the asshole because my ex scheduled something during MY time with MY kids? How is it my fault that i'm only using my right to spend time with them? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is a parent who has a 50/50 custody arrangement with their ex, switching every other week. They mention that they've never switched days unless it's extremely important. Now, the ex wants to take the kids to Disneyland for a week-long family reunion during the author's custody week. The author refused to switch weeks or let the ex have the kids that week. The kids are upset because they think the author is preventing them from going on vacation with their dad. The ex is portrayed as the one who scheduled the event during the author's time, and the author is standing by their decision to keep the kids that week.\n\nThe key points here are the custody agreement and the communication (or lack thereof) with the kids. The author has been strict about not switching weeks unless it's extremely important. The ex's parents had the event scheduled during the author's week, and the ex is now trying to get the kids to see the author as the villain. The author is upset that the kids are upset and that the ex isn't letting them know the truth.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the custody agreement. If it's a 50/50 split and they've agreed to not switch unless necessary, then the author has the legal right to have the kids during their scheduled week. The ex's request to switch would require both parents' agreement, but the author is refusing because they didn't plan anything on their own time. So legally, the author isn't in the wrong here.\n\nHowever, the kids are confused and upset. The author didn't communicate with them about the situation, leading the ex to inform them in a way that made the author look bad. The author should have explained the situation to the kids themselves, rather than letting the ex do it. That could be a mistake in communication. The author's refusal to switch is justified based on the agreement, but the way they handled the kids' understanding of the situation might be at fault.\n\nAnother angle is that the ex might be using the kids to get back at the author, but the author's stance is that they're just following the custody agreement. The author is also frustrated that the ex isn't being honest with the kids. However, the author's decision to hang up and say \"tough luck\" could be seen as harsh, especially if they didn't consider the kids' feelings first.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author isn't violating the custody agreement, so they aren't legally at fault. The moral question is whether they should have been more flexible for the kids' benefit. The ex scheduled the event during the author's week, but if the ex had planned it earlier to accommodate the schedule, maybe the situation could have been avoided. However, the author is within their rights to stick to the schedule.\n\nThe main issue here is the communication with the kids. The author didn't discuss the situation with them, leading to confusion and resentment. The author's approach might be legally sound but emotionally harmful to the kids. However, the ex is also at fault for manipulating the situation and not being transparent.\n\nSo, considering all that, is the author in the wrong? They followed the custody agreement, but maybe they could have handled the communication better. The answer could be that the author is not in the wrong (B) because they adhered to the custody terms, but their handling of the kids' emotions might be a separate issue. Alternatively, if the focus is on the kids' well-being, the author might be at fault for not considering their feelings. However, the ex's actions are also problematic. The question is whether the author's refusal to switch weeks is wrong. Since the agreement was to not switch unless necessary, the author isn't in the wrong. The ex's bad communication is the main issue here. Therefore, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
