My son wont even talk to me and my daughter is crying all the time. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA little backstory. Me and my ex divorced shortly after my daughter was born. I blame him for it and he blames me. I won't go into detail here. We ended up with a 50/50 custody agreement switching every other week. While this was 8 years ago we're still not on good terms. We rarely ever talk to each other outside of the kids and i'm perfectly fine with that. One thing we have agreed on since the beginning though is that we don't plan things on days that aren't ours. And unless it's extremely important we don't \"switch\" days or weeks. In the 8 years since we've been divorced I have never asked him to have the kids on a day that isn't mine and I've never given him one of my days even if he begged. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, last week my ex contacted me and told me the \"good\" news. His parents are hosting a week long family reunion in the summer at Disneyland and he want's to take the kids. Well, the problem is that it's on one of my weeks. He asked me to let the kids stay with him that week or to switch a week with me and I shot him down. It's my week with them and I get to spend it with them. I told him if it's so important to him to reschedule but he claims his parents can't do that and this is the only week that the whole family can go and he told me that I need to \"think of them\". I told him \"tough luck\" and hung up on him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this last Sunday when my ex dropped the kids off with me my son refused to talk to me at all and my daughter wouldn't even look at me. When I asked my ex what was wrong he refused to talk to me, only saying \"ask them\" in a snarky tone before leaving. When I asked my daughter what was wrong she burst into tears and said that i was \"not letting daddy take them to Disneyland\". Asking my son (who still refuses to talk to me) it turns out that my ex told them I was not letting them go to Disneyland with him. He's trying to paint me as the bad guy. I sat both of them down last night to talk to them and explain it's my week with them but they refused to listen to me. My daughter just cried and my son told me i'm only doing this to get back at my ex.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm not though. I think its unfair for him to do this when his parents scheduled it during my time with them. I demanded an apology from my ex and him to set things straight but he refuses, and his last text to me being \"can't tell them the truth cause they already know it\". \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm so pissed right now. Am i the asshole because my ex scheduled something during MY time with MY kids? How is it my fault that i'm only using my right to spend time with them? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a custody dispute where the parents are supposed to have 50/50 custody, switching every other week. The author is refusing to let the kids go with their ex on their scheduled week to attend a family reunion at Disneyland.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that they both agreed not to plan things on days that aren't theirs unless it's extremely important. They haven't switched days in 8 years, and the author has never given up their time before. The ex is asking to switch weeks, but the author says no. The kids are upset because they think the author is blocking them from going. The ex is using emotional manipulation, making the kids feel like the author is the bad guy.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that it's their time with the kids, so they should have the right to spend it with them. The ex's parents can't reschedule, and the author isn't willing to switch weeks. The kids are upset, with the daughter crying and the son not talking. The author is frustrated that the ex isn't being fair and is trying to frame them.\n\nNow, considering custody agreements, the 50/50 split is supposed to be structured so each parent has set time. If the ex wants to use time that's scheduled to the other parent, they need mutual agreement. The author is standing by their own time, which is their right. However, maybe the author could have considered the kids' feelings and found a compromise, but the ex also isn't helping by making the kids feel like the author is the villain.\n\nThe key points: The author isn't violating the agreement by not switching. The ex is asking for a switch during the author's time, which the author is within their rights to refuse. The ex is not respecting the agreement by pushing for the switch without valid reason. The author's refusal isn't malicious, but perhaps the way they handled it (like hanging up) might be seen as harsh. However, the main issue is the ex's actions in manipulating the kids and not following the agreed structure.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for not letting the kids go during their scheduled time. The ex is the one trying to bend the rules. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
