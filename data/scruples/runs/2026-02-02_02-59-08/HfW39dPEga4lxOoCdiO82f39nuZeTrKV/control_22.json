My son wont even talk to me and my daughter is crying all the time. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA little backstory. Me and my ex divorced shortly after my daughter was born. I blame him for it and he blames me. I won't go into detail here. We ended up with a 50/50 custody agreement switching every other week. While this was 8 years ago we're still not on good terms. We rarely ever talk to each other outside of the kids and i'm perfectly fine with that. One thing we have agreed on since the beginning though is that we don't plan things on days that aren't ours. And unless it's extremely important we don't \"switch\" days or weeks. In the 8 years since we've been divorced I have never asked him to have the kids on a day that isn't mine and I've never given him one of my days even if he begged. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, last week my ex contacted me and told me the \"good\" news. His parents are hosting a week long family reunion in the summer at Disneyland and he want's to take the kids. Well, the problem is that it's on one of my weeks. He asked me to let the kids stay with him that week or to switch a week with me and I shot him down. It's my week with them and I get to spend it with them. I told him if it's so important to him to reschedule but he claims his parents can't do that and this is the only week that the whole family can go and he told me that I need to \"think of them\". I told him \"tough luck\" and hung up on him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this last Sunday when my ex dropped the kids off with me my son refused to talk to me at all and my daughter wouldn't even look at me. When I asked my ex what was wrong he refused to talk to me, only saying \"ask them\" in a snarky tone before leaving. When I asked my daughter what was wrong she burst into tears and said that i was \"not letting daddy take them to Disneyland\". Asking my son (who still refuses to talk to me) it turns out that my ex told them I was not letting them go to Disneyland with him. He's trying to paint me as the bad guy. I sat both of them down last night to talk to them and explain it's my week with them but they refused to listen to me. My daughter just cried and my son told me i'm only doing this to get back at my ex.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm not though. I think its unfair for him to do this when his parents scheduled it during my time with them. I demanded an apology from my ex and him to set things straight but he refuses, and his last text to me being \"can't tell them the truth cause they already know it\". \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm so pissed right now. Am i the asshole because my ex scheduled something during MY time with MY kids? How is it my fault that i'm only using my right to spend time with them? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about a parent deciding not to switch custody weeks so their kids can go to Disneyland with the ex during the parent's scheduled time. The ex is upset, as are the kids, with the son not talking and the daughter crying. The author's reasoning is that the custody schedule is strict and they've never given up time before. They feel it's unfair the ex scheduled the family reunion during their week.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. If they have a 50/50 custody agreement that's legally binding, the author is within their rights to enforce it. The ex's request to switch weeks would require mutual agreement, and if the author isn't willing, they can't be forced. But maybe there's a clause in the agreement about holidays or family events? The user doesn't mention that, so assuming the agreement is strictly every other week without exceptions unless both agree.\n\nNext, the emotional impact on the kids. The daughter is young (9) and might not understand the custody arrangement as well as the older son. If the ex is using the situation to make the kids upset and turn them against the author, that's a problem. The author is trying to maintain their scheduled time, which is important for co-parenting, but they might not have considered the kids' feelings. Explaining the situation to the kids could help, but if the ex is framing the author as the bad guy, that's a manipulation tactic. The author's approach of saying \"tough luck\" might come off as harsh, especially to a child. Maybe they could have been more empathetic while still standing by the custody schedule.\n\nThe ex's responsibility. Since the ex's parents scheduled the reunion during the author's custody week, the onus might be on the ex to coordinate with the author first. The ex should have approached the author earlier to discuss and find a compromise, rather than making unilateral decisions. However, the ex might argue that it's a once-in-a-lifetime event for the kids. But the author's consistency in not giving up time before suggests they've been respectful of the agreement, so this might not be a valid reason to break it now.\n\nCommunication issues. The author hung up on the ex when he asked to switch weeks, which could be seen as disrespectful. Maybe a more constructive approach would be to state their position calmly and suggest alternatives, like finding another time in the future. The author also didn't explain the situation to the kids properly, leading to misunderstandings and hurt feelings. The kids might feel they're being punished for their parents' conflict.\n\nPotential for being the asshole. The author is standing up for their legal rights, but the way they handled the situation could be causing unnecessary harm to the kids. If they're rigid without considering the children's well-being, that's a problem. But if the custody agreement is strict and the ex didn't communicate properly, the author isn't wrong. However, the kids' emotional state is a big factor here. The author might need to find a middle ground, like allowing the ex to go with them to Disneyland during their own week, but the author is insisting that it's their time. The key is whether enforcing the schedule is worth the kids' distress. If the author is causing emotional harm, they might be the asshole. But if the agreement is clear and the ex is the one trying to disrupt it, the author is justified.\n\nI think the answer is B, No. The author isn't in the wrong legally, but they might need to improve communication to explain the situation to the kids and perhaps be more understanding. The ex scheduled the event without prior agreement, which is against their mutual understanding. The kids are being manipulated, so the author's stance is valid, but their approach could be softened to reduce the negative impact on the children.\n"
