My son wont even talk to me and my daughter is crying all the time. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA little backstory. Me and my ex divorced shortly after my daughter was born. I blame him for it and he blames me. I won't go into detail here. We ended up with a 50/50 custody agreement switching every other week. While this was 8 years ago we're still not on good terms. We rarely ever talk to each other outside of the kids and i'm perfectly fine with that. One thing we have agreed on since the beginning though is that we don't plan things on days that aren't ours. And unless it's extremely important we don't \"switch\" days or weeks. In the 8 years since we've been divorced I have never asked him to have the kids on a day that isn't mine and I've never given him one of my days even if he begged. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, last week my ex contacted me and told me the \"good\" news. His parents are hosting a week long family reunion in the summer at Disneyland and he want's to take the kids. Well, the problem is that it's on one of my weeks. He asked me to let the kids stay with him that week or to switch a week with me and I shot him down. It's my week with them and I get to spend it with them. I told him if it's so important to him to reschedule but he claims his parents can't do that and this is the only week that the whole family can go and he told me that I need to \"think of them\". I told him \"tough luck\" and hung up on him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this last Sunday when my ex dropped the kids off with me my son refused to talk to me at all and my daughter wouldn't even look at me. When I asked my ex what was wrong he refused to talk to me, only saying \"ask them\" in a snarky tone before leaving. When I asked my daughter what was wrong she burst into tears and said that i was \"not letting daddy take them to Disneyland\". Asking my son (who still refuses to talk to me) it turns out that my ex told them I was not letting them go to Disneyland with him. He's trying to paint me as the bad guy. I sat both of them down last night to talk to them and explain it's my week with them but they refused to listen to me. My daughter just cried and my son told me i'm only doing this to get back at my ex.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm not though. I think its unfair for him to do this when his parents scheduled it during my time with them. I demanded an apology from my ex and him to set things straight but he refuses, and his last text to me being \"can't tell them the truth cause they already know it\". \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm so pissed right now. Am i the asshole because my ex scheduled something during MY time with MY kids? How is it my fault that i'm only using my right to spend time with them? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a parent (the author) who refuses to let their kids go on a vacation with the ex-spouse during the author's custody week. The kids are upset, thinking the author is keeping them from Disneyland. The author has a 50/50 custody agreement and has always stuck to the no-switching policy unless it's extremely important. The ex wants to take the kids during the author's week, but the author says no.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. If they have a 50/50 custody agreement that's part of a court order, then the author's time with the kids is legally protected. The ex would need to get the court's approval to switch weeks, especially if it's not an emergency. The author isn't violating any laws by sticking to the custody schedule.\n\nNext, the emotional aspect. The kids are upset because they think the author is being unfair. The ex is using the kids as a middleman, which isn't good. The author tried to explain the situation to the kids, but they're not listening. The son is even accusing the author of being vindictive. This suggests that the ex might be manipulating the kids' perception, which is problematic.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that the ex shouldn't have scheduled the trip during their custody week. The ex's parents hosted the event during the author's time, which the author isn't at fault for. The key here is whether the ex had the right to schedule the trip during the author's week without prior agreement. Since their agreement states not to plan things on each other's days unless it's extremely important, the ex broke that agreement by scheduling the trip during the author's week without discussion.\n\nHowever, the author could have considered the kids' feelings. Maybe there was a way to find a compromise, but the author's stance is that they've always followed the agreement strictly. The ex's approach of involving the kids in the conflict and not respecting the custody agreement might be the real issue here.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author isn't wrong for upholding the custody arrangement. The ex is the one who initiated the conflict by scheduling the trip during the author's time without mutual agreement. The kids are caught in the middle, but the author isn't the one who made the unilateral decision. The ex is trying to frame the author as the bad guy, which is manipulative.\n\nSo, considering the custody agreement, the legal rights, and the ex's actions, the author isn't in the wrong. The ex is the one who didn't follow the agreement and is now using the kids against the author. The author's refusal to switch weeks isn't unfair; it's sticking to the terms they both agreed on. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
