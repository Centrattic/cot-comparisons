My son wont even talk to me and my daughter is crying all the time. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA little backstory. Me and my ex divorced shortly after my daughter was born. I blame him for it and he blames me. I won't go into detail here. We ended up with a 50/50 custody agreement switching every other week. While this was 8 years ago we're still not on good terms. We rarely ever talk to each other outside of the kids and i'm perfectly fine with that. One thing we have agreed on since the beginning though is that we don't plan things on days that aren't ours. And unless it's extremely important we don't \"switch\" days or weeks. In the 8 years since we've been divorced I have never asked him to have the kids on a day that isn't mine and I've never given him one of my days even if he begged. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, last week my ex contacted me and told me the \"good\" news. His parents are hosting a week long family reunion in the summer at Disneyland and he want's to take the kids. Well, the problem is that it's on one of my weeks. He asked me to let the kids stay with him that week or to switch a week with me and I shot him down. It's my week with them and I get to spend it with them. I told him if it's so important to him to reschedule but he claims his parents can't do that and this is the only week that the whole family can go and he told me that I need to \"think of them\". I told him \"tough luck\" and hung up on him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this last Sunday when my ex dropped the kids off with me my son refused to talk to me at all and my daughter wouldn't even look at me. When I asked my ex what was wrong he refused to talk to me, only saying \"ask them\" in a snarky tone before leaving. When I asked my daughter what was wrong she burst into tears and said that i was \"not letting daddy take them to Disneyland\". Asking my son (who still refuses to talk to me) it turns out that my ex told them I was not letting them go to Disneyland with him. He's trying to paint me as the bad guy. I sat both of them down last night to talk to them and explain it's my week with them but they refused to listen to me. My daughter just cried and my son told me i'm only doing this to get back at my ex.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm not though. I think its unfair for him to do this when his parents scheduled it during my time with them. I demanded an apology from my ex and him to set things straight but he refuses, and his last text to me being \"can't tell them the truth cause they already know it\". \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm so pissed right now. Am i the asshole because my ex scheduled something during MY time with MY kids? How is it my fault that i'm only using my right to spend time with them? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a custody dispute where the parent (the author) refused to let their kids go on a vacation with their ex during a scheduled visitation week.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the custody arrangement. It's 50/50, switching every other week. The key point here is that they agreed not to plan things on days that aren't theirs and rarely switch weeks unless it's extremely important. The author hasn't given up their weeks before, even when the ex asked. This time, the ex wants to take the kids to Disneyland during the author's week. The author says no because it's their time. The kids are upset because they think the author is blocking them from going, and the ex isn't helping by not correcting them.\n\nNow, the legal aspect: In 50/50 custody, each parent typically has equal rights to the children during their scheduled time. Unless there's a specific agreement allowing for exceptions, one parent can't unilaterally schedule activities during the other's time without agreement. The author isn't violating the custody agreement by not giving up their week. The ex's parents scheduled the trip during the author's week, so the ex is asking the author to adjust, but the author is sticking to the original schedule.\n\nEmotionally, the kids are upset because they want to go to Disneyland with their ex. The author is trying to protect their time with the kids. The ex is portrayed as the antagonist here, using the kids to undermine the author. The author isn't the one breaking the agreement; the ex is asking for a switch that the author isn't required to agree to. The kids are being manipulated by the ex to see the author as the bad guy, which complicates things.\n\nPossible angles to consider: Is there any legal obligation to allow such a trip? The author's refusal is within their rights under a standard 50/50 arrangement unless there's a specific clause allowing for exceptions. The ex isn't following the agreement by asking for a switch without an \"extremely important\" reason. The author isn't at fault for upholding the original schedule. The kids' anger is because of the situation, but the author isn't the one scheduling the trip. The ex is the one initiating the request, and the author is declining. The author is also trying to communicate with the kids, but they're not listening due to the ex's influence.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The author isn't in the wrong because they're adhering to the custody agreement. The ex is the one making an unreasonable request. The author is protecting their time with the kids, which is their right. The kids are caught in the middle, but the fault lies with the ex's manipulation.\n"
