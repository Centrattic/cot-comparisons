My son wont even talk to me and my daughter is crying all the time. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA little backstory. Me and my ex divorced shortly after my daughter was born. I blame him for it and he blames me. I won't go into detail here. We ended up with a 50/50 custody agreement switching every other week. While this was 8 years ago we're still not on good terms. We rarely ever talk to each other outside of the kids and i'm perfectly fine with that. One thing we have agreed on since the beginning though is that we don't plan things on days that aren't ours. And unless it's extremely important we don't \"switch\" days or weeks. In the 8 years since we've been divorced I have never asked him to have the kids on a day that isn't mine and I've never given him one of my days even if he begged. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, last week my ex contacted me and told me the \"good\" news. His parents are hosting a week long family reunion in the summer at Disneyland and he want's to take the kids. Well, the problem is that it's on one of my weeks. He asked me to let the kids stay with him that week or to switch a week with me and I shot him down. It's my week with them and I get to spend it with them. I told him if it's so important to him to reschedule but he claims his parents can't do that and this is the only week that the whole family can go and he told me that I need to \"think of them\". I told him \"tough luck\" and hung up on him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this last Sunday when my ex dropped the kids off with me my son refused to talk to me at all and my daughter wouldn't even look at me. When I asked my ex what was wrong he refused to talk to me, only saying \"ask them\" in a snarky tone before leaving. When I asked my daughter what was wrong she burst into tears and said that i was \"not letting daddy take them to Disneyland\". Asking my son (who still refuses to talk to me) it turns out that my ex told them I was not letting them go to Disneyland with him. He's trying to paint me as the bad guy. I sat both of them down last night to talk to them and explain it's my week with them but they refused to listen to me. My daughter just cried and my son told me i'm only doing this to get back at my ex.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm not though. I think its unfair for him to do this when his parents scheduled it during my time with them. I demanded an apology from my ex and him to set things straight but he refuses, and his last text to me being \"can't tell them the truth cause they already know it\". \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm so pissed right now. Am i the asshole because my ex scheduled something during MY time with MY kids? How is it my fault that i'm only using my right to spend time with them? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a custody dispute where the parent (author) isn't allowing their kids to go on a vacation with the ex during their scheduled time. The kids are upset, and the author is defending their decision.\n\nFirst, the key points from the backstory: They have a 50/50 custody arrangement, established 8 years ago, and they agreed not to switch days unless it's extremely important. The ex wants to take the kids to Disneyland during the author's week, asking to switch or let the kids stay with him. The author refused, leading to the kids being upset and the ex not apologizing.\n\nNow, the author's stance is that they're standing by their custody agreement. They didn't switch weeks even when the ex asked, so they feel they're in the right. The kids are upset because they think the author is being unfair, not allowing them to go. The ex is using this as a way to make the kids see the author as the bad guy.\n\nHmm, the author's main argument is that the custody arrangement was agreed upon, and the ex is violating it by planning the trip during the author's time. The author isn't switching weeks unless it's extremely important, which the ex claims is the case here (family reunion with parents). The author thinks the ex is using this to manipulate the kids.\n\nBut the kids are caught in the middle. The son is not talking, the daughter is crying. The author is upset that the ex isn't apologizing and is painting them as the villain. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nSo, legally, if the custody is 50/50 and they have an agreement not to switch days unless necessary, the author is following the agreement. The ex is making a request during the author's time. The author has the right to say no. However, the kids are upset because they want to go on the trip. The author explains the situation, but the kids are buying into the ex's narrative that the author is being selfish.\n\nIs the author wrong for not switching? It depends on the terms of their custody agreement. If the agreement is strict 50/50 with no flexibility unless both agree, then the author is within their rights. However, maybe the author could have been more flexible, but the ex didn't ask in a nice way. The author's refusal isn't malicious, but the kids are suffering emotionally.\n\nBut the author isn't the one breaking the agreement. The ex is trying to use the kids as pawns. The author is protecting their time. The kids are upset, but the author's actions are legally and according to their prior agreement. The kids might not understand the situation yet, but the author isn't in the wrong for sticking to the agreed-upon custody schedule. The ex is the one trying to manipulate the situation. So maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
