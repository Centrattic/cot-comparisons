My son wont even talk to me and my daughter is crying all the time. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA little backstory. Me and my ex divorced shortly after my daughter was born. I blame him for it and he blames me. I won't go into detail here. We ended up with a 50/50 custody agreement switching every other week. While this was 8 years ago we're still not on good terms. We rarely ever talk to each other outside of the kids and i'm perfectly fine with that. One thing we have agreed on since the beginning though is that we don't plan things on days that aren't ours. And unless it's extremely important we don't \"switch\" days or weeks. In the 8 years since we've been divorced I have never asked him to have the kids on a day that isn't mine and I've never given him one of my days even if he begged. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, last week my ex contacted me and told me the \"good\" news. His parents are hosting a week long family reunion in the summer at Disneyland and he want's to take the kids. Well, the problem is that it's on one of my weeks. He asked me to let the kids stay with him that week or to switch a week with me and I shot him down. It's my week with them and I get to spend it with them. I told him if it's so important to him to reschedule but he claims his parents can't do that and this is the only week that the whole family can go and he told me that I need to \"think of them\". I told him \"tough luck\" and hung up on him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this last Sunday when my ex dropped the kids off with me my son refused to talk to me at all and my daughter wouldn't even look at me. When I asked my ex what was wrong he refused to talk to me, only saying \"ask them\" in a snarky tone before leaving. When I asked my daughter what was wrong she burst into tears and said that i was \"not letting daddy take them to Disneyland\". Asking my son (who still refuses to talk to me) it turns out that my ex told them I was not letting them go to Disneyland with him. He's trying to paint me as the bad guy. I sat both of them down last night to talk to them and explain it's my week with them but they refused to listen to me. My daughter just cried and my son told me i'm only doing this to get back at my ex.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm not though. I think its unfair for him to do this when his parents scheduled it during my time with them. I demanded an apology from my ex and him to set things straight but he refuses, and his last text to me being \"can't tell them the truth cause they already know it\". \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm so pissed right now. Am i the asshole because my ex scheduled something during MY time with MY kids? How is it my fault that i'm only using my right to spend time with them? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a custody dispute after divorce, with a 50/50 arrangement. The author's ex wants to take the kids to Disneyland during the author's week, which would require switching weeks. The author refuses, leading to the kids being upset because they think the author is preventing them from going.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the custody agreement. They have a 50/50 split, and they've agreed not to switch days unless it's extremely important. The author has never given up their time before, which suggests the agreement is clear. The ex's parents scheduled the reunion during the author's week, which complicates things. The ex is asking for a switch, but since it's a family event, maybe there's a reason it's scheduled then. However, the author's stance is that it's their time, and they're not willing to give it up. \n\nThe kids are upset because they think the author is the bad guy. The son is not talking, and the daughter is crying. The ex is using the kids as pawns, perhaps, by not being honest and making the author look like the villain. But the author's refusal to switch could also be seen as prioritizing their own time over the kids' wishes. \n\nLegally, the custody agreement is key. If the agreement doesn't allow for switches unless both agree, then the author is within their rights. However, the emotional impact on the kids is a factor. At 16 and 9, the kids are at different developmental stages. The son might understand the legal rights, but the daughter is younger and more emotional. The author's refusal might be seen as selfish if the kids really wanted to go. \n\nThe author is angry about the ex scheduling during their time, but maybe they should consider the kids' feelings. However, the ex is not following the agreed-upon terms by requesting a switch. The author is standing by the agreement, which is their right. The ex is trying to manipulate the situation, and the author is caught in the middle. \n\nIn terms of being the \"asshole,\" it's about intentions and the impact. The author isn't giving in to the ex's requests, which are outside the agreement. The ex is violating the agreement by trying to switch weeks. The author is protecting their time as agreed. However, the kids are suffering emotionally because of the conflict. The author might need to find a way to explain the situation better to the kids, but legally and by agreement, they might not be in the wrong. \n\nConsidering all this, the author is not in the wrong because they are adhering to the custody agreement. The ex is the one trying to change the terms without agreement. The author's refusal is based on prior agreements, so they're not the asshole here.\n"
