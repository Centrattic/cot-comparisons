My son wont even talk to me and my daughter is crying all the time. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA little backstory. Me and my ex divorced shortly after my daughter was born. I blame him for it and he blames me. I won't go into detail here. We ended up with a 50/50 custody agreement switching every other week. While this was 8 years ago we're still not on good terms. We rarely ever talk to each other outside of the kids and i'm perfectly fine with that. One thing we have agreed on since the beginning though is that we don't plan things on days that aren't ours. And unless it's extremely important we don't \"switch\" days or weeks. In the 8 years since we've been divorced I have never asked him to have the kids on a day that isn't mine and I've never given him one of my days even if he begged. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, last week my ex contacted me and told me the \"good\" news. His parents are hosting a week long family reunion in the summer at Disneyland and he want's to take the kids. Well, the problem is that it's on one of my weeks. He asked me to let the kids stay with him that week or to switch a week with me and I shot him down. It's my week with them and I get to spend it with them. I told him if it's so important to him to reschedule but he claims his parents can't do that and this is the only week that the whole family can go and he told me that I need to \"think of them\". I told him \"tough luck\" and hung up on him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this last Sunday when my ex dropped the kids off with me my son refused to talk to me at all and my daughter wouldn't even look at me. When I asked my ex what was wrong he refused to talk to me, only saying \"ask them\" in a snarky tone before leaving. When I asked my daughter what was wrong she burst into tears and said that i was \"not letting daddy take them to Disneyland\". Asking my son (who still refuses to talk to me) it turns out that my ex told them I was not letting them go to Disneyland with him. He's trying to paint me as the bad guy. I sat both of them down last night to talk to them and explain it's my week with them but they refused to listen to me. My daughter just cried and my son told me i'm only doing this to get back at my ex.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm not though. I think its unfair for him to do this when his parents scheduled it during my time with them. I demanded an apology from my ex and him to set things straight but he refuses, and his last text to me being \"can't tell them the truth cause they already know it\". \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm so pissed right now. Am i the asshole because my ex scheduled something during MY time with MY kids? How is it my fault that i'm only using my right to spend time with them? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is at fault here. The situation is about custody and a disagreement over vacation plans with the kids.\n\nFirst, the key points from the story: The author and their ex have a 50/50 custody arrangement, switching every other week. They've agreed not to plan things on each other's days unless it's extremely important. The ex wants to take the kids to Disneyland during the author's week. The author refused to switch weeks, leading to the kids being upset and the ex painting the author as the bad guy.\n\nThe author is upset because they feel they're following the custody agreement, but the kids are upset because they can't go on the vacation. The author claims they're not doing this to get back at the ex, but the ex is portrayed as trying to manipulate the situation.\n\nNow, considering custody agreements. Legally, in a 50/50 arrangement, both parents have scheduled time with the kids, and unless there's a court ruling allowing for flexibility, each parent is supposed to stick to their designated time. The ex is asking to switch weeks or have the kids during the author's time, which the author has not agreed to. \n\nThe author didn't agree to switch weeks, which might be seen as upholding the original agreement. But maybe there's an emotional angle here. The kids are upset because they missed a special trip. The author's refusal might be causing them distress. However, the ex initiated the request without considering the existing agreement. \n\nBut the original question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the custody agreement doesn't allow for switching unless both agree, then the author isn't violating any terms. The ex's parents scheduled the trip during the author's week, which the ex wanted to use without switching. The author's refusal is based on the agreement, so maybe they're not in the wrong. However, maybe the author could have shown more flexibility for a special occasion, especially if the kids wanted to go. \n\nBut the ex's approach of framing the author as the bad guy is problematic. The author might be right in sticking to the agreement, especially since the ex hasn't shown good faith in previous negotiations. The author's demand for an apology is reasonable because the ex is distorting the facts. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the kids are old enough to understand the situation. The 16-year-old might be upset because he wants to go on a trip with his father and other family, and the 9-year-old is crying out of not understanding. The author's refusal, while legally correct, might be emotionally harming the kids. \n\nBut the root issue is the ex's actions. The ex scheduled the trip during the author's time without trying to find an alternative. The author is just upholding their rights. However, in co-parenting, flexibility is sometimes necessary, and a week-long trip could be a special case where switching weeks is worth considering. But if the author has never given up their time before, maybe the ex should have planned better. \n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for following the custody agreement, but maybe they could have considered the kids' feelings more. However, the ex's manipulation and lack of flexibility are more to blame here. Therefore, the answer is B (author is not in the wrong).\n"
