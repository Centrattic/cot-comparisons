My son wont even talk to me and my daughter is crying all the time. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA little backstory. Me and my ex divorced shortly after my daughter was born. I blame him for it and he blames me. I won't go into detail here. We ended up with a 50/50 custody agreement switching every other week. While this was 8 years ago we're still not on good terms. We rarely ever talk to each other outside of the kids and i'm perfectly fine with that. One thing we have agreed on since the beginning though is that we don't plan things on days that aren't ours. And unless it's extremely important we don't \"switch\" days or weeks. In the 8 years since we've been divorced I have never asked him to have the kids on a day that isn't mine and I've never given him one of my days even if he begged. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, last week my ex contacted me and told me the \"good\" news. His parents are hosting a week long family reunion in the summer at Disneyland and he want's to take the kids. Well, the problem is that it's on one of my weeks. He asked me to let the kids stay with him that week or to switch a week with me and I shot him down. It's my week with them and I get to spend it with them. I told him if it's so important to him to reschedule but he claims his parents can't do that and this is the only week that the whole family can go and he told me that I need to \"think of them\". I told him \"tough luck\" and hung up on him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this last Sunday when my ex dropped the kids off with me my son refused to talk to me at all and my daughter wouldn't even look at me. When I asked my ex what was wrong he refused to talk to me, only saying \"ask them\" in a snarky tone before leaving. When I asked my daughter what was wrong she burst into tears and said that i was \"not letting daddy take them to Disneyland\". Asking my son (who still refuses to talk to me) it turns out that my ex told them I was not letting them go to Disneyland with him. He's trying to paint me as the bad guy. I sat both of them down last night to talk to them and explain it's my week with them but they refused to listen to me. My daughter just cried and my son told me i'm only doing this to get back at my ex.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm not though. I think its unfair for him to do this when his parents scheduled it during my time with them. I demanded an apology from my ex and him to set things straight but he refuses, and his last text to me being \"can't tell them the truth cause they already know it\". \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm so pissed right now. Am i the asshole because my ex scheduled something during MY time with MY kids? How is it my fault that i'm only using my right to spend time with them? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about a custody dispute between the author and their ex regarding vacation time with their kids.\n\nFirst, the key facts: They have a 50/50 custody arrangement that's been in place for 8 years, switching every other week. Both agree not to plan things on days that aren't theirs unless it's extremely important. The author has never given up their time before. Now, the ex wants to take the kids to Disneyland during the author's week. The author refuses, leading to the kids being upset and the ex blaming the author.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that it's their week, so they should have the right to spend it with the kids. The ex's parents can't reschedule the reunion, and the ex claims it's important for the whole family. The kids are upset because they were told the author is preventing them from going, and the author feels wronged because they think the ex is using their kids to punish them.\n\nTo determine if the author is in the wrong, I need to consider the custody agreement and the dynamics here. The agreement was to not switch weeks unless it's extremely important. The ex is asking for a switch here. The author has stood by the agreement consistently for 8 years. The ex is now trying to bend the rules for a vacation. \n\nHowever, the kids are getting hurt in the middle. The author's refusal might disrupt their children's wishes. But the custody agreement was supposed to be a mutual agreement to respect each other's time. The ex's unilateral decision to schedule a vacation during the author's week might be the issue. \n\nFrom a legal perspective, if the custody agreement is in place and followed by both parties, the author isn't violating it. The ex might be trying to make a last-minute change. But the emotional impact is significant. The kids are upset, which could imply that the author's rigidity is causing harm. However, the author also might be protecting their own time as agreed. \n\nThe question is whether the author is being unreasonable in not considering the kids' desires. But the agreement is about mutual respect, and the author has never given up their time before. The ex might be trying to manipulate the situation to make the author look bad. \n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the author's adherence to the agreement is reasonable despite the kids' feelings. Since the agreement was mutual and the author has followed it, they might not be in the wrong. However, not considering the kids' wishes could be seen as neglecting their needs. But given the context of the custody agreement and the ex's past behavior, the author might be justified in standing their ground. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
