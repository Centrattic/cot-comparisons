My son wont even talk to me and my daughter is crying all the time. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA little backstory. Me and my ex divorced shortly after my daughter was born. I blame him for it and he blames me. I won't go into detail here. We ended up with a 50/50 custody agreement switching every other week. While this was 8 years ago we're still not on good terms. We rarely ever talk to each other outside of the kids and i'm perfectly fine with that. One thing we have agreed on since the beginning though is that we don't plan things on days that aren't ours. And unless it's extremely important we don't \"switch\" days or weeks. In the 8 years since we've been divorced I have never asked him to have the kids on a day that isn't mine and I've never given him one of my days even if he begged. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, last week my ex contacted me and told me the \"good\" news. His parents are hosting a week long family reunion in the summer at Disneyland and he want's to take the kids. Well, the problem is that it's on one of my weeks. He asked me to let the kids stay with him that week or to switch a week with me and I shot him down. It's my week with them and I get to spend it with them. I told him if it's so important to him to reschedule but he claims his parents can't do that and this is the only week that the whole family can go and he told me that I need to \"think of them\". I told him \"tough luck\" and hung up on him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this last Sunday when my ex dropped the kids off with me my son refused to talk to me at all and my daughter wouldn't even look at me. When I asked my ex what was wrong he refused to talk to me, only saying \"ask them\" in a snarky tone before leaving. When I asked my daughter what was wrong she burst into tears and said that i was \"not letting daddy take them to Disneyland\". Asking my son (who still refuses to talk to me) it turns out that my ex told them I was not letting them go to Disneyland with him. He's trying to paint me as the bad guy. I sat both of them down last night to talk to them and explain it's my week with them but they refused to listen to me. My daughter just cried and my son told me i'm only doing this to get back at my ex.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm not though. I think its unfair for him to do this when his parents scheduled it during my time with them. I demanded an apology from my ex and him to set things straight but he refuses, and his last text to me being \"can't tell them the truth cause they already know it\". \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm so pissed right now. Am i the asshole because my ex scheduled something during MY time with MY kids? How is it my fault that i'm only using my right to spend time with them? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves custody arrangements and a disagreement over vacation plans.\n\nFirst, the key points from the story: The parents have a 50/50 custody agreement, established 8 years ago. They've agreed not to plan things on each other's weeks unless it's extremely important. The ex wants to take the kids to Disneyland during the author's week, asking to switch weeks or have the kids stay with him. The author refuses, leading to the kids being upset and the ex framing the author as the bad guy.\n\nThe author's stance is that they're upholding the custody agreement, which the ex is violating by requesting time during the author's scheduled week. The author also mentions that they've never switched weeks before, even when asked. The ex, on the other hand, is trying to get the kids to Disneyland during the author's time, which the author sees as unfair.\n\nNow, considering custody agreements, they are typically legally binding. If the agreement states that each parent has the kids on specific weeks without switching unless both agree, then the author is within their rights to enforce that. The ex is asking for a switch without a valid reason, which the author is not obligated to agree to. The author isn't the one breaking the agreement here; the ex is trying to use the kids to push for a change in the schedule without mutual consent.\n\nThe kids are upset because they want to go on the trip, but the author is trying to follow the established custody plan. The author explains their position to the kids, but the ex has already painted them as the villain, which complicates the situation. The author isn't trying to punish the ex; they're standing by the legal agreement they both agreed to. \n\nPossible angles where the author might be wrong: Could there be flexibility in the agreement? If the ex had a valid reason (like a family emergency), maybe. But here, it's a family reunion that the ex's parents scheduled. The author isn't being unreasonable by sticking to the agreement, especially since the ex hasn't provided a compelling reason to switch. Also, the author isn't denying the kids the trip entirely; they\u2019re just holding to the scheduled time. The ex is the one who initiated the request, and the author is declining it as per their agreement.\n\nIn terms of the kids' reactions, the author is caught in a tough spot where the ex is using the kids against them. The kids are upset, but the author isn't at fault for enforcing the custody schedule. The ex isn't respecting the agreed-upon terms by asking for a switch without a valid reason. So the author isn't the asshole here; they're upholding their legal rights under the custody agreement.\n"
