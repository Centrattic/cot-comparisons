My son wont even talk to me and my daughter is crying all the time. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA little backstory. Me and my ex divorced shortly after my daughter was born. I blame him for it and he blames me. I won't go into detail here. We ended up with a 50/50 custody agreement switching every other week. While this was 8 years ago we're still not on good terms. We rarely ever talk to each other outside of the kids and i'm perfectly fine with that. One thing we have agreed on since the beginning though is that we don't plan things on days that aren't ours. And unless it's extremely important we don't \"switch\" days or weeks. In the 8 years since we've been divorced I have never asked him to have the kids on a day that isn't mine and I've never given him one of my days even if he begged. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, last week my ex contacted me and told me the \"good\" news. His parents are hosting a week long family reunion in the summer at Disneyland and he want's to take the kids. Well, the problem is that it's on one of my weeks. He asked me to let the kids stay with him that week or to switch a week with me and I shot him down. It's my week with them and I get to spend it with them. I told him if it's so important to him to reschedule but he claims his parents can't do that and this is the only week that the whole family can go and he told me that I need to \"think of them\". I told him \"tough luck\" and hung up on him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this last Sunday when my ex dropped the kids off with me my son refused to talk to me at all and my daughter wouldn't even look at me. When I asked my ex what was wrong he refused to talk to me, only saying \"ask them\" in a snarky tone before leaving. When I asked my daughter what was wrong she burst into tears and said that i was \"not letting daddy take them to Disneyland\". Asking my son (who still refuses to talk to me) it turns out that my ex told them I was not letting them go to Disneyland with him. He's trying to paint me as the bad guy. I sat both of them down last night to talk to them and explain it's my week with them but they refused to listen to me. My daughter just cried and my son told me i'm only doing this to get back at my ex.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm not though. I think its unfair for him to do this when his parents scheduled it during my time with them. I demanded an apology from my ex and him to set things straight but he refuses, and his last text to me being \"can't tell them the truth cause they already know it\". \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm so pissed right now. Am i the asshole because my ex scheduled something during MY time with MY kids? How is it my fault that i'm only using my right to spend time with them? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a custody dispute where the author (parent) refused to switch weeks with their ex so the kids could go on a vacation to Disneyland during the ex's scheduled week. The author maintains a 50/50 custody arrangement and has always stuck to the agreed-upon schedule without switching, even when the ex asked. Now the kids are upset because they think the author is blocking them from going to Disneyland.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and emotional aspects. Legally, if the custody agreement is 50/50 and there's no provision for switching weeks unless both agree, then the author is within their rights. The ex's parents scheduled the event during the author's time, and the author isn't obligated to give up their scheduled week unless there's a mutual agreement. The ex's insistence on having them go during the author's week might be the issue here.\n\nEmotionally, the kids are upset because they want to go on a vacation with both parents. However, the author's stance is about upholding the custody schedule. The ex is portrayed as trying to paint the author as the bad guy, which complicates the situation. The author's refusal to switch could be seen as sticking to the agreement, which is their right, but it's causing emotional distress to the children. However, if the author is not violating any legal terms, they aren't necessarily in the wrong.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that the ex scheduled the event during their time, so it's the ex's fault for not coordinating earlier. The ex claims it's the only possible week, but the author isn't budging. The key point here is whether the author's refusal is justified under the custody terms. Since the author has always followed the schedule strictly, this instance seems consistent with past behavior, which might explain the kids' anger towards the ex rather than the author. However, the kids are upset, and the author might need to address their feelings more compassionately, even if the decision is legally sound.\n\nIn terms of \"Asshole\" status, the question is whether the author's actions are inconsiderate or wrong. The author is prioritizing their scheduled time, which is their right. The ex is the one trying to switch without agreement. However, the author's approach could be seen as rigid, and not considering the kids' feelings, which might make them seem like the antagonist. But legally and according to the agreed terms, the author isn't in the wrong. The emotional toll on the kids is significant, but that's more about the ex's narrative than the author's legal rights. \n\nSo, the answer would hinge on whether the author is following the custody agreement and if their actions are legally justified. Since the author isn't violating the agreement and the ex is the one trying to rearrange without consent, the author isn't in the wrong. However, the way they handled the situation (hanging up, being rigid) might not help the kids' feelings, but it's not a legal or contractual issue. Therefore, the answer is B (Not the Asshole).\n"
