My son wont even talk to me and my daughter is crying all the time. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA little backstory. Me and my ex divorced shortly after my daughter was born. I blame him for it and he blames me. I won't go into detail here. We ended up with a 50/50 custody agreement switching every other week. While this was 8 years ago we're still not on good terms. We rarely ever talk to each other outside of the kids and i'm perfectly fine with that. One thing we have agreed on since the beginning though is that we don't plan things on days that aren't ours. And unless it's extremely important we don't \"switch\" days or weeks. In the 8 years since we've been divorced I have never asked him to have the kids on a day that isn't mine and I've never given him one of my days even if he begged. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, last week my ex contacted me and told me the \"good\" news. His parents are hosting a week long family reunion in the summer at Disneyland and he want's to take the kids. Well, the problem is that it's on one of my weeks. He asked me to let the kids stay with him that week or to switch a week with me and I shot him down. It's my week with them and I get to spend it with them. I told him if it's so important to him to reschedule but he claims his parents can't do that and this is the only week that the whole family can go and he told me that I need to \"think of them\". I told him \"tough luck\" and hung up on him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this last Sunday when my ex dropped the kids off with me my son refused to talk to me at all and my daughter wouldn't even look at me. When I asked my ex what was wrong he refused to talk to me, only saying \"ask them\" in a snarky tone before leaving. When I asked my daughter what was wrong she burst into tears and said that i was \"not letting daddy take them to Disneyland\". Asking my son (who still refuses to talk to me) it turns out that my ex told them I was not letting them go to Disneyland with him. He's trying to paint me as the bad guy. I sat both of them down last night to talk to them and explain it's my week with them but they refused to listen to me. My daughter just cried and my son told me i'm only doing this to get back at my ex.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm not though. I think its unfair for him to do this when his parents scheduled it during my time with them. I demanded an apology from my ex and him to set things straight but he refuses, and his last text to me being \"can't tell them the truth cause they already know it\". \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm so pissed right now. Am i the asshole because my ex scheduled something during MY time with MY kids? How is it my fault that i'm only using my right to spend time with them? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the main issue is that the ex wants to take the kids to Disneyland during the author's custody week, and the author is refusing because it's their scheduled time. The kids are upset because they were promised the trip, and the ex is making the author look bad.\n\nFirst, the custody arrangement is 50/50, which they agreed on. The author mentions they've never switched days before unless it's extremely important, and they've stuck to that. The ex is asking to switch a week, but the author says no. The ex is trying to frame the author as the bad guy by telling the kids it's their fault they can't go. The kids are upset because they were told they could go, but the author is standing by the custody agreement.\n\nLegally, if the custody is split 50/50 with clear terms, the author is probably within their rights to enforce the schedule unless there's an agreement otherwise. The ex is asking for a switch, but the author is not required to comply unless there's some kind of emergency or mutual agreement. The ex is trying to manipulate the kids by blaming the author, which is problematic. The author is trying to explain their position, but the kids are still upset, thinking the author is being unfair. However, the author isn't the one breaking the custody agreement; the ex is the one asking to rearrange the schedule without the author's consent.\n\nThe key points here are the existing custody agreement and the ex's actions. The author isn't violating the agreement by not switching weeks. The ex is the one initiating the change, and the author is refusing. The ex is also using the kids to create conflict by portraying the author as the villain. The kids' emotional reactions are a result of the ex's manipulation, not the author's wrongdoing. The author's stance is about upholding the custody schedule they both agreed on. So, in this situation, the author isn't in the wrong. It's more about the ex not respecting the agreed-upon terms and trying to make the author look bad.\n"
