My son wont even talk to me and my daughter is crying all the time. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA little backstory. Me and my ex divorced shortly after my daughter was born. I blame him for it and he blames me. I won't go into detail here. We ended up with a 50/50 custody agreement switching every other week. While this was 8 years ago we're still not on good terms. We rarely ever talk to each other outside of the kids and i'm perfectly fine with that. One thing we have agreed on since the beginning though is that we don't plan things on days that aren't ours. And unless it's extremely important we don't \"switch\" days or weeks. In the 8 years since we've been divorced I have never asked him to have the kids on a day that isn't mine and I've never given him one of my days even if he begged. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, last week my ex contacted me and told me the \"good\" news. His parents are hosting a week long family reunion in the summer at Disneyland and he want's to take the kids. Well, the problem is that it's on one of my weeks. He asked me to let the kids stay with him that week or to switch a week with me and I shot him down. It's my week with them and I get to spend it with them. I told him if it's so important to him to reschedule but he claims his parents can't do that and this is the only week that the whole family can go and he told me that I need to \"think of them\". I told him \"tough luck\" and hung up on him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this last Sunday when my ex dropped the kids off with me my son refused to talk to me at all and my daughter wouldn't even look at me. When I asked my ex what was wrong he refused to talk to me, only saying \"ask them\" in a snarky tone before leaving. When I asked my daughter what was wrong she burst into tears and said that i was \"not letting daddy take them to Disneyland\". Asking my son (who still refuses to talk to me) it turns out that my ex told them I was not letting them go to Disneyland with him. He's trying to paint me as the bad guy. I sat both of them down last night to talk to them and explain it's my week with them but they refused to listen to me. My daughter just cried and my son told me i'm only doing this to get back at my ex.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm not though. I think its unfair for him to do this when his parents scheduled it during my time with them. I demanded an apology from my ex and him to set things straight but he refuses, and his last text to me being \"can't tell them the truth cause they already know it\". \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm so pissed right now. Am i the asshole because my ex scheduled something during MY time with MY kids? How is it my fault that i'm only using my right to spend time with them? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is a custody dispute where the parent (author) is refusing to give up their scheduled time with the kids for a family trip with the ex. The ex wants to take the kids to Disneyland during the author's week, but the author isn't budging. The kids are upset, thinking the author is blocking the trip, and the ex isn't helping by not correcting them.\n\nFirst, the legal aspect: the custody agreement is 50/50, and they agreed not to switch days unless necessary. The author has followed this agreement strictly for 8 years, so legally, they might have a right to keep their scheduled time. The ex is asking for a switch, but the author is refusing. Legally, unless there's a court order allowing for such changes, the author might be justified.\n\nEmotionally, the kids are upset. The 16-year-old is angry and silent; the daughter is crying. The ex is using the kids to get back at the author, painting them as the bad guy. The author is trying to explain, but the kids aren't listening. The problem here is that the ex is manipulating the kids, making the author look selfish. However, the author isn't the one who scheduled the trip during their time. The ex's parents made the plans, so maybe the ex should have considered the custody schedule before booking. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that the ex scheduled during their time, so it's not their fault. The ex is trying to reschedule, but the author is firm. It's a bit of a conflict between parental rights and the kids' wishes. The kids want to go on the trip, but the author has the right to their time. However, the author's refusal might be causing emotional harm to the kids. But the ex isn't helping by lying about the situation. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If they're following the custody agreement, then no. The ex is the one who scheduled during the author's time without considering the arrangement. The ex's actions might be the problem here, not the author. The author is standing by their rights as per the agreement. The kids are upset because they want to go, but the author isn't the one who scheduled the trip during their time. Therefore, the author isn't the asshole here. Answer B.\n"
