My son wont even talk to me and my daughter is crying all the time. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA little backstory. Me and my ex divorced shortly after my daughter was born. I blame him for it and he blames me. I won't go into detail here. We ended up with a 50/50 custody agreement switching every other week. While this was 8 years ago we're still not on good terms. We rarely ever talk to each other outside of the kids and i'm perfectly fine with that. One thing we have agreed on since the beginning though is that we don't plan things on days that aren't ours. And unless it's extremely important we don't \"switch\" days or weeks. In the 8 years since we've been divorced I have never asked him to have the kids on a day that isn't mine and I've never given him one of my days even if he begged. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, last week my ex contacted me and told me the \"good\" news. His parents are hosting a week long family reunion in the summer at Disneyland and he want's to take the kids. Well, the problem is that it's on one of my weeks. He asked me to let the kids stay with him that week or to switch a week with me and I shot him down. It's my week with them and I get to spend it with them. I told him if it's so important to him to reschedule but he claims his parents can't do that and this is the only week that the whole family can go and he told me that I need to \"think of them\". I told him \"tough luck\" and hung up on him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this last Sunday when my ex dropped the kids off with me my son refused to talk to me at all and my daughter wouldn't even look at me. When I asked my ex what was wrong he refused to talk to me, only saying \"ask them\" in a snarky tone before leaving. When I asked my daughter what was wrong she burst into tears and said that i was \"not letting daddy take them to Disneyland\". Asking my son (who still refuses to talk to me) it turns out that my ex told them I was not letting them go to Disneyland with him. He's trying to paint me as the bad guy. I sat both of them down last night to talk to them and explain it's my week with them but they refused to listen to me. My daughter just cried and my son told me i'm only doing this to get back at my ex.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm not though. I think its unfair for him to do this when his parents scheduled it during my time with them. I demanded an apology from my ex and him to set things straight but he refuses, and his last text to me being \"can't tell them the truth cause they already know it\". \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm so pissed right now. Am i the asshole because my ex scheduled something during MY time with MY kids? How is it my fault that i'm only using my right to spend time with them? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a custody dispute after a divorce. The key points are that they have a 50/50 custody arrangement, and the ex wants to take the kids to Disneyland during the author's week with them. The author refuses, leading to the kids being upset and the ex not backing down.\n\nFirst, let's look at the custody agreement. The author mentions they have an agreed-upon 50/50 split and that they don't switch weeks unless it's extremely important. The author hasn't switched before, even when asked. The ex is trying to take the kids during the author's week, which the author is standing by. Legally, if the custody agreement is clear and they have a court order, the author has the right to have the kids during their scheduled week. So from a legal standpoint, the author isn't in the wrong.\n\nBut emotionally, the kids are upset. The author says they tried to explain it's their time, but the kids believe the ex's narrative that the author is being unfair. The ex is using the kids as pawns to manipulate the author, which is a problem. The author did refuse to switch, which is their right, but maybe the way they handled it could be improved. For example, they could have been more empathetic or found a compromise if possible. However, the ex isn't offering a valid reason to switch, just stating it's the only week. The author's stance is based on the agreement they've had for years.\n\nThe ex's actions might be the bigger issue here. Using the kids in this way to get what he wants without respecting the custody agreement could be the real problem. The author isn't wrong for upholding their rights. The kids being upset is sad, but the author is trying to explain the situation. However, maybe there's a lack of communication or understanding of the kids' feelings. But the main issue is the ex breaking the agreement, so the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
