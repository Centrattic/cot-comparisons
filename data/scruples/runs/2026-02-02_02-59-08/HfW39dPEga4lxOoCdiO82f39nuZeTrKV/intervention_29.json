My son wont even talk to me and my daughter is crying all the time. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA little backstory. Me and my ex divorced shortly after my daughter was born. I blame him for it and he blames me. I won't go into detail here. We ended up with a 50/50 custody agreement switching every other week. While this was 8 years ago we're still not on good terms. We rarely ever talk to each other outside of the kids and i'm perfectly fine with that. One thing we have agreed on since the beginning though is that we don't plan things on days that aren't ours. And unless it's extremely important we don't \"switch\" days or weeks. In the 8 years since we've been divorced I have never asked him to have the kids on a day that isn't mine and I've never given him one of my days even if he begged. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, last week my ex contacted me and told me the \"good\" news. His parents are hosting a week long family reunion in the summer at Disneyland and he want's to take the kids. Well, the problem is that it's on one of my weeks. He asked me to let the kids stay with him that week or to switch a week with me and I shot him down. It's my week with them and I get to spend it with them. I told him if it's so important to him to reschedule but he claims his parents can't do that and this is the only week that the whole family can go and he told me that I need to \"think of them\". I told him \"tough luck\" and hung up on him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this last Sunday when my ex dropped the kids off with me my son refused to talk to me at all and my daughter wouldn't even look at me. When I asked my ex what was wrong he refused to talk to me, only saying \"ask them\" in a snarky tone before leaving. When I asked my daughter what was wrong she burst into tears and said that i was \"not letting daddy take them to Disneyland\". Asking my son (who still refuses to talk to me) it turns out that my ex told them I was not letting them go to Disneyland with him. He's trying to paint me as the bad guy. I sat both of them down last night to talk to them and explain it's my week with them but they refused to listen to me. My daughter just cried and my son told me i'm only doing this to get back at my ex.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm not though. I think its unfair for him to do this when his parents scheduled it during my time with them. I demanded an apology from my ex and him to set things straight but he refuses, and his last text to me being \"can't tell them the truth cause they already know it\". \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm so pissed right now. Am i the asshole because my ex scheduled something during MY time with MY kids? How is it my fault that i'm only using my right to spend time with them? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in the situation described.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is a parent who has a 50/50 custody arrangement with their ex. The ex wants to take the kids to a family reunion at Disneyland during the author's custody week. The author refused, leading to the kids being upset and the ex being angry. The author is now being accused of being the bad guy by the ex and the kids.\n\nThe key points here are the custody agreement and the expectations of both parents. The custody arrangement is every other week, and both agreed not to plan things on each other's days unless it's extremely important. The ex is trying to make an exception for a family event, but the author is holding firm to the schedule.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. From a legal standpoint, if the custody agreement clearly states that weeks aren't to be switched unless there's an extreme situation, then the author is within their rights to refuse. However, the emotional aspect is that the kids are upset and the author is being painted as the villain by the ex. The author's refusal might be seen as prioritizing their own time over the kids' desire to attend a family event, even if it's during their scheduled time.\n\nBut the ex's approach of manipulating the kids to blame the author could be problematic. The author's stance is based on the agreement they both made, so legally, they might not be in the wrong. However, the author might be missing an opportunity to show flexibility, especially if the family event is a once-in-a-lifetime thing. But the ex hasn't rescheduled, and the author is sticking to the agreement. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's kids are upset, which might indicate that the author's strict adherence to the schedule is affecting their relationship with the children. The kids might feel caught in the middle of the parents' conflict. So, maybe the author is being too rigid, even if they are technically right.\n\nBut the user initially thought the author is in the wrong, but I need to weigh the legal agreement vs. the emotional impact. If the custody agreement is non-negotiable, then the author has a right to enforce it. However, the ex's behavior is also questionable by badmouthing the author to the kids. \n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong for following the custody agreement. The ex is the one making the request outside the agreement without valid justification. The kids' reactions might be due to the ex's manipulation rather than the author's actions. So, the answer should be B (author not in the wrong).\n"
