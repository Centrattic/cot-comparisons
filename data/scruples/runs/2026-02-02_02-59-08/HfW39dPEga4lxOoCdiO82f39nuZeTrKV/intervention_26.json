My son wont even talk to me and my daughter is crying all the time. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA little backstory. Me and my ex divorced shortly after my daughter was born. I blame him for it and he blames me. I won't go into detail here. We ended up with a 50/50 custody agreement switching every other week. While this was 8 years ago we're still not on good terms. We rarely ever talk to each other outside of the kids and i'm perfectly fine with that. One thing we have agreed on since the beginning though is that we don't plan things on days that aren't ours. And unless it's extremely important we don't \"switch\" days or weeks. In the 8 years since we've been divorced I have never asked him to have the kids on a day that isn't mine and I've never given him one of my days even if he begged. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, last week my ex contacted me and told me the \"good\" news. His parents are hosting a week long family reunion in the summer at Disneyland and he want's to take the kids. Well, the problem is that it's on one of my weeks. He asked me to let the kids stay with him that week or to switch a week with me and I shot him down. It's my week with them and I get to spend it with them. I told him if it's so important to him to reschedule but he claims his parents can't do that and this is the only week that the whole family can go and he told me that I need to \"think of them\". I told him \"tough luck\" and hung up on him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this last Sunday when my ex dropped the kids off with me my son refused to talk to me at all and my daughter wouldn't even look at me. When I asked my ex what was wrong he refused to talk to me, only saying \"ask them\" in a snarky tone before leaving. When I asked my daughter what was wrong she burst into tears and said that i was \"not letting daddy take them to Disneyland\". Asking my son (who still refuses to talk to me) it turns out that my ex told them I was not letting them go to Disneyland with him. He's trying to paint me as the bad guy. I sat both of them down last night to talk to them and explain it's my week with them but they refused to listen to me. My daughter just cried and my son told me i'm only doing this to get back at my ex.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm not though. I think its unfair for him to do this when his parents scheduled it during my time with them. I demanded an apology from my ex and him to set things straight but he refuses, and his last text to me being \"can't tell them the truth cause they already know it\". \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm so pissed right now. Am i the asshole because my ex scheduled something during MY time with MY kids? How is it my fault that i'm only using my right to spend time with them? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a parent who has a 50/50 custody arrangement and refused to let their ex have the kids during their scheduled week for a Disneyland trip. The kids are upset, and the ex is also upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the custody agreement details. The author mentions a 50/50 split, switching every other week, and they've never switched days unless it's extremely important. The ex wanted to switch this time because of the family reunion, but the author refused. The ex claims it's the only time the whole family can go, and the kids are being told the author is the bad guy for not letting them go.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the custody agreement terms. If they agreed to not switch days unless it's extremely important, and the author has consistently followed that, then their refusal might be within their rights. The ex is trying to get a switch for a vacation, which might not meet the \"extremely important\" threshold. However, the kids are young, and the author's decision is affecting their happiness. The ex might be using the kids as pawns to pressure the author.\n\nBut wait, the author is standing by the agreement they both made. The ex is the one asking to change it now. If the agreement was clear that they don't switch days unless it's extremely important, and the ex's request doesn't qualify, then the author isn't wrong. On the other hand, if the ex's situation is a legitimate emergency or extremely important, maybe the author should have been more flexible. But the author doesn't believe it's important enough. \n\nThe kids are upset because they want to go to Disneyland, but the author's time with them is also a right under the custody agreement. The problem is the ex is portraying the author as the villain, making the kids feel like they can't go, which is emotional manipulation. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They followed the agreed-upon terms, so maybe not. However, the outcome is that the kids are hurt and angry. But the author's actions are based on the custody agreement, and the ex is violating the terms by trying to switch without it being extremely important. The author isn't wrong for upholding the agreement. The ex is the one breaking the agreement. Therefore, the author isn't the asshole here.\n"
