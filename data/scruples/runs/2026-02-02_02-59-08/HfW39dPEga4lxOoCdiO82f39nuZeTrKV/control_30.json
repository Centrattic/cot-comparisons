My son wont even talk to me and my daughter is crying all the time. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA little backstory. Me and my ex divorced shortly after my daughter was born. I blame him for it and he blames me. I won't go into detail here. We ended up with a 50/50 custody agreement switching every other week. While this was 8 years ago we're still not on good terms. We rarely ever talk to each other outside of the kids and i'm perfectly fine with that. One thing we have agreed on since the beginning though is that we don't plan things on days that aren't ours. And unless it's extremely important we don't \"switch\" days or weeks. In the 8 years since we've been divorced I have never asked him to have the kids on a day that isn't mine and I've never given him one of my days even if he begged. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, last week my ex contacted me and told me the \"good\" news. His parents are hosting a week long family reunion in the summer at Disneyland and he want's to take the kids. Well, the problem is that it's on one of my weeks. He asked me to let the kids stay with him that week or to switch a week with me and I shot him down. It's my week with them and I get to spend it with them. I told him if it's so important to him to reschedule but he claims his parents can't do that and this is the only week that the whole family can go and he told me that I need to \"think of them\". I told him \"tough luck\" and hung up on him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this last Sunday when my ex dropped the kids off with me my son refused to talk to me at all and my daughter wouldn't even look at me. When I asked my ex what was wrong he refused to talk to me, only saying \"ask them\" in a snarky tone before leaving. When I asked my daughter what was wrong she burst into tears and said that i was \"not letting daddy take them to Disneyland\". Asking my son (who still refuses to talk to me) it turns out that my ex told them I was not letting them go to Disneyland with him. He's trying to paint me as the bad guy. I sat both of them down last night to talk to them and explain it's my week with them but they refused to listen to me. My daughter just cried and my son told me i'm only doing this to get back at my ex.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm not though. I think its unfair for him to do this when his parents scheduled it during my time with them. I demanded an apology from my ex and him to set things straight but he refuses, and his last text to me being \"can't tell them the truth cause they already know it\". \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm so pissed right now. Am i the asshole because my ex scheduled something during MY time with MY kids? How is it my fault that i'm only using my right to spend time with them? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a custody arrangement where the parent (the author) is refusing to let the other parent take the kids to a family reunion during their scheduled week.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the key points. The author and ex have a 50/50 custody agreement, switching every other week. They agreed not to plan things during each other's days unless it's extremely important. The ex wanted to switch weeks so the kids could go to Disneyland during the author's week. The author declined, leading to the kids being upset and the ex not apologizing.\n\nNow, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author is sticking to the custody agreement they've had for 8 years. They didn't ask for any changes before, only the ex approached them this time. The ex is trying to get the kids to blame the author. The author is following the agreed terms, so maybe they're in the right. But some might argue that family events are important, but the author's priority is their time with the kids. \n\nLegal aspects might come into play here. If the custody agreement is legally binding and clear about the 50/50 split without exceptions unless both agree, then the author is justified. Emotionally, the kids are upset because they don't understand why they can't go. But the ex is the one trying to change the agreement for personal reasons. The author is enforcing the agreement, so not in the wrong. The answer is likely B (No).\n"
