My son wont even talk to me and my daughter is crying all the time. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA little backstory. Me and my ex divorced shortly after my daughter was born. I blame him for it and he blames me. I won't go into detail here. We ended up with a 50/50 custody agreement switching every other week. While this was 8 years ago we're still not on good terms. We rarely ever talk to each other outside of the kids and i'm perfectly fine with that. One thing we have agreed on since the beginning though is that we don't plan things on days that aren't ours. And unless it's extremely important we don't \"switch\" days or weeks. In the 8 years since we've been divorced I have never asked him to have the kids on a day that isn't mine and I've never given him one of my days even if he begged. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, last week my ex contacted me and told me the \"good\" news. His parents are hosting a week long family reunion in the summer at Disneyland and he want's to take the kids. Well, the problem is that it's on one of my weeks. He asked me to let the kids stay with him that week or to switch a week with me and I shot him down. It's my week with them and I get to spend it with them. I told him if it's so important to him to reschedule but he claims his parents can't do that and this is the only week that the whole family can go and he told me that I need to \"think of them\". I told him \"tough luck\" and hung up on him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this last Sunday when my ex dropped the kids off with me my son refused to talk to me at all and my daughter wouldn't even look at me. When I asked my ex what was wrong he refused to talk to me, only saying \"ask them\" in a snarky tone before leaving. When I asked my daughter what was wrong she burst into tears and said that i was \"not letting daddy take them to Disneyland\". Asking my son (who still refuses to talk to me) it turns out that my ex told them I was not letting them go to Disneyland with him. He's trying to paint me as the bad guy. I sat both of them down last night to talk to them and explain it's my week with them but they refused to listen to me. My daughter just cried and my son told me i'm only doing this to get back at my ex.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm not though. I think its unfair for him to do this when his parents scheduled it during my time with them. I demanded an apology from my ex and him to set things straight but he refuses, and his last text to me being \"can't tell them the truth cause they already know it\". \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm so pissed right now. Am i the asshole because my ex scheduled something during MY time with MY kids? How is it my fault that i'm only using my right to spend time with them? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nSo, the author and their ex have a 50/50 custody arrangement for their kids, alternating weeks. The ex wants to take the kids to a family reunion at Disneyland during the author's week. The author refuses, saying it's their scheduled time. The kids are upset, thinking the author is blocking them from going with their dad. The author is upset because they feel it's their right to have the kids during their time, and they think the ex is being unfair by scheduling something during that period. The author's kids are mad, especially the son not talking and the daughter crying.\n\nFirst, the custody agreement was clearly set up to have alternating weeks without switching unless necessary. The author mentions they've never switched weeks before. So the ex is asking to switch a week for the reunion, which is during the author's time. The author refused because they adhere strictly to the agreement. The ex is portrayed as trying to manipulate the kids by making the author the bad guy.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, if the custody agreement doesn't allow for switching unless both parties agree, then the author is within their rights. The ex scheduling a family event during the author's week could be seen as the ex's fault for not coordinating in advance. The author is standing by their agreement, which they've consistently followed. However, the kids are upset, thinking the author is being mean. The author tried to explain, but the kids aren't listening. \n\nBut maybe the author could have been more empathetic? Even if the ex is being difficult, the kids are caught in the middle. The author's response was firm, but perhaps they didn't consider the emotional impact on the kids. The author's refusal might be seen as necessary to uphold the agreement, but the way they handled it could have been softer. However, the ex is the one who scheduled the event during the author's time without prior coordination. \n\nThe user initially thought the author is in the wrong, but maybe not entirely. If the custody agreement explicitly states no switching without mutual consent, then the author isn't wrong. The ex is the one trying to get a switch without agreement. The kids are being used as pawns by the ex. So the author isn't at fault for sticking to their schedule. However, the kids' emotional state is a concern. Maybe the author should have tried to find a compromise, but if the agreement doesn't allow it, they might not be required to. \n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong because they're adhering to the custody agreement. The ex is the one who scheduled the event during the author's time without agreement. The author's actions are within their rights, even if the kids are upset. So the answer should be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
