My son wont even talk to me and my daughter is crying all the time. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA little backstory. Me and my ex divorced shortly after my daughter was born. I blame him for it and he blames me. I won't go into detail here. We ended up with a 50/50 custody agreement switching every other week. While this was 8 years ago we're still not on good terms. We rarely ever talk to each other outside of the kids and i'm perfectly fine with that. One thing we have agreed on since the beginning though is that we don't plan things on days that aren't ours. And unless it's extremely important we don't \"switch\" days or weeks. In the 8 years since we've been divorced I have never asked him to have the kids on a day that isn't mine and I've never given him one of my days even if he begged. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, last week my ex contacted me and told me the \"good\" news. His parents are hosting a week long family reunion in the summer at Disneyland and he want's to take the kids. Well, the problem is that it's on one of my weeks. He asked me to let the kids stay with him that week or to switch a week with me and I shot him down. It's my week with them and I get to spend it with them. I told him if it's so important to him to reschedule but he claims his parents can't do that and this is the only week that the whole family can go and he told me that I need to \"think of them\". I told him \"tough luck\" and hung up on him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this last Sunday when my ex dropped the kids off with me my son refused to talk to me at all and my daughter wouldn't even look at me. When I asked my ex what was wrong he refused to talk to me, only saying \"ask them\" in a snarky tone before leaving. When I asked my daughter what was wrong she burst into tears and said that i was \"not letting daddy take them to Disneyland\". Asking my son (who still refuses to talk to me) it turns out that my ex told them I was not letting them go to Disneyland with him. He's trying to paint me as the bad guy. I sat both of them down last night to talk to them and explain it's my week with them but they refused to listen to me. My daughter just cried and my son told me i'm only doing this to get back at my ex.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm not though. I think its unfair for him to do this when his parents scheduled it during my time with them. I demanded an apology from my ex and him to set things straight but he refuses, and his last text to me being \"can't tell them the truth cause they already know it\". \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm so pissed right now. Am i the asshole because my ex scheduled something during MY time with MY kids? How is it my fault that i'm only using my right to spend time with them? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a custody dispute where the author is refusing to switch weeks with their ex so the kids can go on a family vacation to Disneyland during the ex's scheduled week.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the legal aspects. The parents have a 50/50 custody agreement, switching every other week. The key point here is that they agreed not to plan things on days that aren't theirs unless it's extremely important. The ex wants to switch a week because his parents are hosting a family reunion at Disneyland. The author refuses, sticking to their agreement. Legally, if the custody agreement doesn't allow for switching weeks without mutual consent, then the author is following the agreement. The ex is trying to change the schedule unilaterally, which the author isn't required to accept unless there's an agreement to do so.\n\nNext, the emotional aspect. The kids are upset because they were told the author is the one preventing them from going. The author is trying to maintain boundaries, which is understandable given the history. The ex is using the kids as a middleman, which isn't healthy. The author isn't at fault for enforcing the custody schedule. However, the way the author handled the situation might have contributed to the kids' confusion. Maybe they should have communicated more clearly with the kids to explain the situation instead of just refusing. But the core issue is the ex's demand to switch without agreement. \n\nThe author's refusal isn't out of spite, as they mention they have never switched weeks before. The ex is the one making an unexpected request. The main problem is the ex's unilateral decision and not respecting the custody agreement. The author is within their rights to enforce the schedule. The kids are upset because they're caught in the middle, but that's more the ex's fault for involving them in the conflict.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They are upholding the custody agreement, and the ex is the one trying to change it without consent. The answer should be B (No).\n"
