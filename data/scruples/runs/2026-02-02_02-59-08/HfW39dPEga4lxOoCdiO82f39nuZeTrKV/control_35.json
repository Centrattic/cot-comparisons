My son wont even talk to me and my daughter is crying all the time. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA little backstory. Me and my ex divorced shortly after my daughter was born. I blame him for it and he blames me. I won't go into detail here. We ended up with a 50/50 custody agreement switching every other week. While this was 8 years ago we're still not on good terms. We rarely ever talk to each other outside of the kids and i'm perfectly fine with that. One thing we have agreed on since the beginning though is that we don't plan things on days that aren't ours. And unless it's extremely important we don't \"switch\" days or weeks. In the 8 years since we've been divorced I have never asked him to have the kids on a day that isn't mine and I've never given him one of my days even if he begged. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, last week my ex contacted me and told me the \"good\" news. His parents are hosting a week long family reunion in the summer at Disneyland and he want's to take the kids. Well, the problem is that it's on one of my weeks. He asked me to let the kids stay with him that week or to switch a week with me and I shot him down. It's my week with them and I get to spend it with them. I told him if it's so important to him to reschedule but he claims his parents can't do that and this is the only week that the whole family can go and he told me that I need to \"think of them\". I told him \"tough luck\" and hung up on him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this last Sunday when my ex dropped the kids off with me my son refused to talk to me at all and my daughter wouldn't even look at me. When I asked my ex what was wrong he refused to talk to me, only saying \"ask them\" in a snarky tone before leaving. When I asked my daughter what was wrong she burst into tears and said that i was \"not letting daddy take them to Disneyland\". Asking my son (who still refuses to talk to me) it turns out that my ex told them I was not letting them go to Disneyland with him. He's trying to paint me as the bad guy. I sat both of them down last night to talk to them and explain it's my week with them but they refused to listen to me. My daughter just cried and my son told me i'm only doing this to get back at my ex.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm not though. I think its unfair for him to do this when his parents scheduled it during my time with them. I demanded an apology from my ex and him to set things straight but he refuses, and his last text to me being \"can't tell them the truth cause they already know it\". \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm so pissed right now. Am i the asshole because my ex scheduled something during MY time with MY kids? How is it my fault that i'm only using my right to spend time with them? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a custody arrangement where they have 50/50 custody, switching every other week. The user (AITA) is the parent who's currently supposed to have the kids for a week, but the ex wants to take them to Disneyland during that time. The ex is asking to switch weeks, but the author refuses because they've never done that before and think it's unfair since the parents scheduled it during their time.\n\nFirst, the custody agreement is 50/50, which typically means both parents have equal time with the kids. The key point here is that they agreed not to plan things on each other's days unless it's extremely important. The ex is trying to switch a week for the reunion, which is a family event. The author hasn't given up their scheduled time before, even when asked. The ex is now making the kids upset by telling them the author is blocking their trip, making the kids think the parent is being unreasonable.\n\nNow, legally, in many places, a 50/50 custody arrangement does mean both parents have the right to their scheduled time. The ex is asking to switch, but the author isn't required to agree unless there's a mutual agreement. However, the issue here is the kids' feelings. The kids are upset because they want to go to Disneyland with their other parent, and the author's refusal is causing conflict. The author says it's their time, but the kids are taking it personally, especially since the ex is painting the author as the bad guy.\n\nIs the author wrong for standing by their custody agreement? Well, they have the legal right to their time, but maybe they should consider the kids' well-being. If the kids are distressed, maybe the parent should find a compromise. However, the ex is using the kids as a middleman and not being cooperative. The author might be within their rights but could be handling it poorly by not communicating better with the kids. The kids might need to understand that the parent can't just switch weeks on a whim, especially if it's a long-standing agreement. The ex isn't helping by making the kids upset and not being honest, as mentioned in the last text.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong legally or by the custody terms, but maybe emotionally or in terms of handling the kids' feelings. However, the question is whether they are the asshole, which is more about behavior and fairness. The author's stance is firm on their rights, but the ex is being manipulative. The kids are caught in the middle. The author might not be in the wrong for following the custody agreement but could be missing an opportunity to show flexibility for the kids' happiness. However, the ex's actions are problematic too. \n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for not giving up their scheduled time, as they've maintained the agreement for 8 years. The ex is the one making unilateral decisions and causing conflict. The answer would be B (not in the wrong).\n"
