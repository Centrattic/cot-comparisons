My son wont even talk to me and my daughter is crying all the time. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA little backstory. Me and my ex divorced shortly after my daughter was born. I blame him for it and he blames me. I won't go into detail here. We ended up with a 50/50 custody agreement switching every other week. While this was 8 years ago we're still not on good terms. We rarely ever talk to each other outside of the kids and i'm perfectly fine with that. One thing we have agreed on since the beginning though is that we don't plan things on days that aren't ours. And unless it's extremely important we don't \"switch\" days or weeks. In the 8 years since we've been divorced I have never asked him to have the kids on a day that isn't mine and I've never given him one of my days even if he begged. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, last week my ex contacted me and told me the \"good\" news. His parents are hosting a week long family reunion in the summer at Disneyland and he want's to take the kids. Well, the problem is that it's on one of my weeks. He asked me to let the kids stay with him that week or to switch a week with me and I shot him down. It's my week with them and I get to spend it with them. I told him if it's so important to him to reschedule but he claims his parents can't do that and this is the only week that the whole family can go and he told me that I need to \"think of them\". I told him \"tough luck\" and hung up on him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this last Sunday when my ex dropped the kids off with me my son refused to talk to me at all and my daughter wouldn't even look at me. When I asked my ex what was wrong he refused to talk to me, only saying \"ask them\" in a snarky tone before leaving. When I asked my daughter what was wrong she burst into tears and said that i was \"not letting daddy take them to Disneyland\". Asking my son (who still refuses to talk to me) it turns out that my ex told them I was not letting them go to Disneyland with him. He's trying to paint me as the bad guy. I sat both of them down last night to talk to them and explain it's my week with them but they refused to listen to me. My daughter just cried and my son told me i'm only doing this to get back at my ex.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm not though. I think its unfair for him to do this when his parents scheduled it during my time with them. I demanded an apology from my ex and him to set things straight but he refuses, and his last text to me being \"can't tell them the truth cause they already know it\". \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm so pissed right now. Am i the asshole because my ex scheduled something during MY time with MY kids? How is it my fault that i'm only using my right to spend time with them? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about custody and a vacation. The parent (author) has a 50/50 custody arrangement and refused to switch weeks so their kids could go to Disneyland with the ex during the author's scheduled time. The kids are upset, the ex is mad, and the author is defending their decision.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the custody agreement. They have a 50/50 split with no switching unless agreed. The author hasn't switched before, even when the ex asked. The ex's parents have a reunion scheduled during the author's time. The author says it's their time, so they won't give it up. The ex is trying to make the kids think the author is the bad guy for not allowing the vacation.\n\nThe author claims they're not trying to get back at the ex, just following the custody terms. The kids are upset because they were told they can't go to Disneyland, and the son is not talking. The daughter is crying. The ex is using the kids to make the author look bad.\n\nHmm, the key points here are the custody agreement and the ex's actions. The author followed the agreement by not switching weeks. The ex is trying to change the schedule without agreement. The author is enforcing their right to have the kids during their time. But the kids are caught in the middle, which is sad. The ex is manipulating the kids to paint the author as the villain. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they did follow the custody terms. The problem is the ex breaking the agreement by trying to take the kids during the author's time. The author is standing by the agreement, which is their right. However, the kids are suffering because of the conflict. The ex's actions are undermining the agreement. The author might not be in the wrong legally, but emotionally, the kids are hurt. Still, the author is within their rights. Maybe the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong. But the user initially thought the author was in the wrong. Need to check if there's any nuance I'm missing. The ex's parents can't reschedule, but was the ex supposed to consider that? The agreement was not to switch unless extremely important. The author says they've never switched. So the author's stance is consistent. So, B is correct.\n"
