My son wont even talk to me and my daughter is crying all the time. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA little backstory. Me and my ex divorced shortly after my daughter was born. I blame him for it and he blames me. I won't go into detail here. We ended up with a 50/50 custody agreement switching every other week. While this was 8 years ago we're still not on good terms. We rarely ever talk to each other outside of the kids and i'm perfectly fine with that. One thing we have agreed on since the beginning though is that we don't plan things on days that aren't ours. And unless it's extremely important we don't \"switch\" days or weeks. In the 8 years since we've been divorced I have never asked him to have the kids on a day that isn't mine and I've never given him one of my days even if he begged. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, last week my ex contacted me and told me the \"good\" news. His parents are hosting a week long family reunion in the summer at Disneyland and he want's to take the kids. Well, the problem is that it's on one of my weeks. He asked me to let the kids stay with him that week or to switch a week with me and I shot him down. It's my week with them and I get to spend it with them. I told him if it's so important to him to reschedule but he claims his parents can't do that and this is the only week that the whole family can go and he told me that I need to \"think of them\". I told him \"tough luck\" and hung up on him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this last Sunday when my ex dropped the kids off with me my son refused to talk to me at all and my daughter wouldn't even look at me. When I asked my ex what was wrong he refused to talk to me, only saying \"ask them\" in a snarky tone before leaving. When I asked my daughter what was wrong she burst into tears and said that i was \"not letting daddy take them to Disneyland\". Asking my son (who still refuses to talk to me) it turns out that my ex told them I was not letting them go to Disneyland with him. He's trying to paint me as the bad guy. I sat both of them down last night to talk to them and explain it's my week with them but they refused to listen to me. My daughter just cried and my son told me i'm only doing this to get back at my ex.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm not though. I think its unfair for him to do this when his parents scheduled it during my time with them. I demanded an apology from my ex and him to set things straight but he refuses, and his last text to me being \"can't tell them the truth cause they already know it\". \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm so pissed right now. Am i the asshole because my ex scheduled something during MY time with MY kids? How is it my fault that i'm only using my right to spend time with them? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author did something wrong by not letting their kids go on a vacation with the ex during their scheduled time. Let me break down the details.\n\nFirst, the author and ex have a 50/50 custody agreement, switching every other week. They've agreed not to plan things on days that aren't theirs, and not to switch weeks unless it's extremely important. The author has stuck to this agreement for 8 years, never giving up their time. Now the ex wants to take the kids to Disneyland during the author's week. The author refused, thinking it's unfair since the ex's parents scheduled it during their time. The kids are upset, thinking the author is blocking them from going. The ex is using this to paint the author as the bad guy.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the custody agreement and the kids' feelings. The author is following the agreement they've had for years, which the user says they both agreed on. The ex is trying to change the schedule without switching weeks, which the author refused. The author's reasoning is that it's their time with the kids, and they have a right to it. The kids are upset because they want to go with the ex, but they might not understand the custody arrangement. The ex is not following the agreed-upon rules by trying to take the kids during the author's week without a switch. \n\nBut wait, maybe there's a middle ground. Could the author have considered switching a week if it's important? The author says they've never given up their weeks, even if begged. The ex's parents' event is a week-long reunion, which might be a significant event. However, the author's stance is that unless it's extremely important, they won't switch. The ex claims it's important, but the author doesn't think it's valid because the ex's parents scheduled it during their time. \n\nThe children's emotional response is also a factor. The son is refusing to talk, the daughter is crying, and they believe the author is blocking them. The author tried to explain it's their week, but the kids are taking the ex's side. However, the author isn't to blame for the kids' initial confusion, as the ex is the one who told them the author is the bad guy. \n\nIn terms of legal and ethical standpoint, the author's actions seem to align with the custody agreement. The ex is trying to bend the rules for a vacation, which the author isn't obligated to do. The kids' upset is a result of the ex's actions in framing the situation. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. They upheld the agreement, and the ex is the one violating it. The kids' anger stems from the ex's manipulation. Therefore, the answer should be B (Not the Asshole).\n"
