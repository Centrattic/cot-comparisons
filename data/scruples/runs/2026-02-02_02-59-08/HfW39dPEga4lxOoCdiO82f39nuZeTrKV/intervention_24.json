My son wont even talk to me and my daughter is crying all the time. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA little backstory. Me and my ex divorced shortly after my daughter was born. I blame him for it and he blames me. I won't go into detail here. We ended up with a 50/50 custody agreement switching every other week. While this was 8 years ago we're still not on good terms. We rarely ever talk to each other outside of the kids and i'm perfectly fine with that. One thing we have agreed on since the beginning though is that we don't plan things on days that aren't ours. And unless it's extremely important we don't \"switch\" days or weeks. In the 8 years since we've been divorced I have never asked him to have the kids on a day that isn't mine and I've never given him one of my days even if he begged. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, last week my ex contacted me and told me the \"good\" news. His parents are hosting a week long family reunion in the summer at Disneyland and he want's to take the kids. Well, the problem is that it's on one of my weeks. He asked me to let the kids stay with him that week or to switch a week with me and I shot him down. It's my week with them and I get to spend it with them. I told him if it's so important to him to reschedule but he claims his parents can't do that and this is the only week that the whole family can go and he told me that I need to \"think of them\". I told him \"tough luck\" and hung up on him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this last Sunday when my ex dropped the kids off with me my son refused to talk to me at all and my daughter wouldn't even look at me. When I asked my ex what was wrong he refused to talk to me, only saying \"ask them\" in a snarky tone before leaving. When I asked my daughter what was wrong she burst into tears and said that i was \"not letting daddy take them to Disneyland\". Asking my son (who still refuses to talk to me) it turns out that my ex told them I was not letting them go to Disneyland with him. He's trying to paint me as the bad guy. I sat both of them down last night to talk to them and explain it's my week with them but they refused to listen to me. My daughter just cried and my son told me i'm only doing this to get back at my ex.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm not though. I think its unfair for him to do this when his parents scheduled it during my time with them. I demanded an apology from my ex and him to set things straight but he refuses, and his last text to me being \"can't tell them the truth cause they already know it\". \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm so pissed right now. Am i the asshole because my ex scheduled something during MY time with MY kids? How is it my fault that i'm only using my right to spend time with them? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about custody and vacation plans. The parent (author) has a 50/50 custody arrangement, switching every other week. The ex wants to take the kids to Disneyland during the author's week, so the author refuses to give up their time. The kids are upset, and the ex is painting the author as the bad guy.\n\nFirst, the custody agreement is 50/50, and they've had this arrangement for 8 years without switching days unless extremely important. The author hasn't given up their days before, even when begged. This time, the ex wants to switch a week for a family reunion. The author says no, leading to conflict with the kids.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the custody terms, the history of not switching unless necessary, and the current refusal to switch. The author is standing by the agreement they've had for years. The ex is trying to change it now for a vacation, but the author isn't obligated to do so. The kids are upset because they were promised by the ex, but the author is the one following the agreed terms.\n\nHowever, maybe the ex had some valid reason? The ex's parents are hosting the reunion, and it's a big family event. But the author's argument is that it's scheduled during the author's time, so the ex should have rescheduled or found another solution. Also, the author mentions that the ex is trying to make them the bad guy, which could be a factor in the kids' perspective.\n\nBut the author isn't violating the custody agreement by not switching. They've been consistent. The ex is asking for a switch, but the author has the right to their time. The kids might not understand the custody arrangements, especially the son thinking it's a revenge move. The author's anger at the ex's manipulation is understandable.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for adhering to the custody agreement. The problem is on the ex's side for trying to push the switch without the author's consent. The kids are caught in the middle, but the author's actions are within their rights. Therefore, the answer should be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
