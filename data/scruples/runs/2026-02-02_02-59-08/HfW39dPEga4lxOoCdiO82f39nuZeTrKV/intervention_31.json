My son wont even talk to me and my daughter is crying all the time. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA little backstory. Me and my ex divorced shortly after my daughter was born. I blame him for it and he blames me. I won't go into detail here. We ended up with a 50/50 custody agreement switching every other week. While this was 8 years ago we're still not on good terms. We rarely ever talk to each other outside of the kids and i'm perfectly fine with that. One thing we have agreed on since the beginning though is that we don't plan things on days that aren't ours. And unless it's extremely important we don't \"switch\" days or weeks. In the 8 years since we've been divorced I have never asked him to have the kids on a day that isn't mine and I've never given him one of my days even if he begged. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, last week my ex contacted me and told me the \"good\" news. His parents are hosting a week long family reunion in the summer at Disneyland and he want's to take the kids. Well, the problem is that it's on one of my weeks. He asked me to let the kids stay with him that week or to switch a week with me and I shot him down. It's my week with them and I get to spend it with them. I told him if it's so important to him to reschedule but he claims his parents can't do that and this is the only week that the whole family can go and he told me that I need to \"think of them\". I told him \"tough luck\" and hung up on him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this last Sunday when my ex dropped the kids off with me my son refused to talk to me at all and my daughter wouldn't even look at me. When I asked my ex what was wrong he refused to talk to me, only saying \"ask them\" in a snarky tone before leaving. When I asked my daughter what was wrong she burst into tears and said that i was \"not letting daddy take them to Disneyland\". Asking my son (who still refuses to talk to me) it turns out that my ex told them I was not letting them go to Disneyland with him. He's trying to paint me as the bad guy. I sat both of them down last night to talk to them and explain it's my week with them but they refused to listen to me. My daughter just cried and my son told me i'm only doing this to get back at my ex.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm not though. I think its unfair for him to do this when his parents scheduled it during my time with them. I demanded an apology from my ex and him to set things straight but he refuses, and his last text to me being \"can't tell them the truth cause they already know it\". \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm so pissed right now. Am i the asshole because my ex scheduled something during MY time with MY kids? How is it my fault that i'm only using my right to spend time with them? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a divorced couple with a 50/50 custody agreement. The author is refusing to let the kids go on a vacation with the ex during the author's scheduled time, leading to the kids being upset.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The custody agreement states they don't plan things on days that aren't theirs and don't switch weeks unless extremely important. The author has never given up their days, even when begged. The ex wanted to take the kids to Disneyland during the author's week, but the author refused. The ex didn't reschedule, and now the kids are upset, thinking the author is the bad guy.\n\nThe author argues that it's their week and it's unfair for the ex to schedule a family event during that time. They think it's not their fault for upholding their custody rights. The kids, however, are taking the ex's side, which is causing conflict.\n\nI need to consider legal and moral aspects. Legally, the custody agreement is in place, so the author is following it. The ex didn't request a switch unless there's an extreme situation, which the author doesn't consider this to be. The ex's parents couldn't reschedule, but the author isn't required to accommodate non-emergency changes.\n\nMoral-wise, the kids are upset and feel they can't go. The author is prioritizing their time, but maybe the kids' wishes should be considered. However, the ex is using the kids to undermine the author, which isn't fair. The author might be in the right to stand by the agreement, but the kids' feelings are hurt.\n\nThe author is being accused of being the bad guy, but if the custody agreement is clear and the ex didn't follow the terms, the author isn't wrong. However, maybe the author should have considered the kids' feelings more, but the ex's refusal to reschedule or explain properly might be the real issue. \n\nIn conclusion, the author is not violating the custody agreement and is standing by their rights. The ex is not following the agreement by not rescheduling and is manipulating the kids. Therefore, the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
