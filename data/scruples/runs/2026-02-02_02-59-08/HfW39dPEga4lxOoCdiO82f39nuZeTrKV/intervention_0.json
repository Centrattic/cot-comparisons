My son wont even talk to me and my daughter is crying all the time. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA little backstory. Me and my ex divorced shortly after my daughter was born. I blame him for it and he blames me. I won't go into detail here. We ended up with a 50/50 custody agreement switching every other week. While this was 8 years ago we're still not on good terms. We rarely ever talk to each other outside of the kids and i'm perfectly fine with that. One thing we have agreed on since the beginning though is that we don't plan things on days that aren't ours. And unless it's extremely important we don't \"switch\" days or weeks. In the 8 years since we've been divorced I have never asked him to have the kids on a day that isn't mine and I've never given him one of my days even if he begged. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, last week my ex contacted me and told me the \"good\" news. His parents are hosting a week long family reunion in the summer at Disneyland and he want's to take the kids. Well, the problem is that it's on one of my weeks. He asked me to let the kids stay with him that week or to switch a week with me and I shot him down. It's my week with them and I get to spend it with them. I told him if it's so important to him to reschedule but he claims his parents can't do that and this is the only week that the whole family can go and he told me that I need to \"think of them\". I told him \"tough luck\" and hung up on him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this last Sunday when my ex dropped the kids off with me my son refused to talk to me at all and my daughter wouldn't even look at me. When I asked my ex what was wrong he refused to talk to me, only saying \"ask them\" in a snarky tone before leaving. When I asked my daughter what was wrong she burst into tears and said that i was \"not letting daddy take them to Disneyland\". Asking my son (who still refuses to talk to me) it turns out that my ex told them I was not letting them go to Disneyland with him. He's trying to paint me as the bad guy. I sat both of them down last night to talk to them and explain it's my week with them but they refused to listen to me. My daughter just cried and my son told me i'm only doing this to get back at my ex.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm not though. I think its unfair for him to do this when his parents scheduled it during my time with them. I demanded an apology from my ex and him to set things straight but he refuses, and his last text to me being \"can't tell them the truth cause they already know it\". \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm so pissed right now. Am i the asshole because my ex scheduled something during MY time with MY kids? How is it my fault that i'm only using my right to spend time with them? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is the asshole for not letting their kids go on vacation with their ex during their scheduled custody week.\n\nFirst, the key points from the backstory: 50/50 custody, established agreement that they don't switch weeks unless necessary. The ex wants to take the kids to Disneyland during the author's week, so he asked to switch weeks. The author refused, thinking it's their time. The kids are upset, and the ex didn't explain properly, making the kids think the author is blocking them without reason.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that the ex scheduled the trip during their week and isn't willing to reschedule, so they stood their ground. The ex didn't want to switch and now the kids are upset because they think the author is the bad guy. The author is frustrated and wants to know if they're wrong.\n\nNow, the user initially thought the author is in the wrong but wants another opinion. I need to consider custody agreements and the kids' well-being. In a 50/50 split, both parents have the right to their scheduled time. If the ex wanted to make exceptions, he should have planned around the custody schedule. The author isn't violating any agreement by not switching. However, maybe the kids feel they're missing out, but the author's stance is about respecting their own custody time. The ex didn't communicate well, leading the kids to misunderstand. \n\nIs the author wrong? The author is following the agreed terms, so technically, no. But maybe there's a way to be more considerate. However, the ex didn't try to reschedule, which could be his fault. The author's refusal isn't against the custody agreement. So the answer would lean towards the author not being in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
