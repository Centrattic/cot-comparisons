My son wont even talk to me and my daughter is crying all the time. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA little backstory. Me and my ex divorced shortly after my daughter was born. I blame him for it and he blames me. I won't go into detail here. We ended up with a 50/50 custody agreement switching every other week. While this was 8 years ago we're still not on good terms. We rarely ever talk to each other outside of the kids and i'm perfectly fine with that. One thing we have agreed on since the beginning though is that we don't plan things on days that aren't ours. And unless it's extremely important we don't \"switch\" days or weeks. In the 8 years since we've been divorced I have never asked him to have the kids on a day that isn't mine and I've never given him one of my days even if he begged. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, last week my ex contacted me and told me the \"good\" news. His parents are hosting a week long family reunion in the summer at Disneyland and he want's to take the kids. Well, the problem is that it's on one of my weeks. He asked me to let the kids stay with him that week or to switch a week with me and I shot him down. It's my week with them and I get to spend it with them. I told him if it's so important to him to reschedule but he claims his parents can't do that and this is the only week that the whole family can go and he told me that I need to \"think of them\". I told him \"tough luck\" and hung up on him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this last Sunday when my ex dropped the kids off with me my son refused to talk to me at all and my daughter wouldn't even look at me. When I asked my ex what was wrong he refused to talk to me, only saying \"ask them\" in a snarky tone before leaving. When I asked my daughter what was wrong she burst into tears and said that i was \"not letting daddy take them to Disneyland\". Asking my son (who still refuses to talk to me) it turns out that my ex told them I was not letting them go to Disneyland with him. He's trying to paint me as the bad guy. I sat both of them down last night to talk to them and explain it's my week with them but they refused to listen to me. My daughter just cried and my son told me i'm only doing this to get back at my ex.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm not though. I think its unfair for him to do this when his parents scheduled it during my time with them. I demanded an apology from my ex and him to set things straight but he refuses, and his last text to me being \"can't tell them the truth cause they already know it\". \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm so pissed right now. Am i the asshole because my ex scheduled something during MY time with MY kids? How is it my fault that i'm only using my right to spend time with them? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not allowing their kids to go on a vacation with their ex during the author's custody week. The key points here are the custody agreement and the communication issues.\n\nFirst, the divorce happened 8 years ago with a 50/50 custody arrangement. Both parents have agreed not to plan things on each other's days unless it's extremely important. The author has never given up their time before, and this time they refused to switch weeks for the Disneyland trip. The ex scheduled it during the author's week, and the author is standing by their schedule. \n\nThe kids are upset because the ex is framing the author as the bad guy. The author is getting blamed for not allowing the trip, but according to the custody agreement, the time is theirs. The ex isn't following the prior agreement by scheduling something during the author's time without a switch, which the author refused. The author also mentions that the ex's parents can't reschedule, but the author isn't responsible for that. \n\nThe author's main argument is about upholding the custody agreement. They're not giving up their time, which they've consistently done before. The ex is trying to manipulate the kids by making it seem like the author is being unfair. The author is trying to correct the kids but is met with resistance. \n\nConsidering legal custody terms, the author has the right to decide during their time. The ex didn't follow the agreed-upon rules by not getting a switch, and the author is enforcing that. The ex's actions seem like they're trying to undermine the authority, leading to the kids feeling caught in the middle. \n\nWhile the kids are upset, the author isn't in the wrong for sticking to their custody agreement. The ex's approach is problematic because they scheduled without proper communication and switched blame. The author isn't being unreasonable here. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
