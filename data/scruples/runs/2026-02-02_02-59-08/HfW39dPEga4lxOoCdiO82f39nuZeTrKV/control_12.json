My son wont even talk to me and my daughter is crying all the time. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA little backstory. Me and my ex divorced shortly after my daughter was born. I blame him for it and he blames me. I won't go into detail here. We ended up with a 50/50 custody agreement switching every other week. While this was 8 years ago we're still not on good terms. We rarely ever talk to each other outside of the kids and i'm perfectly fine with that. One thing we have agreed on since the beginning though is that we don't plan things on days that aren't ours. And unless it's extremely important we don't \"switch\" days or weeks. In the 8 years since we've been divorced I have never asked him to have the kids on a day that isn't mine and I've never given him one of my days even if he begged. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, last week my ex contacted me and told me the \"good\" news. His parents are hosting a week long family reunion in the summer at Disneyland and he want's to take the kids. Well, the problem is that it's on one of my weeks. He asked me to let the kids stay with him that week or to switch a week with me and I shot him down. It's my week with them and I get to spend it with them. I told him if it's so important to him to reschedule but he claims his parents can't do that and this is the only week that the whole family can go and he told me that I need to \"think of them\". I told him \"tough luck\" and hung up on him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this last Sunday when my ex dropped the kids off with me my son refused to talk to me at all and my daughter wouldn't even look at me. When I asked my ex what was wrong he refused to talk to me, only saying \"ask them\" in a snarky tone before leaving. When I asked my daughter what was wrong she burst into tears and said that i was \"not letting daddy take them to Disneyland\". Asking my son (who still refuses to talk to me) it turns out that my ex told them I was not letting them go to Disneyland with him. He's trying to paint me as the bad guy. I sat both of them down last night to talk to them and explain it's my week with them but they refused to listen to me. My daughter just cried and my son told me i'm only doing this to get back at my ex.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm not though. I think its unfair for him to do this when his parents scheduled it during my time with them. I demanded an apology from my ex and him to set things straight but he refuses, and his last text to me being \"can't tell them the truth cause they already know it\". \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm so pissed right now. Am i the asshole because my ex scheduled something during MY time with MY kids? How is it my fault that i'm only using my right to spend time with them? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story (AITA) is in the wrong. The situation is about a custody arrangement where the parent (author) and their ex have a 50/50 split. The ex wants to take the kids to Disneyland during the author's week, but the author refuses to switch weeks. The kids are upset because they think the author is blocking them from going.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the key points. The custody agreement has been in place for 8 years, and they agreed not to plan things on each other's days unless it's extremely important. The author hasn't switched weeks before, even when asked. This time, the ex's parents have a family reunion at Disneyland, which is during the author's week. The author says no, leading to conflict with the kids.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. Legally, if the custody agreement is clear and they have a 50/50 split with no prior flexibility, the author might be within their rights to stick to their schedule. The ex is asking to switch weeks, but the author has refused in the past. However, the ex is using the kids to get back at the author, which is problematic.\n\nFrom a parental standpoint, the author's main concern is their time with the kids, which is their right under the custody agreement. But the kids are upset because they feel they can't go on vacation with their other parent. The author's refusal might be seen as prioritizing their own time over the kids' wishes, but the ex might be manipulating the situation. \n\nThe ex's behavior is questionable. They are using the kids to pressure the author and not being honest about the situation. The author tried to explain, but the ex refused to apologize. The kids are caught in the middle, which is hard for them.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the custody agreement allows no switching without mutual agreement, the author isn't violating anything. The ex is the one who scheduled the trip during the author's week, which might be the real issue. The author is standing by their rights as per the agreement. However, maybe there's a way to be more flexible for the kids, but the author has been consistent. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's refusal could be seen as being rigid, but given the history of conflict, maybe they need to maintain boundaries. The ex's actions seem more manipulative, so the blame isn't on the author. \n\nConsidering all that, the answer is likely B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The author is upholding their custody rights, and the ex is the one causing conflict. The kids are being used as pawns, but the author isn't at fault here.\n"
