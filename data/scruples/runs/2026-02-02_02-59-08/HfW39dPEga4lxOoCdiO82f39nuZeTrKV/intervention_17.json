My son wont even talk to me and my daughter is crying all the time. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA little backstory. Me and my ex divorced shortly after my daughter was born. I blame him for it and he blames me. I won't go into detail here. We ended up with a 50/50 custody agreement switching every other week. While this was 8 years ago we're still not on good terms. We rarely ever talk to each other outside of the kids and i'm perfectly fine with that. One thing we have agreed on since the beginning though is that we don't plan things on days that aren't ours. And unless it's extremely important we don't \"switch\" days or weeks. In the 8 years since we've been divorced I have never asked him to have the kids on a day that isn't mine and I've never given him one of my days even if he begged. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, last week my ex contacted me and told me the \"good\" news. His parents are hosting a week long family reunion in the summer at Disneyland and he want's to take the kids. Well, the problem is that it's on one of my weeks. He asked me to let the kids stay with him that week or to switch a week with me and I shot him down. It's my week with them and I get to spend it with them. I told him if it's so important to him to reschedule but he claims his parents can't do that and this is the only week that the whole family can go and he told me that I need to \"think of them\". I told him \"tough luck\" and hung up on him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this last Sunday when my ex dropped the kids off with me my son refused to talk to me at all and my daughter wouldn't even look at me. When I asked my ex what was wrong he refused to talk to me, only saying \"ask them\" in a snarky tone before leaving. When I asked my daughter what was wrong she burst into tears and said that i was \"not letting daddy take them to Disneyland\". Asking my son (who still refuses to talk to me) it turns out that my ex told them I was not letting them go to Disneyland with him. He's trying to paint me as the bad guy. I sat both of them down last night to talk to them and explain it's my week with them but they refused to listen to me. My daughter just cried and my son told me i'm only doing this to get back at my ex.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm not though. I think its unfair for him to do this when his parents scheduled it during my time with them. I demanded an apology from my ex and him to set things straight but he refuses, and his last text to me being \"can't tell them the truth cause they already know it\". \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm so pissed right now. Am i the asshole because my ex scheduled something during MY time with MY kids? How is it my fault that i'm only using my right to spend time with them? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a custody dispute where the parent (the author) is refusing to let their kids go on a vacation with the ex during their scheduled time. The author has a 50/50 custody arrangement and the ex wants to switch weeks for a family reunion at Disneyland. The author says no, leading to the kids being upset and the ex not apologizing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The custody agreement states they don't plan things on days that aren't theirs unless it's extremely important. The author hasn't switched weeks before, which shows they follow the agreement strictly. The ex is asking to switch, but the author is within their rights to say no. Legally, the author isn't violating anything by not giving up their scheduled time.\n\nNext, the emotional impact on the kids. The kids are upset because they can't go on the trip. The author explains that it's their time, but the kids might feel it's unfair. However, the author isn't the one who scheduled the trip during the other parent's time. The ex's parents made the arrangement, so maybe the ex should have communicated better. \n\nThe author's ex is portrayed as trying to manipulate the situation, making the author the bad guy. The author did explain the situation to the kids, but they might not be receiving that message clearly if the ex isn't helping. The author's stance is about upholding the custody agreement, which is their right.\n\nHowever, maybe there's a middle ground. Could the author have been more flexible? For example, maybe adjusting a week if possible. But the ex's parents can't reschedule, so the author isn't at fault there. The ex is the one who approached the author for a switch, and the author declined. \n\nThe kids are reacting emotionally, which is understandable, but the author isn't obligated to let them go during their time. The ex's refusal to clarify the truth with the kids is part of the problem. The author isn't the one breaking the agreement. \n\nSo, putting it all together: The author is following the custody agreement, the ex is the one who initiated the switch request, and the kids' upset is due to the ex's actions. The author isn't in the wrong here because they're upholding their custody rights. The answer should be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
