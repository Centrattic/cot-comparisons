I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a Domme who didn't respect the safe word during a session. The user paid a deposit, set limits, and had a safe word agreement. The Domme ignored the safe word after the user dropped the ball, causing injury. Then the user didn't pay the remaining balance and the Domme is threatening to tell others about it.\n\nFirst, the safe word is crucial in such activities. It's supposed to be a clear signal to stop immediately. The user followed the agreed-upon method (dropping the ball), but the Domme continued, which is a breach of the agreed terms. That seems like a clear violation of trust and safety. The user then decided not to pay because the Domme didn't adhere to the safety protocol, leading to harm. \n\nThe Domme's argument is that she's losing money because of the broken equipment and non-payment. However, the user's health and safety were compromised. The friend (another Domme) says the user is wrong because she pushed limits and it's the user's fault. But if the Domme ignored the safe word, which was supposed to prevent exceeding the user's limits, then the responsibility lies with her. \n\nLegally, if there was a contract or explicit agreement that the safe word would be honored, the Domme's actions could be a breach. Ethically, the user's right to safety is paramount. The user's decision not to pay could be justified as the service didn't meet agreed terms. But there's also the issue of the deposit and the remaining payment. However, since the Domme didn't fulfill the service properly, the user might not be obligated to pay the rest.\n\nSo, considering all that, the user isn't in the wrong because the Domme violated the agreed-upon safety measures, leading to harm. The user's priority was their health, which is the most important aspect here. The Domme's threats about the community might be intimidating, but the user's actions were in self-defense and to protect their well-being.\n"
