I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break down this situation to figure out if the author is in the wrong. The user is asking about not paying a Domme after she ignored their safe word during a ballbusting session. \n\nFirst, the setup: The author paid a $50 deposit for a $350 session, set limits, and agreed on a safe word system involving holding a ball. The Domme went beyond the agreed medium power, leading to severe pain and the author dropping the ball (the safe word). Despite this, she continued for three more kicks, causing the author to nearly pass out. They broke the restraints and then the Domme started yelling about the broken equipment and demanding payment.\n\nNow, the key points to consider. The safe word is a critical agreement in BDSM practices to ensure safety and consent. If the Domme ignored the safe word, that's a serious breach of trust and protocol. The author's main argument is that the Domme didn't respect their boundaries, leading to injury and a need to go to the hospital. The friend who's also a Domme argues that the author is an asshole for not paying, implying that the Domme was just pushing limits as part of the role.\n\nBut wait, in consensual activities, especially those involving physical contact, the safe word is meant to be an absolute stop. If the Domme didn't adhere to it, she violated the agreed terms. The author's non-payment could be justified as a response to her failure to follow safety protocols. However, some might argue that the author still agreed to the session and should pay regardless of the outcome, even if they felt wronged.\n\nBut another angle: The Domme might have misinterpreted the safe word system. Maybe the author dropping the ball wasn't clear communication. However, the scenario states that the safe word was dropping the ball, so the Domme should have been aware and responded immediately. Her continued actions after the safe word was triggered indicate negligence.\n\nThe author's refusal to pay could be seen as a consequence of the Domme's actions, especially if she endangered them. However, in transactional or professional contexts, non-payment might lead to conflicts. The friend's perspective that the author should pay because the Domme was just doing her job by pushing limits is problematic because pushing beyond agreed limits is a safety issue. \n\nAlso, the author ended up in the hospital, which is a significant outcome. If the Domme's actions caused harm, there's a possible legal or ethical issue here. The author might have a case if the Domme didn't follow the agreed safety measures, but in some communities, the expectation is that you pay for the session regardless of the experience unless there's a breach of contract or illegal behavior. \n\nBut the question is about being in the wrong, not legal right. The author's actions were a direct response to the Domme ignoring the safe word and causing harm. The Domme then demanded payment while being confrontational. From a community standpoint, some might say the author should pay and report the incident instead, but the immediate reaction of refusing payment due to the violation is understandable. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the Domme's actions were the primary issue. The author communicated their limits upfront, set a clear safe word, and the Domme failed to honor it. The author's breaking the restraints to protect themselves is a self-defense measure. The non-payment is a choice made after being harmed, which could be justified as a refusal to support someone who endangered them. \n\nHowever, the friend's argument is that the author didn't pay for the service and damaged equipment. But the service was compromised by the Domme's actions, so the author isn't obligated to pay. The friend's stance might be from a different perspective where the session was completed, but if the session was cut short due to the Domme's negligence, the author's refusal to pay the remaining $300 is reasonable. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The Domme failed to follow the agreed-upon safety protocols, leading to harm. The author's response was a reaction to that breach. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
