I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author paid $350 for a session with a Domme, gave a $50 deposit upfront. They agreed on a safe word system where if the ball is dropped, the Domme should stop immediately. During the session, the Domme went beyond the agreed limits, kept going after the safe word was triggered, causing the author severe pain and injury. The author then refuses to pay the remaining $300 because the Domme didn't follow the safety agreement and even accused them of damaging her equipment. The friend (who's also a Domme) says the author is an asshole for not paying.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the consensual dynamics in BDSM. Safe words are crucial; they're supposed to be respected unconditionally. The Domme here ignored the safe word, which is a serious breach of trust and safety. The author's main argument is that the Domme violated the agreed-upon safety measures, leading to harm. The author didn't pay the rest because the service wasn't delivered as per the agreement. The Domme's friend argues that the author still should pay because it's part of the deal, but that seems to ignore the fundamental safety issues and breach of contract.\n\nBDSM practices require mutual trust and clear boundaries. If the Domme didn't adhere to the agreed terms, especially regarding the safe word, that's a problem. The author's refusal to pay might be justified because the service was not provided in the agreed manner. However, usually, pre-agreed payments are expected regardless of the session's outcome unless there's a breach. But in this case, the breach was severe. The author also got injured, which adds a layer of negligence. The Domme's reaction, including accusing the author of damaging equipment and threatening to ruin their reputation, might be seen as trying to cover up her own mistake.\n\nIn typical contracts, if one party breaches the agreement, the other might not be obligated to fulfill their part. The author could argue that the Domme's violation of the safe word terms nullifies the payment requirement. Additionally, the author's health and safety are paramount. The Domme's actions were negligent, and the author's refusal to pay is a response to that negligence. The friend's opinion that the author is an asshole might be based on a different perspective but doesn't justify the Domme's actions.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the Domme was in the wrong for ignoring the safe word and causing harm. The author's refusal to pay is a reasonable response to a breach of trust and safety. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
