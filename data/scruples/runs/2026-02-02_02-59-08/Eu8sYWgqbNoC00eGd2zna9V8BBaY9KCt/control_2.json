I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author paid $50 deposit for a session with a Domme (a dominant woman in a BDSM context). The Domme didn't ask for the money upfront, which is a bit unusual, maybe a red flag? The session was supposed to be light to medium ballbusting, which the author specified their limits for. They set up a safe word system where if he dropped the ball, she'd stop. But during the session, she went way beyond his limits, kept kicking even after he dropped the ball, causing him severe pain and injury. He then didn't pay the remaining $300, and she's threatening to expose him in the community for non-payment.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the safety protocols in BDSM. Safe words are crucial. If the Domme ignored the safe word, that's a major violation. The author's safety was compromised. Even if she's experienced, ignoring the safe word is a big no-no. The Domme's actions led to him needing medical attention, which is serious.\n\nThen there's the payment aspect. He didn't pay because she violated the agreed-upon terms. The Domme, on the other hand, is claiming that the author broke her equipment (the restraints) and that he should still pay. But in a service contract, if the service provider doesn't deliver as agreed (i.e., not respecting the safe word, causing harm), the client isn't obligated to pay. Especially since he was injured, that might even be a case of negligence or assault, depending on local laws.\n\nThe friend, who's also a domme, says he's an asshole for not paying. But her perspective might be biased, especially if she's part of the same community. It's possible she's more focused on the financial aspect than the safety breach.\n\nLegally, if the Domme caused harm by ignoring safety protocols, the author might have a case for not paying. Ethically, the Domme's actions were wrong, so the author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing his health and not paying for a service that was dangerously performed.\n\nAlso, the fact that she threatened to expose him for non-payment but didn't address her own misconduct (ignoring the safe word, causing injury) shows she's at fault. The author's decision to seek medical help was necessary, and he shouldn't be penalized for that.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The author is not in the wrong. The Domme violated the agreed terms, caused harm, and the author is justified in not paying and seeking medical attention. The friend's judgment is misplaced because she's not considering the safety violation.\n"
