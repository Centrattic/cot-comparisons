I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a Domme (dominant in a BDSM context) who ignored the client's safe word and continued causing pain beyond their agreed limits.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The client paid a deposit, set up a session with specific limits, and established a safe word using a ball. The Domme didn't stop when the safe word was triggered, went beyond the agreed intensity, caused injury, and then expected the remaining payment. The client refused to pay and is being told by the friend that they're in the wrong for not paying and for breaking the Domme's equipment.\n\nFrom a legal perspective, I'm not sure, but ethically, in BDSM communities, there's a strong emphasis on safety, consent, and respecting boundaries. The safe word is a critical part of that. If the Domme ignored the safe word, she violated the agreed terms, which is a serious breach of trust and safety. The client was in pain, had an injury, and rightly refused to pay for a service that wasn't performed as agreed. The Domme's subsequent threats to report the client for non-payment might be seen as unfair because she didn't uphold her end of the agreement.\n\nThe client's friend is a Domme too and is criticizing them, but that's possibly because she's part of the same community and might be prioritizing payment over the client's safety. However, the main issue is the Domme's actions. She didn't stop when the safe word was used, which is a fundamental rule. The client's refusal to pay is a response to her failure to meet the agreed terms. Breaking the restraints was an accident due to the pain, not intentional. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong because the Domme failed to follow the established rules, endangered the client's safety, and then tried to collect payment despite not delivering the agreed service. The client's actions were in self-defense, both physically and in refusing to pay for a substandard and unsafe session.\n"
