I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a paid session with a Domme where the author didn't pay after the Domme ignored their safe word, leading to injury.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author set up a session with clear boundaries, including a safe word method (the ball). They agreed on medium power, but the Domme went beyond that, causing severe pain and injury. Despite dropping the ball (the safe word signal), the Domme continued, leading to the author getting hurt. The author then refused to pay the remaining fee and faced backlash from the Domme. Their friend, another Domme, also supported the author being in the wrong, saying the Domme pushed limits as part of the role.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether the author is responsible for the Domme's actions. The Domme didn't follow the agreed-upon safe word, which is a critical part of consent and safety in such activities. By ignoring the safe word, the Domme violated the terms of the session. The author didn't pay because the service wasn't delivered as agreed and resulted in harm. The friend's perspective that the Domme's actions were part of the experience seems to miss the point of the safe word's purpose, which is to stop when the sub is in pain or distress.\n\nLegally, if someone causes harm by not respecting agreed-upon boundaries, they could be liable. Ethically, the Domme's actions were negligent, and the author's refusal to pay stems from not receiving the agreed service and being injured. The broken restraints were a result of the Domme's excessive force, so the author isn't responsible for that damage. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for withholding payment and seeking medical help.\n"
