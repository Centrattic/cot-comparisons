I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a paid session with a Domme involving ballbusting. The user set up a session with a Domme and agreed on a safe word system using a ball in his hand. During the session, the Domme went beyond his stated limits, causing him severe pain, and he dropped the ball (safe word) but she continued. He then refused to pay, and now his friend, who's also a Domme, says he's an asshole for not paying.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the boundaries agreed upon. The user specified medium power max, but the Domme went beyond that. The safe word was supposed to stop everything immediately. If she ignored the safe word, that's a major breach of trust and safety. In BDSM, respecting safe words is crucial. If she didn't honor it, she's at fault for endangering him.\n\nThen there's the financial aspect. He paid a deposit, but didn't pay the full amount. However, since the service wasn't delivered as agreed (she violated the safe word), he might not be obligated to pay the full amount. Services should meet agreed terms. If the Domme didn't follow the agreed rules, he might have grounds to withhold payment.\n\nThe friend's opinion that he should still pay is conflicting. Maybe she's biased, as she's in the same community. But if the Domme breached the agreement, the user isn't in the wrong for not paying. Also, the Domme's threat to report him for non-payment might be an attempt to pressure him despite her own misconduct.\n\nMedical attention is another point. He went to the hospital due to injury, which shows he was genuinely harmed. The Domme's actions led to a medical emergency, which is serious. She's responsible for the damage to her equipment and his injuries, so she can't just expect payment.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The Domme violated the safe word, caused harm, and the user had a legitimate reason to not pay. Therefore, the user is not in the wrong.\n"
