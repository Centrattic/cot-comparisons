I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a Dominant (Domme) and a submissive (the author) in a role-playing scenario involving ballbusting. The key points are the safe word and payment.\n\nFirst, the author set up a session with the Domme for $350, paid a $50 deposit upfront, and the remaining $300 was to be paid after the session. The safe word was a ball in the hand; if dropped, she should stop. However, when the author dropped the ball (after about 20-30 minutes), indicating he wanted to stop, the Domme continued for three more kicks. The author then broke free, caused damage to the restraints, and left without paying the remaining $300. The Domme threatened to report him to the community, and the author's friend, who's also a Domme, is telling the author he's wrong not to pay.\n\nThe main question is whether the author is in the wrong by not paying. Let's break it down.\n\n1. **Safe Word Agreement**: The safe word system is crucial in such scenarios to ensure safety. The author followed the agreed safe word, but the Domme didn't honor it. This is a serious breach of trust and safety. If she didn't stop when the safe word was triggered, she violated the agreed terms, which could lead to harm. The author's injury (swollen testicles) and needing to go to the hospital indicates that her actions went beyond the agreed limits.\n\n2. **Service Agreement and Payment**: The author didn't pay the full amount upfront, only a deposit. The Domme didn't collect payment before the session. The author didn't receive the full service as agreed because the session was cut short due to the Domme's negligence. If a service is not completed as agreed, the client isn't obligated to pay the full amount. The author was harmed, and the Domme didn't follow the safety protocol, which might make the service not valid anymore.\n\n3. **Damage to Equipment**: The author broke the restraints while trying to protect himself. If the Domme had followed the safe word, this wouldn't have happened. The damage is a result of her actions, so it's her fault, not the author's. Therefore, the author isn't responsible for replacing the restraints.\n\n4. **Threats from the Domme**: The Domme's threats to report the author for non-payment and other actions could be seen as bullying, especially since she's in the wrong. The author's friend, a Domme, is advising him to pay, but that might be biased since she's part of the same community and might prioritize community standards over the client's safety.\n\n5. **Legal and Ethical Considerations**: In many places, contracts (even verbal) exist, but if the service wasn't completed, the client isn't obligated to pay. Also, the Domme's failure to adhere to safety protocols could be a legal issue if the author's injuries were more serious. The ethical obligation here is on the Domme to ensure safety, not the other way around.\n\nConsidering all these points, the author isn't in the wrong. The Domme failed to adhere to the agreed safe word, caused harm, and is now trying to collect payment despite not delivering the service properly. The author's refusal to pay is justified because the service was not completed as agreed and he was harmed. The friend's judgment is likely influenced by community norms, not the actual fault in the situation.\n"
