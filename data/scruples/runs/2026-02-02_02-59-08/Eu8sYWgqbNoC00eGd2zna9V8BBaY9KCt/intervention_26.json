I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a consensual power exchange session with a Domme, but things went wrong when the Domme ignored the safe word.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author paid a deposit, set up a session with specific limits (medium power max), and established a safe word (dropping a ball). However, the Domme exceeded the agreed-upon intensity, leading to significant pain and injury. The author dropped the ball (safe word) but the Domme continued, causing more harm. The author then refused to pay the remaining fee, leading to conflict.\n\nThe author's friend, another Domme, is saying the author is in the wrong for not paying and breaking the equipment. The author argues that the Domme violated the safe word and was negligent.\n\nI need to consider consent and boundaries. In consensual power exchange, the Domme is supposed to respect the sub's limits and safe words. If the safe word was ignored, that's a breach of trust and safety. The author's refusal to pay could be seen as justified if the service wasn't delivered as agreed and caused harm. However, the payment terms are part of the agreement too. If the session was paid for in advance (even partially), there's an expectation of receiving the service. But in this case, the service was not properly delivered because the Domme didn't respect the boundaries, leading to an emergency.\n\nThe author's responsibility might be in not paying, but the Domme's responsibility is in violating the safe word. The safe word is there to prevent harm, so ignoring it is a serious issue. The author's physical harm and the need for medical attention suggest negligence on the Domme's part. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong for not paying because the service was harmful and against the agreed terms. The Domme should have stopped upon the safe word being triggered. So the answer would be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
