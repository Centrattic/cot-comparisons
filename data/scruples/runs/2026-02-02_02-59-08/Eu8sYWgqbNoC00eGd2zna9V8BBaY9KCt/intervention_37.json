I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a person who paid for a session with a Domme, who ignored their safe word, leading to injury. The author didn't pay the remaining $300 and is now being criticized by the Domme and a friend.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The Domme didn't ask for payment upfront, which is unusual but not necessarily wrong. The client set a safe word (dropping a ball) which the Domme ignored, leading to the client dropping the ball and still being hit. The client then left without paying the remaining fee. The Domme claims that the client pushed limits and damaged equipment, thus expecting payment.\n\nFrom a legal perspective, services were provided, so the client might be expected to pay unless there was a breach of contract. The safe word was part of the agreement, and the Domme violated that, making her negligent. The client's refusal to pay could be seen as justified because the service was not performed as agreed. However, in practice, some might argue that the client still received a service (even if harmful) and should pay, but the Domme's negligence is the main issue.\n\nEthically, the Domme's actions were dangerous and disregard for the client's safety is a major issue. The client was harmed, so they have a right to leave and not pay. The friend's criticism is misguided because the Domme breached the agreed-upon safety terms. The client's priority was their health, which is more important than paying for a harmful service.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong because the Domme violated the agreed terms, and the client's refusal to pay is a response to the harm caused. The answer should be B.\n"
