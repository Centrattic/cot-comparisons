I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person (the author of the AskReddit post) is in the wrong for not paying a domme after she ignored his safe word during a session.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author hired a professional domme for a session, agreeing on a safe word system. The safe word was dropping a ball, which would signal her to stop immediately. However, when he dropped the ball, she continued the activity, causing him severe pain and injury. He then left without paying and is facing backlash from the domme community.\n\nKey points to consider:\n\n1. **Consent and Safety Agreements**: In kink and BDSM activities, safe words are crucial for consent and safety. The domme's role is to respect the sub's boundaries. If she ignored the safe word, that's a serious violation of trust and safety.\n\n2. **Professional Responsibility**: As a professional domme, she should be trained to recognize and respond to safe words. Her continued actions after the safe word was triggered could be considered negligence or even assault.\n\n3. **Equipment Damage**: The author broke restraints in distress. While it caused damage, his primary concern was his safety. The domme's reaction to the broken equipment seems to prioritize property over the client's well-being, which is problematic.\n\n4. **Payment Issue**: The author didn't pay the remaining fee. If the service was not completed as agreed (due to her ignoring the safe word), he might not be obligated to pay. However, some might argue that once the session started, payment is still due unless there was a breach on her part.\n\n5. **Legal and Ethical Considerations**: Depending on jurisdiction, there might be legal implications for ignoring a safe word leading to injury. The author's decision to seek medical attention is prudent.\n\nThe friend's opinion that the author should have paid is likely influenced by the domme community's norms, but if the domme violated the agreed terms and caused harm, the author isn't necessarily at fault. The domme's failure to adhere to safety protocols is a significant issue. The author's priority was his health, which is understandable. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Probably not. The domme's actions were the breach here. The author acted in self-defense and was justified in withholding payment due to the professional's failure to uphold safety standards. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
