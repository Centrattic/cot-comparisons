I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So, the user is asking if the person in the story is in the wrong for not paying the Domme after she ignored their safe word.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The person set up a session with a Domme and agreed on limits, including a safe word (dropping a ball) that should stop the session. The Domme, however, continued causing pain beyond what was agreed, even after the safe word was triggered. The person didn't pay the remaining amount and faced backlash from the Domme and a friend who is also a Domme.\n\nNow, considering the context of consensual power exchange in BDSM, there's a lot about communication and safety. The safe word is a critical part of that. If the Domme ignored the safe word, which the sub used, that's a major breach of trust and safety. The Domme also caused injury, leading the person to go to the hospital. \n\nThe Domme expected payment despite not following the agreed terms. Typically, in any service, if the service provider fails to meet the agreed terms or causes harm, the client isn't obligated to pay. Also, the person had to pay for medical attention, which adds to the argument that they weren't at fault.\n\nBut some might say that BDSM activities are inherently risky and that the person should have managed the situation differently. However, the safe word was used, and the Domme didn't respect it. The friend's criticism seems to downplay the violation of the safe word, but that's not a valid excuse for the Domme's actions.\n\nSo, considering all that, the person isn't in the wrong for not paying because the Domme didn't adhere to the agreed safety protocols, causing harm. The answer should be B (No).\n"
