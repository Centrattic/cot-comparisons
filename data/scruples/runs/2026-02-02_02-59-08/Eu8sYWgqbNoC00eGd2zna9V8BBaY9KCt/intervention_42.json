I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the given scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a Domme (dominant) and a sub (submissive) in a ballbusting session. The key points here are the use of a safe word, the escalation beyond agreed limits, and the refusal to pay.\n\nFirst, the author set up a session with a Domme, paid a $50 deposit, and discussed their limits as light to medium. They established a safe word using a ball in their hand. During the session, the Domme went beyond the agreed medium power, even after the sub indicated discomfort by dropping the ball (the safe word). The author then dropped the ball, which was the agreed signal to stop, but the Domme continued for three more kicks. This led to the author experiencing severe pain and injury, which required a hospital visit. The Domme refused to stop, continued the session, and then expected the remaining $300 payment. The author refused to pay, citing the Domme's failure to respect the safe word, and their friend, another Domme, said the author is a jerk for not paying and breaking the equipment.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether the Domme violated the agreed-upon safe word protocol, leading to harm, and if the author was justified in not paying. \n\nIn BDSM communities, there's an emphasis on informed consent, negotiation, and respecting safe words. The safe word is a critical agreement to ensure the sub's safety. If the Domme ignored the safe word, that's a serious breach. The author's friend might argue that the Domme was pushing the sub's limits, but that's only acceptable if the sub hasn't signaled to stop. The Domme's actions led to the sub needing medical attention, which is a red flag. The author not paying could be seen as justified if the Domme didn't honor the safe word, which was the core agreement. However, the author's own account says they agreed to medium power, and the Domme went beyond that. But the Domme's responsibility is to stop when the safe word is triggered. \n\nThe author's friend might be prioritizing the payment and equipment damage over the sub's well-being, which could indicate a power dynamic where the Domme's rules are enforced without considering the sub's safety. The author's refusal to pay is a response to the Domme not respecting the agreed terms, which is a valid reason. The Domme's threat to report the author for non-payment might be an attempt to assert dominance, but that's not a valid reason to ignore a safe word. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for not paying because the Domme violated the agreed safe word. The safe word is a non-negotiable part of the contract for safety. The Domme's continued actions after the safe word was triggered (dropping the ball) caused harm, so the author's right to withhold payment is justified. The friend's opinion might be influenced by being part of the same community and expecting payment regardless, but the author's health should take precedence. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
