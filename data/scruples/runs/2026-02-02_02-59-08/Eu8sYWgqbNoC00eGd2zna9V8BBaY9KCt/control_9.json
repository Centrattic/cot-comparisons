I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not paying the Domme after she ignored his safe word.\n\nFirst, the key points from the story: The Domme agreed to a session with specific limits, including a safe word system using a ball. When the pain exceeded his limits, he dropped the ball as the safe word, but she continued, leading to injury. He didn't pay the remaining money, and she's threatening to blackball him in the community. His friend, another Domme, says he's in the wrong for not paying.\n\nSo, the main issue here is the breach of agreed-upon boundaries. In any consensual power exchange, especially in kink or domination scenarios, safety is paramount. The safe word is a critical part of that agreement. The Domme's actions in continuing after the safe word was triggered could be considered a violation of the terms they set. \n\nThe user also mentions that he had to break a restraint to stop the session, which might indicate that the Domme wasn't monitoring the situation properly. If the safe word was not heeded, the responsibility lies with the Domme for not respecting the agreed-upon safety measures. \n\nFinancial responsibility is another angle. The user paid a deposit, and the full session wasn't completed as agreed. Since the Domme didn't adhere to the safe word protocol, which was a key part of the agreement, the user might not be obligated to pay the remaining amount. The Domme's threats to involve the community could be an overreaction, especially if she was at fault for not following the established rules.\n\nHowever, the user's friend, who is a Domme, argues that the user is in the wrong. But that might be because she's defending the Domme's community standards, maybe expecting payment regardless of the outcome. But in reality, if the session was cut short due to the Domme's negligence, the user isn't obligated to pay. Also, the user's health and safety are more important than the financial aspect here.\n\nSo, considering all factors: the safe word was ignored, leading to injury, the Domme didn't stop when required, and the user left due to her negligence. Therefore, the user isn't in the wrong for withholding payment because the Domme failed to uphold her end of the agreement.\n"
