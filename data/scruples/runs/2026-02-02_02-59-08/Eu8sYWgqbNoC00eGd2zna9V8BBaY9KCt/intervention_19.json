I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a Domme session where the author didn't pay after the Domme ignored his safe word.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The author agreed to a session with a Domme, paid a $50 deposit out of $350 total. They set up a safe word system using a ball in his hand. During the session, the Domme went beyond the agreed medium power, he dropped the ball as a safe word, but she continued, causing him severe pain. He ended up dropping the ball, breaking restraints, and she then berated him for not paying and breaking her equipment.\n\nThe key points here are consent and safety. The safe word is a crucial part of any consensual power exchange arrangement. If the Domme ignored the safe word, she violated the agreed boundaries. However, the author didn't pay the remaining $300 and was planning to report her, according to the story.\n\nThe author's friend, another Domme, argues that the author should have paid regardless. But the author felt the Domme was negligent, leading to injury. The author then didn't pay because the service wasn't as agreed and he was harmed. \n\nNow, considering legal and ethical aspects. Legally, if they had a contract or clear agreement on the safe word and the Domme breached that, the author might have grounds not to pay. Ethically, the Domme's actions could be seen as reckless. However, in such situations, the dynamics can be complex. The author might be in the right for withholding payment if the service was not performed as agreed and caused harm. On the other hand, if the contract was clear and the author didn't follow through on payment, maybe there's a case against him. But given the violation of the safe word and the injury, the author's decision not to pay could be justified as protecting himself and seeking accountability. The friend's opinion that the author is an asshole might not consider the breach of safety protocols.\n\nSo, the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong because the Domme violated the agreed safe word and caused harm, making the service not as contracted. The author withholding payment is a response to a breach of agreement and safety issues.\n"
