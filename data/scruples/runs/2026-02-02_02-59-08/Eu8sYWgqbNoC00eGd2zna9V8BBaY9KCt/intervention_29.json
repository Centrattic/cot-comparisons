I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong after not paying a Domme because she ignored his safe word during a ballbusting session.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The user set up a session, paid a deposit, and communicated his limits for ballbusting\u2014medium max. The Domme agreed but then went beyond that, using harder kneeing and a boot to the balls. He used his safe word (dropping a ball) but she continued the action. After he dropped the ball and showed obvious distress (almost passed out, couldn't breathe), she kept going for three more powerful kicks. He then broke the restraints and managed to get up, but the Domme refused to stop until he paid the remaining $300.\n\nThe author's friend, who is also a Domme, is saying the author is in the wrong because he didn't pay and damaged the equipment, which cost her money. The author is torn because he feels the Domme violated his safe word but is being told he's still responsible.\n\nNow, considering kink dynamics and consent. Safe words are crucial in BDSM practices to ensure the bottom can communicate their limits and stop the activity if needed. The Domme's role is to respect those boundaries. If she ignored the safe word and the clear signs of pain, that's a major issue. The deposit doesn't obligate the author to pay for the entire session, especially if the agreed-upon terms were breached. However, some might argue that the deposit is a binding agreement, and the author should pay regardless, even if the Domme didn't follow the rules. But that's ethically questionable because the Domme violated the explicit consent and safety protocols.\n\nThe damage to the equipment (restraints breaking) was likely due to the Domme pushing beyond the agreed limits, which led to the author's physical distress and subsequent breaking of restraints. In that case, the cost of damaged equipment could be the Domme's responsibility if it was her actions that caused it. The author is then not in the wrong for refusing to pay the remaining $300, as the Domme didn't adhere to the session's agreed terms and caused harm.\n\nThe friend's perspective seems to be that the author should pay because the Domme \"pushed his limits,\" but in reality, the Domme should have respected those limits. If a Domme exceeds the agreed intensity without stopping, that's a violation of consent and the safe word system. The author's decision not to pay is justified because the service provided was unsafe and against the initial agreement. The Domme's threat to report him is also concerning and shows she might be prioritizing money over safety, which is a red flag in the kink community.\n\nSo, the author is not in the wrong (B) because the Domme ignored the safe word and caused harm, making the session dangerous and non-consensual. The author's responsibility ends when the agreed-upon terms are violated, especially with a clear safe word system in place. The deposit was likely a non-refundable payment, but the remaining amount wasn't due if the session wasn't conducted properly. The key issue is the breach of safety and consent, which outweighs the financial obligation in this context.\n"
