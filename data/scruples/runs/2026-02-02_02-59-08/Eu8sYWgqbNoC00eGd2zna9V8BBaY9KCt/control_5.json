I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is at fault for not paying the Domme after she ignored their safe word.\n\nFirst, the setup: the Domme agreed to a session with specific limits\u2014light to medium ballbusting. The safe word was dropping a ball, which the submissive was supposed to stop immediately if that happened. However, during the session, the Domme went beyond the agreed limits, causing severe pain, and ignored the safe word after the ball was dropped. The submissive then left without paying and went to the hospital.\n\nSo, the key points here are the agreed-upon limits and the safe word protocol. The Domme violated the agreed terms by exceeding the intensity and ignoring the safe word. The submissive's primary concern was their safety and health. The Domme's actions led to the need for medical attention, which is a serious issue. \n\nThe Domme's response was to demand payment and threaten the submissive in the domme community. The friend, another domme, said the submissive was in the wrong for not paying, but that's conflicting because the Domme failed to follow the agreed-upon terms. The submissive's decision not to pay is a direct consequence of the Domme's negligence and potential harm caused.\n\nLegally and ethically, if a service provider fails to adhere to the agreed terms and causes harm, the client isn't obligated to pay. The safe word is a critical safety measure, and ignoring it is a breach of any mutual agreement. The Domme's actions could be considered negligent or even abusive, depending on the jurisdiction. The submissive's priority was their health, which is justified. \n\nThe friend's opinion might be influenced by community norms, but that doesn't override the actual agreement and safety concerns. The submissive's right to their body and health supersedes financial obligations when there's a breach of trust and safety. \n\nTherefore, the author is not in the wrong. The Domme's actions were the root cause of the problem, making the author's decision to withhold payment and seek medical help the correct course of action.\n"
