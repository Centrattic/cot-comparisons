I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a paid dominatrix session where the author didn't pay after the Domme ignored his safeword, leading to injury.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author set up a session with a Domme, paid a $50 deposit, and agreed on a safe word using a ball. The Domme was supposed to stop if he dropped the ball. However, during the session, she continued past his limits, caused him significant pain and injury, then expected the remaining $300. He refused to pay and she threatened to report him to the community.\n\nThe author's friend, who's also a domme, says he's an asshole for not paying. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants another opinion.\n\nSo, the main issues here are: Did the Domme breach the agreed terms by ignoring the safe word? Was the author justified in not paying due to the violation and injury? Is the author in the wrong for refusing payment despite the injury?\n\nFrom a contractual standpoint, the service was supposed to follow the agreed limits. The Domme didn't honor the safe word, leading to harm. The author could argue that the service was not provided as agreed, especially since he was injured. However, the friend's argument is that the Domme was just pushing limits, which is part of the dynamic. But pushing beyond agreed limits and ignoring the safe word is a serious breach. Also, the injury aspect complicates things because it's not just about the service not being delivered but also about potential liability for harm caused.\n\nLegally, if the Domme caused injury by breaching the agreed terms, the author might have a case for non-payment due to failure to provide the service as contracted. However, the ethical aspect is also important. The safe word system is crucial in such activities for safety. Ignoring it is a major ethical failure. The author's decision not to pay could be seen as justified because the service was not provided safely and as discussed.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author should have paid because the Domme provided the service, even if it was beyond the agreed limits. But the injury and violation of the safe word are significant. The Domme's actions could be considered negligence or even assault, depending on jurisdiction. The author's right to refuse payment in such a case might be valid, especially if there's a claim for damages or injury.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author is not in the wrong for not paying because the Domme violated the agreed terms and caused harm. The friend's judgment that he's a douche is misplaced because the Domme failed in her duty to adhere to the safety protocols. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
