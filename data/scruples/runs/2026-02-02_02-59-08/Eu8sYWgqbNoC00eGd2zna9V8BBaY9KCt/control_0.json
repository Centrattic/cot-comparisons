I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story (the author) is at fault here. The situation involves a paid session with a Domme (a dominant in a BDSM context), and the key issue is the Domme ignoring the safe word.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the basics of BDSM safety. Safe words are crucial in any consensual power exchange. They're agreed-upon signals that either party can use to stop or slow down the activity. The safe word in this case was dropping a ball, which the Domme was supposed to notice and stop immediately. The Domme didn't stop even after the ball was dropped, which led to the author experiencing severe pain and injury.\n\nThe Domme's actions went beyond the agreed-upon limits (medium power max). She escalated the intensity (kneeing, booting) and ignored the safe word. This is a violation of the agreed terms. The author's responsibility here is to use the safe word, which they did. The Domme failed to uphold her part of the agreement by ignoring the safe word and causing harm.\n\nThe author didn't pay the remaining balance because the Domme breached their agreement. The Domme then threatened to report the author for non-payment. However, the author has valid reasons: the service wasn't performed as agreed, and there was harm caused. The friend's opinion that the author is an asshole is her own, but the actual responsibility lies with the Domme for not following the safe word protocol.\n\nLegally, in many places, if someone causes injury through negligence, especially in a service where safety protocols are established, the provider could be at fault. The author prioritizing their health by going to the hospital is understandable. The fact that the friend (another domme) is critical might reflect a different perspective within the community, but safety should take precedence over financial obligations when there's a breach of trust and harm involved.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong because the Domme failed to respect the agreed-upon boundaries and safety measures. The author acted in self-preservation and was justified in withholding payment due to the breach of terms and the resulting harm. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
