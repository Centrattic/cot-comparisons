I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The scenario involves a paid session with a Domme (dominant woman) where the writer didn't pay the full amount after the Domme ignored his safe word.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The writer set up a session with clear terms: a $50 deposit, $350 total, and a safe word system using a ball. The Domme didn't ask for payment upfront, which is unusual for her. During the session, the Domme went beyond the agreed \"medium power\" and ignored the safe word when the ball was dropped. The writer ended up in the hospital, had to break restraints, and decided not to pay the remaining $300. The Domme is threatening to involve the community.\n\nThe main issue here is the violation of the safe word. The safe word is crucial in such scenarios to ensure the sub's safety and limits are respected. The Domme's actions, especially continuing after the safe word was triggered, could be considered negligence or intentional harm. The writer's refusal to pay the remaining amount is based on the Domme's failure to adhere to the agreed terms, which directly led to his injury.\n\nNow, considering the friend's opinion that the writer is an asshole for not paying, but the Domme broke the agreed terms. The contract here includes the safe word protocol. If the Domme didn't follow that, she breached the agreement. Therefore, the writer isn't obligated to pay the full amount because the service wasn't delivered as agreed. Additionally, the injury caused might affect any legal obligations, but since it's a private agreement, it's more about mutual terms.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the Domme's actions were the root cause. The writer had the right to terminate the session and seek medical attention. The refusal to pay the remaining amount is a consequence of the Domme's failure to meet the agreed terms. The Domme's threat to involve the community seems like an attempt to pressure payment despite her wrongdoing.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the writer isn't in the wrong. The Domme violated the safe word agreement, caused harm, and the writer's actions were in response to her negligence. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
