I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. So, the situation is about a Domme who didn't respect the safe word during a session, causing the author a lot of pain. The author didn't pay the remaining fee and now the Domme is threatening to tell others in the community. The friend who's also a Domme says the author is an asshole for not paying, but the author felt the Domme was negligent.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what the safe word rules are in BDSM. The safe word is a critical agreement to ensure the sub's limits are respected. If the Domme ignored the safe word, that's a major violation. The author set up a clear safe word: holding a ball, and dropping it to stop. The Domme continued even after the ball was dropped, which means she didn't respect the agreed-upon signals. That's a problem because safety should be the top priority.\n\nThe Domme also went beyond the agreed limits. The author said medium power, but she escalated to full force. That's a breach of the agreement. Plus, the author was in so much pain that they had to break the restraints to stop the session. The Domme then blamed the author for breaking her equipment, which seems unfair since she caused the situation by not following the safe word protocol.\n\nThe author didn't pay the remaining $300 because the Domme didn't adhere to the terms of their agreement. The Domme's response was to threaten the author and demand payment despite her negligence. The friend's argument that the author should have paid regardless is confusing because if the Domme didn't perform as agreed and violated the safe word, the author isn't obligated to pay the full amount. In service agreements, if the provider doesn't fulfill the terms, the client isn't required to pay in full, especially if there was harm caused.\n\nAlso, the author went to the hospital and incurred medical expenses, which adds to the situation. The Domme's actions could be considered reckless, and the author's refusal to pay might be justified as a form of self-defense or non-payment for substandard and harmful service. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong because the Domme failed to uphold the agreed terms, violated the safe word, and caused harm. The author's priority was their health and safety, which is the primary concern in any situation.\n"
