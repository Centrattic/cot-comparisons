I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person in the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a Domme (a dominant partner in a BDSM context) who didn't stop when the safe word was triggered, leading to injury, and the person not paying for the session. The friend, who is also a Domme, says the author is a jerk for not paying and breaking the equipment.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author set up a session with a safe word: holding a ball. If he dropped it, the Domme was supposed to stop. However, she continued after he dropped the ball, leading to severe pain and injury. The author then refused to pay the remaining $300, citing that her actions ignored the safe word and were dangerous. The Domme is threatening to report him in the community.\n\nIn BDSM, consent and communication are crucial. The safe word is a standard practice to ensure boundaries are respected. If the Domme ignored the safe word, that's a serious breach of trust and safety. The author's refusal to pay could be seen as justified because the Domme violated the agreed-upon boundaries, potentially causing harm. However, contracts and deposits might complicate this. The author paid a $50 deposit and agreed to the session, but the main issue is the violation of the safe word leading to injury.\n\nThe friend argues that the Domme pushed the author's limits, which is part of the dynamic, but that's debatable. Pushing limits doesn't mean ignoring a safe word. The injury is a key factor here. The author's health and safety should take precedence over payment. Also, threatening legal action or community backlash from the Domme might be an attempt to pressure the author, but if she breached the agreement, the author has grounds not to pay.\n\nSo, considering the violation of the safe word and the resulting injury, the author isn't in the wrong for refusing to pay. The Domme's actions were unsafe and against their agreement. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
