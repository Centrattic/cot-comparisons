I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that he hired a Domme for a session involving ballbusting. They agreed on a safe word (the ball) that he would drop if he needed her to stop. But she ignored it and kept going, causing him pain and leading to an injury. He didn't pay the remaining $300 and she's threatening to report him to the community.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the agreements made. The safe word system is crucial in such activities because it's meant to ensure safety. If she agreed to stop immediately when he drops the ball, and she didn't, that's a breach of their agreement. She might argue that pushing limits is part of the experience, but the safe word is a hard stop for a reason. The fact that he ended up in the hospital suggests that things got out of hand and she didn't respect his limits. \n\nOn the other hand, he didn't pay the full amount, which she argues she's owed. But if she didn't follow the agreed-upon safety protocols, which are essential for his well-being, maybe he's justified in withholding payment. Also, breaking her equipment might complicate things, but if her actions caused him harm, that's a significant factor. His friend, another Domme, says he's in the wrong, but maybe she's biased or has a different perspective on what's acceptable in play. \n\nThe key points are: the safe word was ignored, leading to injury, and the service provided was unsafe. In such cases, the client might not be obligated to pay the full amount, especially if the safety terms weren't followed. However, the author did agree to certain limits (medium power), and she exceeded that, which is a problem. The fact that he didn't pay could be seen as him not honoring the contract, but the contract was violated by her not respecting the safe word. \n\nSo considering all that, the author might not be in the wrong because the Domme failed to uphold the agreed safety protocol, leading to harm. He's within his rights to refuse payment due to the breach of contract. Therefore, answer B.\n"
