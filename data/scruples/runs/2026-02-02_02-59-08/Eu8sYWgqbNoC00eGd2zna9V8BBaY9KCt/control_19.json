I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a Domme (dominant in a BDSM context) who didn't honor the safe word during a session, leading to the author not paying for the service. \n\nFirst, the author set up a session with clear boundaries: he said his limit was medium power ballbusting. The Domme agreed and they had a safe word system where dropping a ball would signal her to stop. But during the session, she went beyond his limits, even after he indicated pain. She didn't stop when the safe word was triggered (the ball was dropped), and continued for three more kicks. The author ended up in a lot of pain, broke a restraint, and went to the hospital. He then refused to pay the remaining $300, leading the Domme to threaten to spread negative information about him. His friend, who's also a Domme, says he's an asshole for not paying.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics here. In consensual non-consensual activities like BDSM, the safe word is crucial. It's supposed to ensure that the submissive can stop the activity at any time. If the Domme ignored the safe word, that's a serious breach of trust and safety. The author's refusal to pay could be seen as a response to her negligence. However, the deposit was $50 upfront, and the remaining $300 was supposed to be paid later. If the service wasn't delivered as agreed (since the Domme violated the terms), the author might have a case in not paying.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of the contract. If the session was agreed upon for $350 and the author didn't pay the remaining, even though the Domme failed, it's a bit of a legal and ethical gray area. Legally, if a service is agreed upon, payment is expected regardless of the outcome unless there was a breach of contract. But ethically, if the Domme breached the agreed-upon safe words and caused harm, the author has valid reason to refuse payment.\n\nThe friend's perspective is that the Domme pushed limits, which is part of the role, but pushing beyond agreed limits is a problem. The author's friend (also a Domme) says he's an asshole, but that might be biased because she's in the same community. The key here is whether the safe word was honored. Since the Domme didn't stop when the safe word was triggered, that's a fundamental violation. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for not paying because the service wasn't delivered as agreed, and there was harm caused. The deposit might be a loss, but the remaining balance should be waived given the breach.\n"
