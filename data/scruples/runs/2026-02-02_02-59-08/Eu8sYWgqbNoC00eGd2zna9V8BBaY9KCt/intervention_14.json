I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a dominatrix (Domme) and a sub who had a session where the Domme ignored the safe word, leading to injury and the sub refusing to pay.\n\nFirst, the key points are the safe word not being respected. The sub clearly set up a safe word with a specific signal (dropping the ball), which the Domme ignored. The Domme continued despite the sub being in pain beyond the agreed medium level. That's a major red flag because in any consensual power exchange, respecting boundaries and safe words is paramount. The sub's health and safety should take precedence over the session's terms.\n\nThe sub didn't pay because the Domme didn't follow the agreed safety protocols, which led to injury. The Domme then threatened to report the sub for non-payment and equipment damage. The sub friend (also a Domme) argues that the sub should have paid, implying that the Domme pushing limits is part of the role. However, pushing limits shouldn't come at the expense of the sub's safety. The fact that the sub ended up injured and had to go to the hospital is a serious issue. \n\nLegally, if the Domme didn't adhere to the agreed terms (safe word), there might be an argument that the service wasn't performed as contracted, so the sub isn't obligated to pay. Ethically, the Domme's actions were negligent. The sub's refusal to pay is a response to the Domme's failure to ensure safety. The Domme's retaliation for non-payment is problematic because she didn't fulfill her end of the agreement.\n\nThe sub's friend might be conflating the dynamics of a consensual power exchange with a business transaction. Even in such arrangements, the health and safety of the sub are the top priority. The sub's decision to seek medical attention shows that their well-being was at risk, which invalidates the argument that they should have paid regardless.\n\nSo, considering the failure to respect the safe word leading to injury, the sub's refusal to pay is justified. The Domme's actions were in violation of the agreed terms and caused harm. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
