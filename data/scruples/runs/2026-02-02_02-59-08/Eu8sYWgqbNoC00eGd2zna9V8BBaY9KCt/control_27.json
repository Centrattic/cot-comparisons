I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is at fault for not paying the domme after she ignored his safe word.\n\nFirst, the key points from the scenario: The author set up a session with a domme, agreed on a safe word (dropping a ball), which was supposed to stop the session immediately. The domme proceeded beyond the agreed limits, causing severe pain, and even after the safe word was triggered (the ball being dropped), she continued for three more kicks. The author then broke free, was yelled at, and refused to pay the remaining $300. The domme threatened to report him to the community for non-payment.\n\nThe author's friend, who's also a domme, says the author is in the wrong because the domme pushed limits and he didn't pay and damaged equipment. But the main issue here is the violation of the safe word, which is a critical part of any consensual power exchange. The safe word is meant to stop the activity immediately for safety. The domme's disregard for it led to harm, which the author had to seek medical attention for. \n\nIn consensual activities, especially those involving risk, the bottom's boundaries and safe words must be respected. If the domme didn't follow through, she breached the agreed terms. The author's refusal to pay could be seen as justified because the service didn't adhere to the agreed-upon safety measures, leading to harm. Additionally, the damage to the equipment was due to the domme's actions, not the author's. The domme's threat to report him for non-payment seems unfair given the circumstances. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong because the domme violated the agreed-upon safe word and caused harm. The author's priority was his safety and health, which is the main concern in any consensual activity.\n"
