I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a paid domme session where the author didn't pay after the domme ignored their safe word, leading to injury.\n\nFirst, the safe word is crucial in such scenarios. The author set up a safe word system where dropping a ball would signal the domme to stop. However, the domme didn't stop when the safe word was triggered, leading to the author being injured. The author then refused to pay the remaining $300 because the domme violated their agreed-upon safety measures.\n\nThe domme's actions here seem to be the main issue. Ignoring a safe word is a serious breach of trust and safety. The author's refusal to pay is a direct consequence of this violation. The friend's opinion that the author should have paid regardless seems misguided because the domme failed to adhere to the agreed terms, which were essential for the author's safety.\n\nThe author did pay a $50 deposit, but the total was $350. After the incident, they wouldn't have to pay the remaining $300 since the domme didn't fulfill her part of the agreement. The author's decision not to pay is justified because the service was not provided as agreed, especially with safety being compromised.\n\nAdditionally, the domme's response of threatening to report the author for non-payment and losing money over broken equipment is more indicative of her own negligence. If she had followed the safe word protocol, the equipment wouldn't have been broken, and the author wouldn't have been harmed.\n\nIn terms of legal and ethical considerations, the safe word is a binding agreement in such consensual activities. The domme's failure to honor it is a breach of contract and a violation of safety standards. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong for not paying after the domme's misconduct.\n"
