I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a paid session with a domme where the safe word wasn't respected, leading to injury and the decision not to pay.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author set up a session with agreed terms, including a safe word. During the session, the domme ignored the safe word, causing the author physical harm. The author then refused to pay the remaining amount and faced backlash from the domme and a friend who's also a domme.\n\nThe main issue here is whether the author is at fault for not paying. The author's side is that the domme breached the agreed-upon safety measures, leading to injury. The domme's side is that the author didn't pay for the service and damaged equipment.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, contracts typically require payment for services rendered, but if there was a breach of contract (ignoring safety protocols), that could affect the obligation to pay. However, without a formal contract, it's more about mutual agreement. The domme might argue she provided the service, but the author could argue it was incomplete or unsafe.\n\nEthically, the domme's actions were negligent. The safe word system is crucial in such activities to prevent harm. By ignoring the safe word, the domme failed to meet her responsibility as a domme. The author's refusal to pay could be justified as the service was harmful and violated the agreed terms. The friend's opinion that the author is at fault might be based on the idea that the domme was adhering to the agreed intensity, but the author's injury suggests that the domme exceeded agreed limits.\n\nAdditionally, the domme's reaction to the broken equipment seems misplaced, especially when the author was injured. The author's priority was health, which is understandable. The threat to report the author for non-payment might not hold if the service was unsafe.\n\nIn conclusion, the domme's actions were the primary issue here. The author is not in the wrong for withholding payment after being harmed and having the safe word ignored. The friend's judgment doesn't account for the domme's breach of the agreement. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
