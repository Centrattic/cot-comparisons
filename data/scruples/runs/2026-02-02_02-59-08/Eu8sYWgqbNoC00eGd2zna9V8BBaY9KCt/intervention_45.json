I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a dominatrix (Domme) who didn't stop when the submissive (the writer) used the safe word, leading to injury and the writer refusing to pay.\n\nFirst, the key elements here are consent, safety protocols, and payment terms. The writer set up a session with specific limits and a safe word system. The Domme ignored the safe word after the ball was dropped, which was supposed to signal stopping. This led to the writer being injured and then refusing to pay the remaining amount. The Domme is now threatening to spread negative information about the writer.\n\nFrom the writer's perspective, they followed the agreed-upon safe word system, which the Domme failed to respect. The Domme exceeded the agreed-upon intensity, causing harm. The writer, in self-defense, broke the restraints and left without paying, citing the Domme's negligence.\n\nThe friend who's also a Domme argues that the writer should have paid, claiming the Domme just pushed limits as part of the role. But the main issue here is the violation of the safe word, which is a critical safety measure in such activities. If the Domme didn't stop upon the safe word being triggered, she breached the essential trust and safety agreement. The writer's decision not to pay could be seen as justified because the Domme didn't adhere to the agreed terms, leading to harm. \n\nHowever, the payment terms were set before the session, and the writer might have agreed to pay regardless of the outcome. But if the service wasn't delivered as per the agreed terms (i.e., respecting the safe word and not causing harm), then the writer might not be obligated to pay the full amount. The injury also adds a layer where the writer could argue the session was negligently conducted. \n\nOn the other hand, if payment was part of the contract regardless of the session's outcome, the writer might be in the wrong for not fulfilling the payment. But given that the Domme failed to follow the safety protocols, leading to harm, the writer's refusal to pay could be justified as the service wasn't performed as agreed. \n\nThe friend's opinion that the writer is an \"asshole\" might be biased due to the friend's own role as a Domme. The real issue is whether the Domme's actions constituted a breach of the agreed terms. If the safe word system was established and the Domme ignored it, the writer is not in the wrong for refusing payment. The writer's health and safety are paramount, and the Domme's failure to adhere to the safe word protocol is a critical failure in the role. \n\nTherefore, the writer is not in the wrong because the Domme violated the agreed-upon safety measures, leading to injury and breach of trust. The writer has the right to refuse payment when the agreed terms were not met.\n"
