I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a Domme (dominant) and a sub (the author). They set up a session where the Domme is supposed to do ballbusting, and they agreed on a safe word system. The safe word was dropping a ball, which the author did after the Domme went beyond the agreed intensity. The Domme didn't stop, continued, and then the author ended up injured, had to go to the hospital, and refused to pay the remaining $300. The Domme is threatening to report him to the community.\n\nFirst, the key points are:\n\n1. They had a prior agreement on limits and a safe word.\n2. The Domme ignored the safe word, leading to injury.\n3. The author didn't pay the full amount, arguing that the Domme violated the agreement and caused harm.\n4. The friend (another Domme) says the author is wrong for not paying.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics of consensual non-consensual play. Typically, in such scenarios, there's an emphasis on safety words and mutual consent. The safe word is supposed to be a hard stop. If the Domme ignored the safe word, she violated the agreement. The author's injury is a result of her not respecting the safe word.\n\nBut, the author didn't pay the full amount. The contract was for a 90-minute session for $350. He paid a $50 deposit. The Domme didn't ask for the money upfront, which is unusual. The author left before the session ended and didn't pay the remaining $300. The question is whether he's obligated to pay even though the Domme violated the agreement.\n\nIn terms of legal perspective, if there was a contract (verbal or implied), and the service wasn't completed as agreed, the author might not be obligated to pay. However, in practice, in community settings like this, there might be expectations of payment regardless. The friend's opinion is that the author is an asshole for not paying, but legally, if the service was not delivered properly, the client might not have to pay.\n\nEthically, the Domme failed to provide the agreed service and caused harm. The author's refusal to pay could be justified as self-defense in the context of the breach of agreement. However, from the Domme's perspective, she provided the session (though improperly), and expects payment. The author's injury complicates things, as he might have a case for not paying if the service was not rendered as agreed.\n\nBut in many services, if a provider fails to deliver the service properly, the client isn't obligated to pay. However, in some contexts, especially if there's a verbal agreement, the client might still need to pay unless there's a breach. Here, the Domme breached the agreement by ignoring the safe word, which directly caused harm. Therefore, the author might not be in the wrong for not paying.\n\nBut the author's actions of not paying and the Domme's threats to report him create a conflict. The author could be seen as right in not paying because the service wasn't properly delivered, but the friend (another Domme) thinks otherwise, implying that the author should pay regardless. However, the author's injury is a significant factor. If the Domme's actions were negligent, leading to injury, the author might have grounds to not pay and possibly seek compensation, but that's different from this case.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for not paying. If the Domme violated the safe word agreement, leading to injury, then the author isn't at fault for withholding payment. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
