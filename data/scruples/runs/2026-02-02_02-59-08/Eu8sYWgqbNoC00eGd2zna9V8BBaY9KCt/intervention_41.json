I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a paid session with a domme where the author didn't pay the remaining fee after the domme allegedly ignored his safe word during ballbusting.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author paid a deposit, set a safe word (dropping a ball), but when he dropped it, she didn't stop. She continued, causing him severe pain and injury. He then left without paying the rest, and she's threatening to report him. His friend, another domme, says he's an asshole for not paying, while he argues she was negligent.\n\nLegally, contracts are involved here. The deposit is part of the contract, but he didn't pay the full amount. However, if the domme breached the agreed terms (ignoring the safe word, causing harm), that might void the contract. But in the BDSM community, there's a strong emphasis on consent and safewords. If the domme violated the safeword, that's a serious issue, potentially making her liable for any harm caused.\n\nEthically, the author's decision not to pay could be justified if the domme didn't follow the agreed safety protocols. However, he did sustain injuries, which complicates the situation. His friend's argument is that even if the domme pushed limits, the contract still requires payment. But if the domme was negligent, that might relieve the author from his contractual obligation.\n\nAlso, the author's friend, being a domme, might prioritize reputation and professional standards over the client's rights in this scenario. However, the key is whether the domme adhered to the agreed terms. If she didn't, he might have a valid reason not to pay. On the other hand, leaving without paying could be seen as abandoning the contract, which is a breach.\n\nAnother angle: the author's friend says she pushed limits like a good domme. But the safe word was ignored, which is a red flag. The domme's actions might have crossed into assault if she knowingly caused harm. In that case, the author has a right to refuse payment and seek medical attention.\n\nSo, considering both legal and ethical aspects, the author might not be in the wrong because the domme failed to uphold her end of the agreement by ignoring the safe word and causing injury. Therefore, he's justified in not paying the remaining fee. The answer would be B.\n"
