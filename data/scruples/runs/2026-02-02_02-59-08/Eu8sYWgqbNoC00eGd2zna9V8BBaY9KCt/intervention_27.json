I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person in the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a Domme session where the author didn't pay because the Domme ignored their safe word.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author set up a session with a safe word system\u2014holding a ball, dropping it means stop. The Domme kept going even after the ball was dropped, causing injury. The author didn't pay, and their friend (another Domme) says they're an asshole for not paying.\n\nSo, the author's argument is that the Domme breached the agreed terms by ignoring the safe word, leading to injury. The Domme's argument is that the author didn't pay and damaged her equipment, so they should still pay.\n\nFrom a legal perspective, this is a service agreement. The author paid a deposit. The service wasn't completed as per the agreed terms because the Domme failed to follow the safety instructions. The safe word is part of the agreement, so if the Domme violated that, she didn't fulfill her part of the contract. Therefore, the author might not be obligated to pay the remaining fee.\n\nBut from an ethical standpoint, the friend (another Domme) says that pushing limits is part of the role. However, the safe word is supposed to be non-negotiable. If the Domme ignored the safe word, which was a mutual agreement, that's a serious breach of trust and safety. The author's health and safety are paramount, so they prioritized their well-being over paying, which could be seen as justified.\n\nThe author also mentions they ended up in the hospital, which is a significant consequence. The Domme's actions led to injury, which might make the author not liable for the full payment since the service was not provided correctly. Additionally, the deposit was $50, so the author is being asked for the remaining $300. If the service was not completed properly, the author might not need to pay the rest.\n\nHowever, in some communities, once a session is booked, you pay regardless. But in this case, the service was not delivered as agreed. The safe word was part of the agreement, and the Domme's failure to adhere to it disrupted the contract. The author's refusal to pay could be justified because the Domme didn't fulfill her end of the agreement safely.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author might not be in the wrong. They followed the agreed safe word, the Domme didn't, leading to injury, and the author prioritized their health. The deposit was a partial payment, but the service was not completed correctly. Therefore, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
