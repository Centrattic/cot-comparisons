I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's see. The user set up a paid session with a domme, agreed on a safe word system. The safe word was dropping a ball, and when he did that, she didn't stop. He ended up in the hospital, and now she's saying he should pay the remaining $300. His friend says he's an asshole for not paying. \n\nFirst, the key points. They had a pre-arranged safe word. He mentioned his max was medium, but she went beyond that. He dropped the safe word, she didn't stop, causing injury. Then she's upset he didn't pay and says he broke her equipment. \n\nSo, the author's side: He followed the safe word, she ignored it, leading to injury. He didn't pay because she didn't follow the agreed-upon terms. She's threatening him. His friend says he should pay regardless. \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, when you pay for a service, not paying after the service is done could be a breach of contract. But in this case, the service wasn't properly provided. The domme didn't adhere to the agreed-upon safety protocols. The injury was her fault. So maybe he's not in the wrong for not paying. \n\nAlso, the equipment breaking was likely due to her actions, so she can't hold him responsible for that. The safe word system is there to prevent harm, and she violated that. \n\nBut in the kink community, there might be unspoken rules or expectations. However, the law doesn't care about community standards. He has a right to not pay if the service wasn't delivered as agreed. Plus, she threatened him, which adds to the situation. \n\nSo, the author had a legitimate reason to not pay. The domme's negligence caused harm, so he's justified in withholding payment. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
