I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a Domme and a sub who agreed on a session with a safe word using a ball. The Domme didn't stop when the safe word was triggered and the sub ended up hurt, not paying the remaining $300. The sub's friend, who's also a domme, is telling them they're an asshole for not paying.\n\nFirst, the key points here are the agreed-upon safe word and the Domme's responsibility. The sub had clearly set a safe word and said their maximum pain level was medium. The Domme, however, went beyond that, even after the sub dropped the ball (the safe word signal). The Domme didn't stop immediately, which is a major breach of trust and safety. The sub ended up needing medical attention, which is a serious outcome.\n\nIn terms of legal and ethical considerations, the Domme didn't follow the agreed safety measures. The sub wasn't at fault for not paying because the service was not delivered as agreed. The Domme's actions were negligent, and the sub was within their rights to prioritize their health and safety. The friend's opinion that the sub should pay despite the Domme's failure is misguided because the contract (session) was not fulfilled properly. The sub is not obligated to pay for a service that resulted in harm due to the provider's negligence.\n\nAdditionally, the sub didn't ask for the money upfront, but that's not the main issue here. The main issue is the violation of the safe word protocol. The Domme's threat to ruin the sub's reputation is also problematic, as revenge in such situations is unethical. \n\nSo, considering the Domme's failure to honor the safe word and the resulting harm, the sub is in the right for not paying. The answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
