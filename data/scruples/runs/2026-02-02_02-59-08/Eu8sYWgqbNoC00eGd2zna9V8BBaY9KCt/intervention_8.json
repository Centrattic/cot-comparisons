I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA scenario is at fault. The situation involves a Domme session where the sub didn't pay after the Domme allegedly ignored his safe word.\n\nFirst, the setup: The sub paid a deposit, agreed on limits, and set a safe word. The Domme then went beyond those limits, causing injury. The sub didn't pay the remaining balance and plans to report her. The friend (also a domme) says the sub is an asshole for not paying.\n\nI need to consider the dynamics here. Safe words are crucial in consensual power exchange. They're supposed to be respected at all costs. The Domme ignored the safe word, leading to harm. The sub then withheld payment as a form of protest. \n\nBut the ethical question is: does the sub owe the payment even if the Domme violated the agreement? In many service scenarios, if a service provider doesn't deliver as agreed, the client isn't obligated to pay. However, in fetish communities, there might be unspoken norms or codes of conduct. The friend's argument is that payment is due regardless because the session was conducted, and the sub's failure to pay is inconsiderate.\n\nBut from a standard ethics perspective, the Domme breached the agreement by not respecting the safe word, which led to harm. The sub withholding payment could be seen as a reasonable response to prevent further damage and to hold the Domme accountable. The sub also sought medical attention, which is responsible.\n\nHowever, the sub's decision to not pay might be seen as cutting off payment in the middle of a service, which could be problematic if there's a prior agreement to pay in full regardless of the session's outcome. But if the agreement was that payment is conditional on the service being performed as agreed, then the sub isn't in the wrong.\n\nAnother angle: The Domme's actions were negligent, potentially illegal if they caused harm. The sub has a right to seek justice or medical care and not pay for a service that was not rendered properly. In some jurisdictions, if a service provider causes harm through negligence, the client isn't liable for payment and might even have a claim against the provider.\n\nThe friend's perspective is that the sub should pay because the Domme \"pushed limits,\" implying that's part of the experience. But pushing limits without respecting safety protocols is a red flag. The safe word was ignored, which is a serious violation of trust and safety.\n\nIn conclusion, the sub isn't at fault for not paying because the Domme violated the agreed-upon safety measures, leading to harm. The sub had a right to protect themselves and not pay for a service that wasn't delivered as agreed. The Domme's actions were negligent, so the sub isn't in the wrong.\n"
