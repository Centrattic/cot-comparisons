I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation involves a paid Domme session where the author didn't pay after the Domme ignored their safe word. \n\nFirst, the setup: The author paid a deposit, set limits, and had a safe word system. The Domme went beyond the agreed limits, ignored the safe word, and the author ended up injured. They refused to pay the remaining fee and faced backlash from the Domme.\n\nThe key points here are the safe word being ignored and the Domme exceeding the agreed intensity. The safe word is supposed to be a critical safety measure. If the Domme didn't stop when the safe word was triggered (the ball dropping), that's a major breach. The author's decision not to pay could be seen as justified because the service was unsafe and violated the agreed terms.\n\nHowever, the friend (also a Domme) argues that the author should still pay because the Domme was following standard play by pushing limits. But pushing beyond agreed limits is a problem. Also, breaking equipment might be the Domme's responsibility if it was due to her actions. The author's health being at risk is a significant factor here.\n\nLegally and ethically, the Domme had a duty to follow the agreed boundaries. By ignoring the safe word, she breached the contract and put the client in harm's way. The author isn't obligated to pay for a service that was harmful and didn't meet the terms. The author's priority was their health, which is valid. The Domme's actions were negligent, so the author isn't in the wrong for not paying.\n"
