I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for not paying the Domme after she ignored their safe word. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe user set up a session with a Domme, paid a deposit, and agreed on a safe word system. The safe word was dropping a ball, which the user did when they were in pain. However, the Domme continued the session despite the safe word being used. The user then left, didn't pay the remaining amount, and the Domme is threatening to report them. The friend, who's also a Domme, says the user is in the wrong for not paying and for breaking the equipment.\n\nSo, the key points here are the agreed-upon safe word and the Domme's actions. The user used the safe word, which should have stopped the session immediately. The Domme didn't stop, leading to injury. The user didn't pay the remaining fee. In the kink community, there's a lot about consent and safety, so using a safe word is a critical part of that. If the Domme ignored the safe word, that's a serious breach of agreed terms. \n\nIn terms of the payment, if the service wasn't provided as agreed, the user might not be obligated to pay. However, there's a deposit. The user paid $50 upfront, and the total was $350. They didn't pay the remaining $300. The friend says the user should have paid regardless because the Domme pushed their limits but that's part of the play. But pushing beyond agreed limits is a violation of consent. The Domme's actions could be considered misconduct, making the user not at fault for stopping the session and not paying because the service wasn't delivered as agreed. Also, the user was injured, which is a major point against the Domme.\n\nIn the kink community, consent and adherence to safe words are paramount. Ignoring a safe word is a serious issue, potentially unsafe and non-consensual. The user's decision to leave and not pay might be justified because the Domme didn't follow the agreed safety protocols. The user's friend being a Domme might have a different perspective, but the community standards should prioritize the bottom's safety. \n\nSo, considering all that, the user isn't in the wrong for not paying because the Domme violated the safe word agreement, which is a fundamental part of consensual kink play. The user had the right to leave and seek medical help. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
