I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not paying a dominatrix after she ignored their safe word. So, the situation is a paid Domme session where the user specified their limits for ballbusting as light to medium. The Domme, however, went beyond that, leading to severe pain and the user dropping the safe word ball. Despite this, she kept going for three more powerful kicks. The user then claims they didn't pay the remaining $300 because of this.\n\nFirst, the key points here are about consent and safety in a consensual power exchange. The user had communicated their limits clearly, and the safe word system was established. The Domme's actions led to the user being in a lot of pain and feeling like they couldn't breathe. The safe word was supposed to be a signal to stop immediately, but she didn't honor it. That's a serious issue because in any consensual kink activity, respecting the safe word is paramount. \n\nThe Domme might argue that she was pushing the user's limits, but pushing doesn't mean ignoring the agreed-upon safe word. There's a difference between testing limits and disregarding safety protocols. If the user had a medical emergency, it would be even worse. The user ended up in the hospital, which shows that the situation was dangerous. Even though the friend (another Domme) says the user is an asshole for not paying, that might be because she's part of the same community and values different. However, the user's primary obligation is to their own safety and health. \n\nIn terms of payment, if the session was conducted in a way that endangered the user's well-being, they might not be obligated to pay. The Domme's actions could be considered a breach of the agreed terms, making the user justified in withholding payment. Also, the user's friend's opinion that they should pay even after breaking the equipment seems to support the idea that the user was at fault, but that might be because she's a Domme and has a different perspective. The user's main responsibility is to protect themselves from harm, which they did by going to the hospital. The Domme's reaction of threatening to expose them and demanding payment despite their injury seems more about protecting her own interests rather than the user's safety. \n\nSo, putting it all together: The user communicated their limits and the safe word, the Domme didn't respect them, caused harm, and then the user decided not to pay. The user's action of not paying might be justified because the Domme failed to adhere to the safety agreement. The user is in the right because consent and safety are non-negotiable, even in consensual relationships. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
