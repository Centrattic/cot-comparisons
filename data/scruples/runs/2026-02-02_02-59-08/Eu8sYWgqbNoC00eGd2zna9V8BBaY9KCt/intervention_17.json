I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for not paying a Domme after she ignored his safe word during a session.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The Domme and the sub had agreed on a safe word system. The safe word was dropping a ball, which would signal her to stop. But when the sub dropped the ball, she continued the activity, causing him significant pain. He ended up in the hospital but was okay. He didn't pay the remaining $300 and the Domme threatened to expose him. His friend, another Domme, said he was in the wrong for not paying and breaking the equipment.\n\nNow, the key points here are consent and safety. The safe word is a critical part of any consensual power exchange. The Domme's job is to respect the sub's boundaries and limits. By ignoring the safe word, she violated the agreed-upon terms, which is a serious issue. The sub's safety was compromised, leading to injury and hospitalization. \n\nThe Domme's actions went beyond the agreed-upon limits, which is a breach of trust and safety. In such scenarios, the sub has the right to refuse payment if the professional standards were not met. The fact that the sub ended up in the hospital supports his decision not to pay. \n\nHowever, the friend's argument is that the Domme was just pushing his limits, which is a part of the play. But pushing limits shouldn't come at the expense of violating the safe word. The safe word is meant to protect the sub, and ignoring it is a red flag. \n\nThe sub also mentions breaking the restraints, which the Domme blames on him. But if she was following proper protocols, she should have been monitoring his condition and stopping when the safe word was triggered. The damage to the equipment might be a result of her failure to respond appropriately. \n\nIn terms of payment, the sub paid a deposit. The remaining balance is expected for the service, but the service was not delivered correctly. The Domme failed to adhere to the agreed-upon safety measures, so the sub's decision not to pay could be justified. \n\nThe Domme threatening to expose him seems like an attempt to intimidate him into paying despite her own violations. The sub's priority was his health, which is valid. \n\nIn conclusion, the Domme's actions were negligent and unsafe, violating the safe word agreement. The sub's refusal to pay the remaining amount is a response to her breach of trust and safety. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
