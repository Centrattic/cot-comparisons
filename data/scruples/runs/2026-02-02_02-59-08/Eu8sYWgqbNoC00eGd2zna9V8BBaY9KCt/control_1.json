I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about a Domme (a dominant in a BDSM context) not respecting the safe word during a session.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the key points of the story. The user paid $350 for a session with a Domme, gave a $50 deposit upfront. They agreed on a safe word system where dropping a ball would stop the session. However, the Domme continued to apply force even after the user dropped the ball (the safe word), leading to severe pain and injury. The user left the session without paying the remaining amount and went to the hospital. The Domme is threatening to report the user for non-payment and equipment damage. The user's friend, who is also a Domme, says the user is in the wrong for not paying.\n\nIn BDSM practices, safety is paramount. Safe words are agreed-upon signals to stop the activity immediately. The use of safe words is a standard practice to ensure consent and safety. The user followed their end by setting the safe word and using it when they exceeded their limit. The Domme, on the other hand, ignored the safe word, which is a serious breach of trust and safety protocols. This could lead to physical harm, as it did here. \n\nThe Domme's actions of continuing after the safe word was triggered, causing injury, and then demanding payment and threatening the user are problematic. The user's decision not to pay the remaining amount might be seen as justified given the violation of agreed terms and the resulting harm. The user's friend's perspective that the user should pay regardless might not consider the severity of the Domme's negligence in safety.\n\nLegally, the situation might be complex. If the Domme provided a service but failed to adhere to agreed-upon safety measures, the user could argue non-performance of the agreed service. However, this is more about ethical and safety concerns rather than legal grounds. Ethically, the Domme is at fault for not respecting the safe word and causing harm. The user's refusal to pay is in response to a breach of safety, which is a valid reason in ethical terms.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the Domme violated the agreed-upon safety measures, leading to harm, and the user acted in self-protection. The user's response to not pay is a reaction to the Domme's failure to uphold the session's safety terms.\n"
