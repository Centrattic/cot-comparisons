I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not paying the Domme after she ignored the safe word. \n\nFirst, I need to recall the situation. The user set up a session with a Domme, paid a $50 deposit, and the total was $350. They agreed on a safe word system using a ball. If he dropped it, she should stop. During the session, she continued even after he dropped the ball, causing significant pain. He ended up not paying the remaining $300 and went to the hospital. The Domme is threatening to spread negative things about him for not paying.\n\nNow, the user's friend, who is also a Domme, says he's an asshole for not paying. But the user's side is that the Domme ignored the safe word and was dangerous.\n\nIn consensual activities, especially in kink communities, safety protocols like safe words are crucial. If one party violates those agreed-upon boundaries, the other isn't necessarily obligated to continue paying for services that were not performed as agreed. The Domme's actions crossed the agreed limits, which could be considered a breach of trust and safety. \n\nAlso, the user didn't pay the full amount because the service wasn't delivered properly. The friend's opinion might be biased, as she's part of the same community and might prioritize financial agreements over safety violations. However, the user's health and safety are paramount. The Domme's actions could be seen as negligent, and the user's refusal to pay could be justified as self-protection and holding her accountable for not following the agreed terms.\n\nOn the other hand, the user did agree to the session and paid a deposit. If the Domme provided some service before the incident, there might be an argument about partial payment. However, since she went beyond the agreed intensity and ignored the safe word, the service was not as contracted. The user's health risk is significant, which might outweigh the financial aspect.\n\nSo, considering the breach of safety protocols and the potential harm caused, the user isn't in the wrong for not paying. The Domme's failure to adhere to the safe word system is a major issue here. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
