I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is at fault for not paying a domme after she ignored their safe word. The situation involves a consensual power exchange scenario, but things went wrong.\n\nFirst, the setup: The author paid a deposit, set a safe word (dropping a ball), and agreed on limits. The domme then went beyond the agreed intensity, ignoring the safe word when the ball was dropped. This led to the author experiencing severe pain, breaking restraints, and needing medical attention. The domme then demanded the remaining payment and threatened the author.\n\nFrom a consent and safety perspective, the safe word is crucial. If a safe word is established and not respected, the activity is no longer consensual. The domme's actions here violated the agreed boundaries, which could be seen as assault. The author's decision not to pay is justified because the domme breached the agreed terms, causing harm. Additionally, the domme's threat to harm the author's reputation in the community seems like an attempt to exert power post-incident, which is unfair.\n\nThe friend's argument that the author should pay because the domme pushed limits doesn't hold because pushing beyond agreed limits is a violation. The broken restraints were a result of the domme's actions, not the author's fault. Medical expenses and physical harm should take precedence over payment for a service that was not performed as agreed and caused injury.\n\nIn many jurisdictions, if someone causes injury through negligence or breach of agreed safety, the injured party isn't obligated to pay and may have legal recourse. The author's refusal to pay and seeking medical help is a reasonable response to a dangerous situation. The domme's threats are coercive and shouldn't compel payment when there's a clear breach of terms and harm caused.\n\nSo, the author is not in the wrong. The key points are the violation of the safe word, exceeding agreed limits, causing harm, and the domme's subsequent demands and threats. The answer should be B.\n"
