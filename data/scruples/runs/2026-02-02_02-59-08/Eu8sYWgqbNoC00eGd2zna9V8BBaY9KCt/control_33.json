I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a Domme (a dominant in a BDSM context) who didn't stop when the author used the safe word during a session. The author ended up not paying the Domme because she ignored the safe word, leading to injury. The friend, who is also a Domme, says the author is an asshole for not paying.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the basics of consent and safety in BDSM practices. The key concepts here are safe words and the responsibility of both parties to honor them. Typically, in consensual BDSM activities, the dominant is supposed to respect the sub's boundaries and safe words. If a safe word is triggered, the activity should stop immediately.\n\nIn the story, the safe word was dropping a ball. The author drops it multiple times, but the Domme continues the activity, causing him harm. This seems like a clear violation of their agreed-upon safety measures. The Domme's actions led to the author being injured, which is a big deal. \n\nNow, the author didn't pay the remaining $300 because he felt the Domme was negligent. The Domme then threatens to report him to the community and accuses him of breaking her equipment. The author's friend says he's wrong not to pay, arguing that the Domme pushed limits normally and that the author is responsible for breaking the restraints.\n\nSo, who's at fault here? The Domme's main responsibility is to ensure the sub's safety. By ignoring the safe word and continuing the activity beyond the agreed limits, she breached the trust and safety protocols. The author, while in pain, tried to use the safe word, which wasn't honored. His non-payment is a response to her negligence. However, the friend's perspective is that the Domme is still owed payment because she provided the service, even if it was harmful.\n\nBut in consensual activities, especially those involving trust and safety, the provider has a duty of care. If the Domme didn't adhere to the safe word, she's not fulfilling her role properly. The author acting in self-preservation by leaving and not paying could be justified because the Domme failed to meet the agreed terms. Also, the broken restraints might be due to her excessive force, not the author's fault. So, the author might not be in the wrong. \n\nHowever, there's the aspect of payment for services rendered. But since the service was not performed as per the agreed terms (safe word ignored, causing harm), the author isn't necessarily obligated to pay. Plus, the Domme's threat to report him for non-payment could be seen as aggressive and possibly retaliatory. \n\nIn conclusion, the Domme's actions were the primary issue. The author's refusal to pay is a response to her violation of their agreement, so he's not in the wrong.\n"
