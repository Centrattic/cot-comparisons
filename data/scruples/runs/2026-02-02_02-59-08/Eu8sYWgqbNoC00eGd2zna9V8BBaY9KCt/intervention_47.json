I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that he hired a Domme for a session involving ballbusting, which he specified as light to medium. They had a safe word system where if he dropped the ball, she should stop. But when she went beyond his limits and ignored the safe word, causing him injury, he didn't pay her. Now he's being criticized by his friend who's also a domme, saying he's a douche and should have paid her anyway.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the agreed-upon terms. The safe word is crucial in such activities; it's meant to ensure the sub's safety. If the Domme ignored the safe word and went beyond the agreed limits, that's a serious breach of trust and safety. The author's health was compromised, leading to the need for a hospital visit. In that case, the Domme's actions were negligent, possibly even abusive. \n\nNow, regarding payment. Typically, when someone provides a service and the service is interrupted due to their own fault, the client isn't obligated to pay the full amount. Since the Domme didn't adhere to the agreed-upon limits and ignored the safe word, the session wasn't completed as per the original agreement. The author's refusal to pay could be justified because the service was not delivered properly, and he was harmed. The Domme's threat to spread negative information about him for not paying might be her issue, but if she breached the contract by not following safety protocols, the author might have a valid reason to withhold payment. \n\nHowever, there's the aspect of the broken restraints. The author broke the restraints while thrashing, which might be considered his responsibility. But the root cause was the Domme's actions. If the restraints broke because he was in pain due to her exceeding his limits, then it's still her fault. \n\nIn many service agreements, if the provider doesn't meet the agreed terms, the client isn't required to pay. The author's main issue was the safety violation. The Domme's role is to ensure the client's safety and follow the agreed limits. By ignoring the safe word, she failed in her duty. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for not paying because the service was not provided as contracted, and his safety was compromised. The friend's opinion that he should pay regardless is short-sighted because it ignores the Domme's negligence. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. The Domme's actions were the problem, and he's justified in not paying her for a session that was not conducted properly and caused harm.\n"
