I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a Domme (dominant) and a sub (the author) in a role-play scenario where the author didn't pay after the Domme ignored his safe word.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The author set up a session with a Domme, agreed on a safe word system where dropping a ball would signal her to stop. During the session, the Domme continued even after the safe word was triggered, leading to injury. The author then refused to pay the remaining balance, leading to the Domme threatening to report him to the community.\n\nThe friend's opinion is that the author is an asshole because the Domme pushed his limits, which is part of the role-play, and he didn't pay, causing her financial loss. But the author's side is that the Domme disregarded the safety agreement, leading to harm, so he didn't pay.\n\nNow, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The safe word system is crucial in consensual power exchange. Both parties agree on boundaries and signals. The Domme's responsibility is to respect the sub's limits and stop immediately upon a safe word. By ignoring the safe word, the Domme violated the agreed-upon terms, which is a serious breach of trust and safety. The author was harmed, which could be a legal issue, especially if there was negligence.\n\nFrom a payment standpoint, the Domme provided the service but didn't adhere to the agreed terms. The author's refusal to pay could be seen as justified because the service was not delivered as agreed. However, the friend argues that the Domme's actions were within the role-play, so the author should still pay. But if the Domme ignored the safe word, it's not just role-play anymore; it's a violation of consent and safety protocols.\n\nLegally, if the Domme's actions caused harm, the author might have grounds to not pay and potentially seek compensation for medical expenses. Ethically, the Domme is at fault for not respecting the boundaries. The author's refusal to pay could be seen as a response to the Domme's violation of the agreement. However, in some consensual non-consent role-plays, there might be different expectations, but the safe word is a critical red line. \n\nIn conclusion, the Domme's actions were in violation of the agreed-upon terms, leading to harm. The author's refusal to pay stems from not receiving the agreed service due to the Domme's negligence. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
