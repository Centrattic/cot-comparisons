I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not paying the Domme after she ignored his safe word during a session. The author set up a session where they agreed on a safe word (dropping a ball) and limits (medium power max). The Domme ended up going beyond that, causing pain, ignored the safe word, and then the author didn't pay the remaining $300.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of a Dom/sub relationship, especially in consensual power exchange. The safe word system is crucial for safety, and if the Domme ignored it, that's a serious breach of trust and safety. The author's primary responsibility is to their own safety. If the Domme violated the agreed terms, the author isn't at fault for not paying. Additionally, the Domme continued past the safe word, which could be considered negligence or even assault in some contexts. Breaking equipment might be a separate issue, but if the Domme was at fault, the author isn't responsible for that. The friend's opinion that the author is a douche might be from a different perspective, but the main issue here is the Domme's actions. So, the author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing their health and withholding payment when the Domme didn't adhere to the agreed safety measures.\n"
