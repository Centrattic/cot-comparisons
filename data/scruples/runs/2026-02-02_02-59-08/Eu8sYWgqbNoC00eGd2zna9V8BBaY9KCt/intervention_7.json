I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong after not paying a Domme following a session where the Domme ignored the safe word. \n\nFirst, the setup: The author paid a deposit, set up a safeword (dropping a ball), and had limits discussed. The Domme went beyond the agreed limits, ignored the safeword, and caused injury. The author didn't pay the remaining amount and is being called an asshole by a friend who's also a Domme.\n\nSo, key points here. The safeword was part of the agreement. When the author dropped the ball, the Domme didn't stop. That's a major breach of protocol in any consensual power exchange scenario. The Domme's actions led to the author being in severe pain and needing a hospital visit. The author didn't pay because the Domme violated the agreed-upon safe word and caused harm. \n\nBut the friend argues that the Domme was just pushing limits, which is part of the dynamic sometimes, and that the author should pay for breaking the equipment. However, the main issue here is the violation of the safeword. In any consensual activity, respecting the safeword is paramount. If the Domme didn't respect that, the session was non-consensual from that point, making her actions abusive rather than consensual play. \n\nThe author's refusal to pay is a response to the Domme's breach of trust and safety. The Domme then threatened to report the author for non-payment after the incident. Legally, the author might have a case if the session was non-consensual, but that's a different angle. Ethically, the Domme's actions were the problem. The author is not in the wrong for not paying because the service wasn't delivered as agreed due to the Domme's failure to follow the safeword. Also, the author suffered harm because of this, so it's reasonable to withhold payment as a form of accountability. \n\nThe friend's opinion that the author is in the wrong seems to downplay the importance of the safeword and the harm caused. In consensual non-consent scenarios, the bottom's well-being and boundaries are crucial. The Domme's responsibility is to prioritize safety and respect the safeword. By ignoring it, she violated the fundamental terms of the session. Therefore, the author's decision not to pay is justified.\n"
