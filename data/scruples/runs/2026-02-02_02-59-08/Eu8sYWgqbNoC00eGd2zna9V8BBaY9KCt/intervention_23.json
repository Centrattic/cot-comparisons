I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who posted the AITA story is in the wrong for not paying the Domme after she ignored his safe word. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The person set up a paid session with a Domme for a specific activity, ballbusting. They agreed on limits, including a safe word (dropping a ball). During the session, the Domme went beyond the agreed intensity, continued after the safe word was triggered, and the person ended up injured. They didn't pay the remaining amount because they felt the Domme was negligent and dangerous. The Domme is now threatening to spread negative information about the person not paying.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but the friend (also a Domme) says the author is a douche for not paying, implying that the Domme should be paid regardless. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not paying.\n\nKey points to consider:\n1. The agreement between them: The Domme was supposed to stop when the safe word was triggered. She didn't, leading to injury.\n2. The contract: The person paid a deposit and agreed to pay the rest. However, the Domme breached the agreement by ignoring the safe word, which was a critical part of their arrangement for safety.\n3. Legal perspective: In a consensual adult service agreement, if one party breaches the contract (Domme not following agreed-upon safety protocols), the other party (the client) might not be obligated to pay the remaining amount. However, this is a grey area because it's a personal service agreement and not a formal legal contract.\n4. Ethical perspective: The Domme's actions caused harm, so the client might argue they have a right to withhold payment. However, the Domme might claim she provided the service and is entitled to payment regardless of the outcome.\n5. The friend's opinion: Another Domme says the client is an asshole for not paying, suggesting that in the community, payment is expected even if there's a disagreement.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, if the Domme violated the agreed-upon terms that led to harm, the client could be justified in withholding payment as a form of recourse. However, in the context of the Domme community, the expectation might be to pay regardless. Legally, without a formal contract, it's tricky, but ethically, the client might be justified in not paying due to the Domme's negligence. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
