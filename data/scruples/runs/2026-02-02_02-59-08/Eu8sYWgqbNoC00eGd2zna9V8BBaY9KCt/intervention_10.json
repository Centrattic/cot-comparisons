I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not paying the Domme after she ignored the safe word. The scenario is about a consensual power exchange situation where safety protocols were supposedly agreed upon. The key points here are the safe word and the aftermath.\n\nFirst, the safe word was supposed to be a ball in their hand. If they dropped it, the Domme should stop immediately. However, the Domme continued kicking even after the safe word was triggered. The author then refuses to pay her, citing the violation of the agreed-upon safety rules. The Domme, on the other hand, claims the author broke her equipment and won't be paid.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, this is a bit tricky. The session was a service agreement, but since it's a private, adult consensual arrangement, there might not be a formal contract. However, the safe word is a crucial part of any consensual power exchange. The Domme's failure to respect the safe word could be considered a breach of trust and safety, which might justify the author not paying. \n\nBut there's also the argument that the author agreed to certain terms, including the session and payment. The Domme might argue that the author caused damage to her equipment, which she could claim as compensation. However, the author's primary issue was the violation of the safe word, leading to potential harm. \n\nEthically, the Domme's actions were dangerous and disregarded the agreed boundaries, which is a serious issue. The author's refusal to pay could be seen as a justified response to the Domme's negligence. However, the author might be expected to handle this through legal channels if necessary, rather than just refusing payment. \n\nIn terms of community standards within the kink community, respecting safe words is paramount. If the Domme didn't adhere to that, the author isn't necessarily wrong for not paying. The Domme's threat to report the author might be an attempt to pressure payment, but that doesn't make her actions right. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the author might not be in the wrong because the Domme violated a critical safety agreement. However, there's a nuance here. If the author had broken the equipment intentionally, that's different, but the Domme's actions led to the accident. The author's priority was safety, which was compromised. Therefore, the answer leans towards B (Not in the wrong).\n"
