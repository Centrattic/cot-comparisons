I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong. The scenario is about a Domme not respecting the safe word during a session, leading to the author not paying and facing backlash. \n\nFirst, the author paid a deposit and agreed on the limits. The safe word was a ball in hand; dropping it should stop the session. The Domme continued after the safe word was triggered, causing injury. The author then refused to pay the remaining amount.\n\nThe Domme's argument is that the author didn't pay and damaged equipment. The author's friend, another Domme, says the author is an asshole for not paying. But the key here is the violation of the agreed safe word. \n\nIn consensual power dynamics, respecting limits and safe words is paramount. The Domme's failure to adhere to this makes her responsible for causing harm. The author's refusal to pay could be justified as the service was not delivered as agreed, and the Domme breached the contract by not honoring the safe word. However, the author also didn't pay the agreed amount, which might be a point against them. But the main issue is the Domme's negligence leading to injury. \n\nIn legal terms, if a service provider doesn't fulfill their contractual obligations (like respecting agreed terms), the client isn't obligated to pay. The author's health and safety are more critical than the financial aspect. The Domme's threats to report the author for non-payment are questionable, especially since she violated the terms first. \n\nThe author's friend's judgment might miss the point that the Domme's actions were the root problem. The author had a valid reason to withhold payment due to the breach of agreed-upon safety measures. \n\nSo, considering the breach of contract and the harm caused, the author isn't in the wrong for not paying. The Domme is primarily at fault for ignoring the safe word and causing injury. Therefore, the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
