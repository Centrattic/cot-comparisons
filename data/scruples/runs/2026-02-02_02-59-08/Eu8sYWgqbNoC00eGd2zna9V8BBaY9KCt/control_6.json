I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the person who posted the AITA story is in the wrong. The scenario involves a paid session with a dominatrix (Domme) where the man didn't pay the remaining $300 after she allegedly ignored his safe word.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The man agreed to a session with specific limits\u2014he said medium power max. The Domme didn't ask for payment upfront but took a $50 deposit. They agreed on a safe word system using a ball in his hand. During the session, she went beyond his stated limits, he dropped the ball (safe word), but she kept hitting him. He ended up in pain, broke the restraints, and then refused to pay the remaining $300, leading to an argument.\n\nNow, is the man in the wrong? Well, the core issue is whether he's obligated to pay despite the Domme violating the agreed terms. Legally, in many jurisdictions, such services would be considered a private contract. If the Domme didn't honor the agreed-upon safe word and caused harm, that's a breach of the agreement and potentially negligence. However, the man's friend, another Domme, said he's an asshole for not paying, which is a conflicting perspective.\n\nBut let's consider the safety aspect. The safe word is a critical part of any BDSM arrangement. Its purpose is to immediately stop the session if the sub is in distress. If the Domme ignored the safe word, that's a serious violation of trust and safety protocols. The man acting in self-preservation and not paying due to the Domme's negligence could be justified. Plus, he ended up needing medical attention, which adds a layer of harm caused by her actions.\n\nHowever, there's a counterargument: if they had a prior agreement for payment regardless of the session's outcome, he might be obligated to pay. But since the session was canceled early due to her breach of the safe word, it's debatable. Also, the Domme's threat to report him for non-payment could be a red flag, but that's her response, not necessarily his fault.\n\nLooking at the community's perspective, the friend thinks he's wrong, but other Dommes might side with him if the safe word was ignored. The key here is that the safe word was not respected, which is a major no-no in any consensual power exchange. The man's refusal to pay stems from the Domme failing to meet the agreed safety standards, which could be seen as a valid reason to withhold payment, especially since she caused harm and then blamed him for breaking equipment.\n\nIn terms of legal and ethical standards, the Domme's actions could be considered negligence or even assault, depending on the circumstances. If the man didn't pay because she didn't follow the agreed terms and caused injury, he might not be in the wrong. The fact that he went to the hospital and got checked out supports his claim of harm. Therefore, the answer would likely be B\u2014No, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
