I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The user wants a yes or no answer based on the situation described.\n\nFirst, the author paid a deposit and agreed on terms with the domme, including a safe word (the ball). The safe word was supposed to stop the session immediately if he dropped it. During the session, the domme went beyond the agreed intensity (medium) and continued after he dropped the ball. The author ended up in severe pain, had to break the restraints, and went to the hospital. He refused to pay the remaining amount, and the domme is threatening to report him to the community.\n\nThe key points here are the agreed-upon safe word and the domme violating the terms by continuing after the safe word was triggered. The author's friend, who is also a domme, thinks he's the asshole because he didn't pay and broke the restraints. But that friend's opinion might be biased or not considering the safety issues.\n\nIn terms of legal and ethical considerations, the domme failed to honor the agreed safe word, which is a standard safety measure in such activities. By continuing after the safe word was triggered, she endangered the client's safety. The author's refusal to pay could be justified because the service was not delivered as agreed, and there was a breach of safety. However, there's also the issue of him breaking the restraints, which might be seen as causing damage. But the primary responsibility lies with the domme to adhere to the agreed terms. The author's main wrong, if any, might be in not paying after the breach, but given the potential harm and violation of terms, he's not necessarily in the wrong. So the answer is B.\n"
