I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down the situation here. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The scenario involves a paid session with a Domme (a dominant in a BDSM context) where the sub (the submissive) didn't pay the remaining balance after the Domme allegedly ignored his safe word.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the key points. The sub paid a $50 deposit for a $350 session. The safe word setup was dropping a ball, which he did, but she continued. He ended up with severe pain, went to the hospital, and refused to pay the remaining $300. The Domme then threatened to tell the community he didn't pay. His friend, another Domme, says he's an asshole for not paying.\n\nNow, considering the arguments: The sub's main issue is that the Domme didn't respect the safe word, leading to injury. The Domme's side is that she followed through, maybe pushed his limits, and he's not paying, so she's upset about losing money and equipment.\n\nLegally, if this was a service agreement, not paying could be a breach. But in consensual adult situations, especially kink, there's more nuance. However, the Domme's actions might be a separate issue. If she violated the agreed safe word, which is a fundamental part of consent and safety, then she breached the agreement. That could make the service not delivered properly. The sub's refusal to pay might be justified because the service didn't meet the agreed terms. But the sub could also be wrong for not paying, as the Domme might have expected payment regardless.\n\nEthically, the Domme's actions were dangerous. Ignoring a safe word is a serious violation in kink practices, as it's about safety and trust. If she knew his limits and still exceeded them, causing harm, then she's at fault. The sub's priority is his health, and not paying could be seen as standing up against unsafe practices. However, the payment issue complicates it. If the sub didn't pay, but the Domme didn't provide a safe session, it's a mutual breach.\n\nBut the friend's opinion is that the sub should have paid, which is a common view in some communities where contracts are informal. But the sub's health and safety are paramount. So, is he in the wrong? It's tricky. If the service didn't adhere to the agreed terms, the sub can withhold payment. But if they had a contract, maybe he's obligated. Since it's a cash transaction with a deposit, the terms aren't formal. The Domme's actions were negligent, so the sub's refusal to pay might be justified as the service wasn't properly delivered. Therefore, the answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
