I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this situation. So, the user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The scenario involves a paid session with a domme (a dominant in a sadomasochistic context) where the writer didn't pay because the domme ignored his safe word and caused him significant pain.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The writer set clear limits before the session, including a safe word (dropping a ball). The domme then went beyond the agreed pain level, ignored the safe word after he dropped the ball, and continued causing pain. This led to physical injury, requiring a hospital visit. The domme then demanded payment, and the writer refused, leading to the domme threatening to blackball him in the community.\n\nNow, considering the ethics here. The domme didn't follow the agreed-upon safety protocols, which is a fundamental aspect of consensual power exchange in BDSM. The safe word is a critical part of ensuring that the submissive can stop the activity when they reach their limit. By ignoring it, the domme breached the trust and safety that should be in place. The writer's refusal to pay could be seen as a response to a failure to uphold those safety agreements. However, the writer did agree to pay for the session in advance, except for a deposit, so there's a financial obligation aspect.\n\nBut, in consensual activities like this, the safety and well-being of participants are paramount. If the domme didn't adhere to the agreed terms, the writer might have a valid reason to not pay, as the service provided was not as contracted. The domme's actions could be considered negligent or even abusive, especially given the resulting injury. The writer's friend, a domme herself, argues that the writer should pay despite the injury, which might reflect a different perspective within the community, but that doesn't necessarily make it right. \n\nOn the other hand, the writer did agree to the financial arrangement, so there's a contractual obligation. However, if the service rendered was outside the agreed terms (ignoring the safe word and causing harm), the contract might be voided due to breach of terms. The injury also adds a layer of personal harm, which could justify the writer's decision to not pay as a form of self-defense against further exploitation.\n\nSo, weighing the ethical aspects: the domme's failure to follow safety protocols is a significant breach, and the writer's refusal to pay might be justified as a response to that breach. The writer's health and safety are more critical than the financial obligation, especially since the service was not provided as agreed. Therefore, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
