I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a session between a submissive and a Domme where the Domme ignored the safe word, causing injury. The author didn't pay the Domme after the session because she violated the agreed-upon safeword. The friend, who's also a Domme, says the author was an asshole for not paying her.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what a safeword is. A safeword is a predetermined word or signal that either party can use to stop the activity immediately. It's crucial for consent and safety. In this case, the safe word was dropping the ball. Once the author dropped it, the Domme should have stopped immediately. But she didn't; she continued kicking, leading to injury. That seems like a clear breach of the agreed-upon safety measures.\n\nThe Domme's actions went beyond the agreed intensity (\"medium power max\") and ignored the safeword. She also damaged her own equipment when the author was thrashing. The author refused to pay, citing the Domme's negligence and the injury. The Domme is threatening to report the author for non-payment and damaging equipment.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The friend's argument is that the Domme pushed limits, which is part of the role, and the author should have paid despite the outcome. But the key here is the violation of the safeword. If the safeword is ignored, then the Domme is at fault for not respecting the boundaries set by the sub. Also, the author was injured, which could be a legal issue if the Domme acted negligently. \n\nLegally, if someone causes injury by ignoring a safeword, they could be liable. However, in consensual adult activities, there's usually an implicit or explicit agreement that both parties understand the risks. But in this case, the Domme didn't just take it past the agreed intensity; she ignored the safeword, which is a serious breach. \n\nEthically, the author's refusal to pay might be justified because the service was not performed as agreed. The Domme didn't adhere to the safety protocols, leading to harm. The author's priority should be their health, and not paying could be seen as a reasonable response to prevent the Domme from profiting from a harmful situation. \n\nHowever, the friend's perspective is that the Domme's role is to push limits, even if it's painful. But pushing limits shouldn't override the safeword. The safeword is there to stop the activity when the sub is in pain, not to be ignored. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might not be in the wrong because the Domme violated the agreed terms and caused injury. The author's non-payment is a response to negligence. The Domme's threats about the community and the equipment damage are secondary to the main issue of ignoring the safeword. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
