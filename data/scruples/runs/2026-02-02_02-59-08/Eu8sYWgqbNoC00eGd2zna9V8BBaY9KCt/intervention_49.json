I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario (AITA) is in the wrong. The author set up a paid session with a domme (dominant in a dom/sub dynamic) for a specific activity. They communicated their pain limits and established a safe word mechanism. During the session, the domme ignored the safe word (the dropped ball) and continued beyond the agreed pain level, leading to injury. The author then refused to pay the remaining balance and faced backlash from the domme.\n\nFirst, the safe word is crucial in such scenarios. The author had a system in place for when they needed to stop, and the domme didn't honor it. That's a major issue because ignoring a safe word is a violation of agreed-upon boundaries and safety. The domme's actions led to the author being in severe pain, which could have been avoided if she respected the safe word.\n\nNext, the author didn't pay the remaining $300, which the domme claims she's entitled to. However, since the session was conducted improperly and the domme failed to adhere to the agreed terms, the author's refusal to pay could be justified as the service wasn't delivered as negotiated. The domme's responsibility includes following the established safety protocols, which she didn't. The author's friend, another domme, suggested the author was in the wrong, but maybe she's not considering the breach of the safe word. The key here is mutual agreement and adherence to terms. The author's non-payment is a response to the domme's failure to meet her obligations, so the author might not be in the wrong. \n\nAlso, the author suffered physical harm, which is a significant factor. The domme's actions could be considered negligent, and the author's priority was their health. The author's decision to not pay might be justified as the service was harmful. The domme's threat to report the author for non-payment might not hold weight if the service was unsatisfactory or dangerous. \n\nSo, considering all points, the author isn't in the wrong because the domme didn't follow the agreed safety measures, leading to harm, and the author acted in self-preservation by refusing to pay for a service that was delivered incorrectly.\n"
