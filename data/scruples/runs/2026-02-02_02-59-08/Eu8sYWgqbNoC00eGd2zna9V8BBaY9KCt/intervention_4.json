I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not paying the domme after she ignored the safe word. I need to analyze the situation carefully.\n\nFirst, the context is a consensual power exchange scenario, but things went wrong. The author set up a session with a domme, agreed on a safe word (dropping a ball), and the domme exceeded the agreed-upon intensity despite the safe word being triggered. The author ended up in the hospital and refused to pay, leading to the domme threatening to report non-payment.\n\nThe key points here are consent, boundaries, and the domme's responsibility. In any consensual activity, all parties should respect agreed-upon limits. The safe word is crucial for safety, so if the domme ignored it, that's a serious violation. The author was harmed and sought medical attention, which suggests the situation was dangerous.\n\nThe domme's actions went beyond the agreed limits and caused harm. The author not paying could be seen as a refusal to support someone who breached their agreement and caused injury. The friend's argument that the author should pay because the domme pushed limits assumes that pushing beyond agreed limits is acceptable, which it's not. The author also broke the restraints, which the domme is holding against them, but if the restraints broke due to excessive force, that's on the domme's part.\n\nEthically, the author isn't in the wrong because the domme violated the agreed terms and caused harm. The author prioritized their health and safety, which is the right choice. The domme's threats about the community aren't valid if she breached safety guidelines. So the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
