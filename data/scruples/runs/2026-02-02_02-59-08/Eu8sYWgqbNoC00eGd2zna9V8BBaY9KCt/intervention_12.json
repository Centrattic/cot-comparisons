I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a Domme session where the author didn't pay after the Domme ignored his safe word. Let me break down the details.\n\nFirst, they agreed on a session with a safe word system involving a ball in his hand. He said the safe word was when he dropped the ball. During the session, he started with light kicks but then she escalated to harder ones, beyond what he agreed to. He dropped the ball three times, expecting her to stop, but she kept going. He ended up in severe pain, had to break the restraints, and went to the hospital. The Domme then said he owed her the remaining $300 and threatened to spread negative info if he didn't pay. The author's friend, who's also a Domme, said he was in the wrong because the Domme pushed his limits, and he broke her equipment without paying.\n\nNow, the main issues here are consent, safe words, and payment. The safe word was supposed to stop the session immediately. If the Domme ignored that, she violated the agreed-upon safety measures. The author was in physical distress, which is a red flag. The Domme's actions could be considered negligence or even assault if she didn't stop after the safe word was triggered. \n\nRegarding payment, if the service was not provided as agreed (since she ignored the safe word, which is a fundamental part of the session), then the author isn't obligated to pay the full amount. The Domme's threat to spread negative info is also problematic, as it's a form of harassment or coercion. \n\nThe friend's perspective that he's in the wrong because he didn't pay is missing the point. The core issue is the Domme's failure to respect the safe word and the resulting harm. The broken restraints might be an accident due to the pain, not his fault. So, the author had a valid reason to not pay, especially after being harmed. \n\nIn terms of legal and ethical standards, when a service provider fails to adhere to agreed-upon safety protocols and causes harm, the client isn't obligated to pay. The author's priority was his health, which is reasonable. The Domme's actions were inconsiderate and dangerous, so the author isn't in the wrong for not paying.\n"
