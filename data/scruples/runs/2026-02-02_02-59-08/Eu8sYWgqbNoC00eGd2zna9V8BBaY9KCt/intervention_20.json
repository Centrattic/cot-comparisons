I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not paying the Domme after she ignored his safe word during a session. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author paid $50 as a deposit and agreed to a session with specific limits. The Domme didn't adhere to the agreed-upon limits and continued after the safe word was triggered (dropping the ball). The author didn't pay the remaining $300 and is being accused by his friend of being an asshole.\n\nKey points here: The safe word is a critical agreement in such sessions to ensure safety. The Domme's actions went beyond the agreed limits, leading to injury. The author's refusal to pay is due to her breach of safety protocols. \n\nThe Domme's responsibility is to respect the boundaries set by the sub. By ignoring the safe word and causing harm, she violated that trust. The author's refusal to pay could be seen as justified because the service didn't meet the agreed terms and resulted in physical harm. Additionally, the author sought medical attention, which the Domme didn't offer, indicating she didn't prioritize his well-being. \n\nThe friend's argument that the Domme pushed limits is flawed because pushing beyond agreed limits is unsafe. The author's actions were protective of his health, so he's not in the wrong for not paying after a violation of safety. The Domme's equipment damage was due to the injury, which she caused by not respecting the safe word. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. He had the right to withhold payment after the Domme's negligence led to harm. Answer B.\n"
