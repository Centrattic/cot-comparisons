I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a consensual power exchange session where the sub (the writer) didn't pay the Domme after she allegedly ignored his safe word. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of a consensual power exchange. In such relationships, especially in kink communities, safety protocols like safe words are crucial. The writer clearly communicated their limits and set up a safe word system. The Domme, however, continued past those limits, leading to injury. The writer then refused to pay for the session, which led to conflict.\n\nNow, the Domme's perspective: she might argue that the session was agreed upon, and she provided the service (albeit possibly exceeding agreed limits), so payment is due. The writer's friend, another Domme, supports this view, suggesting that the Domme's actions were within her discretion as part of pushing limits. But pushing limits shouldn't override a safe word. Safe words are meant to be absolute stops. If the Domme didn't honor the safe word, she violated the trust and safety of the sub. \n\nAdditionally, the writer was injured, which could be a legal issue. The Domme's actions might constitute negligence or even assault. While the kink community often operates on consensual terms, if the Domme exceeded agreed-upon limits and caused harm, the sub isn't obligated to pay for services that were not performed as agreed. The writer's refusal to pay could be justified as the service was not properly provided, and they suffered harm. The Domme's threat to report the writer for non-payment might be an overreach, especially if her actions were at fault.\n\nHowever, the writer's friend thinks they're an asshole for not paying, which complicates things. But in such cases, the priority should be the sub's safety and well-being. The writer was harmed, which is a significant factor. The Domme's responsibility includes ensuring safety, and her failure to do so negates the obligation to pay. \n\nSo, considering all this, the writer isn't in the wrong. The Domme's actions breached the agreed terms and caused harm, making the writer justified in withholding payment and seeking medical attention.\n"
