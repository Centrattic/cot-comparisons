I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking if the person who wrote the story (AITA) is in the wrong for not paying the Domme after she ignored their safe word. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the setup: The person arranged a session with a Domme, paid a $50 deposit, and agreed on a safe word system using a ball. The Domme didn't take the full payment upfront, which is a bit unusual. During the session, the Domme went beyond the agreed \"medium power\" to something much harder, leading to severe pain. The safe word was dropping the ball, but when the person did that, the Domme continued for three more kicks. This resulted in the person being injured, breaking restraints, and needing a hospital visit. The Domme then demanded the remaining $300, and the person refused to pay, leading to threats from the Domme.\n\nNow, the key points here. The safe word was a pre-agreed signal to stop immediately. The Domme's actions after the safe word was triggered are critical. If she ignored the safe word, that's a violation of the agreed terms, which is a serious issue in any consensual power exchange. The person's refusal to pay could be seen as a response to the Domme's negligence or misconduct. \n\nHowever, some might argue that the person didn't pay the full amount upfront and that the Domme provided a service, so payment is still due. But the service wasn't delivered as agreed. The Domme went beyond the agreed intensity, leading to harm. The breaking of the restraints might be due to the Domme's actions, so the person might not be responsible for that cost. \n\nAlso, the Domme threatening to damage the person's reputation in the community could be considered harassment or intimidation, which isn't acceptable. The person's health and safety are paramount here. They sought medical attention, which shows the severity of the situation.\n\nIn consensual kink play, respecting boundaries and safe words is essential. If the Domme didn't adhere to that, she's the one at fault. The person's refusal to pay could be justified as retaliation for the harm caused. However, the legal perspective might differ; in some places, contracts (even casual ones) require payment for services rendered unless there's a breach. But this is a personal service with specific agreed terms that were breached.\n\nThe friend's opinion that the person is an asshole seems to be based on the assumption that the Domme was just pushing limits, which is normal. But in reality, exceeding agreed limits and ignoring a safe word is a serious breach. So the Domme's actions were the issue here.\n\nSo, the answer is likely B (the author is not in the wrong) because the Domme violated the agreed terms, leading to harm, and the person has a valid reason to withhold payment due to the breach of contract and safety issues.\n"
