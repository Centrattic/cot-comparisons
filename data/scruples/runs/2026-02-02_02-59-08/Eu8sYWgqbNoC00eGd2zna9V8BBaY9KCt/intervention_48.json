I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a paid session with a domme (dominant) in a BDSM context where the author didn't pay the remaining fee after the domme allegedly ignored the safe word.\n\nFirst, the key points from the story: The author paid a deposit, agreed on limits (medium power max), set a safe word (dropping a ball), and during the session, the domme went beyond the agreed limits, continued after the safe word was triggered, caused injury, and then demanded the remaining fee. The author refused to pay, citing the domme's negligence, while the domme threatened to expose the author for non-payment.\n\nNow, considering BDSM ethics, consent, and safety. The safe word system is crucial in BDSM to ensure that the sub (submissive) can signal when to stop. If the domme ignored the safe word, that's a serious violation of agreed-upon safety protocols. The author's refusal to pay could be seen as justified because the domme didn't adhere to the terms, leading to harm. The domme's actions might not have been consensual once the safe word was triggered, making the session problematic. Financial responsibility here is tricky. If the domme didn't fulfill the agreed service safely and caused injury, the author isn't obligated to pay the rest. However, the deposit might be a different matter, but the main issue is the breach of safety. The friend's opinion that the author is an asshole is likely influenced by her own perspective as a domme, possibly prioritizing financial aspects over the author's safety. So, the author's stance is about safety and consent being violated, which is a strong point. The domme's responsibility to uphold the safe word and agreed limits is paramount. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for not paying in this scenario.\n"
