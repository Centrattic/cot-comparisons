I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not paying the Domme after she ignored his safe word. \n\nFirst, the scenario involves a paid session where the Domme agreed to specific limits. The user set a safe word (dropping a ball) to stop the session if needed. However, when the user's pain exceeded his limits and he dropped the ball, the Domme continued the session. This led to injury, and the user didn't pay the remaining fee, prompting backlash from the Domme.\n\nThe key points here are consent and the agreement terms. The safe word is a critical part of any consensual power exchange. If the Domme ignored the safe word, that breaches the agreed-upon terms. The user's refusal to pay could be seen as a response to a violation of trust and safety. However, some might argue that the user should still pay because the service was provided, regardless of the outcome.\n\nOn the other hand, the Domme's actions caused harm, which could be a legal and ethical issue. The user's decision not to pay might be justified as self-protection and due to the Domme's negligence. The friend's judgment that the user is an asshole might stem from a different perspective on the role of a Domme, where pushing limits is part of the experience. But in this case, the Domme went beyond the agreed limits, leading to injury.\n\nConsidering all this, the user's actions were in response to the Domme's failure to adhere to their mutual agreement. Therefore, the user is not in the wrong.\n"
