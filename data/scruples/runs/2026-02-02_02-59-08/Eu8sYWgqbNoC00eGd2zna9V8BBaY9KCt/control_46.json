I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a paid session with a Domme where the safeword wasn't respected, leading to injury and non-payment.\n\nFirst, the key points here are the safeword and the agreed limits. The author set a medium power max and established a safeword using a ball. When the Domme went beyond the agreed intensity and ignored the safeword (dropping the ball), the author didn't pay. The Domme then threatened retaliation by calling other Doms, which is a red flag. The author's friend, who is also a Domme, argues that the author should have paid regardless, even though the Domme breached the agreed terms and caused harm. \n\nIn consensual power exchange, especially in activities like this, both parties must adhere to the agreed limits and safewords. The Domme's failure to respect the safeword is a violation of the contract, both in terms of trust and physical safety. The author prioritized their health, sought medical attention, and refused to pay for a service that was not performed as agreed. The Domme's actions could be considered negligence or even assault, depending on jurisdiction. \n\nThe friend's argument that the author should pay because the Domme pushed limits is flawed. Pushing limits without respecting the established boundaries and safeword is not part of consensual play. The author isn't at fault here; the Domme is. The non-payment is justified as the service wasn't delivered properly, and the author suffered harm. The threats from the Domme about the community also add to the justification for not paying, as it's an attempt to coerce payment through fear. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the author is not in the wrong. They acted within their rights to protect themselves and seek medical help, and withholding payment is reasonable given the breach of agreement and harm caused.\n"
