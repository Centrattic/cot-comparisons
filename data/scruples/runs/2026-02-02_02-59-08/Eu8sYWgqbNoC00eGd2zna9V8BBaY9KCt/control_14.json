I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not paying the Domme after she ignored his safe word during a session.\n\nFirst, the setup: The user paid a deposit, discussed limits (medium power max), and agreed on a safe word (dropping a ball). The Domme didn't follow his safe word, continued past his limit, caused him significant pain, and then he refused to pay the remaining amount. She's threatening him with community backlash for not paying.\n\nNow, key points. The safe word system is crucial in such activities for safety. The Domme ignored the safe word, went beyond agreed limits, and caused injury. The user didn't pay because he felt it was unsafe and ended up needing medical attention. The Domme claims the user broke her equipment and didn't pay, while the user claims she violated the agreed terms.\n\nLegally and ethically, if a service provider doesn't follow agreed-upon safety measures and causes harm, the client may not be obligated to pay. The user's priority was his health, which is valid. The Domme's actions were negligent, and the user's refusal to pay in this context isn't wrong. The friend's opinion that the user is an asshole is likely influenced by the community's perspective, but that doesn't make the user wrong. The Domme's use of threats for non-payment is also concerning.\n\nSo, considering the violation of agreed terms, the harm caused, and the context of the safe word being ignored, the answer leans towards the user not being in the wrong.\n"
