I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a consensual role-play scenario between a Domme and a sub, but things went wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the key points are. The author paid a deposit, set up a session with a safe word (the ball), which was supposed to stop the session if he dropped it. However, the Domme continued even after he dropped the ball, causing him significant pain. He ended up hurt, went to the hospital, and didn't pay the remaining fee. The Domme is upset and threatening to report him. His friend, who is another Domme, says he's in the wrong because the Domme was just pushing his limits and he damaged her equipment.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether the author is at fault for not paying. The safe word was a pre-agreed signal to stop, which was ignored. The Domme continued beyond the agreed limits, leading to injury. In consensual power exchange activities, respecting safe words is crucial. If the safe word was ignored, that's a major breach of trust and safety protocols. The author didn't pay because the Domme didn't follow the agreed terms and caused harm. The argument from the friend that he still should pay might be based on the idea that the session was conducted and the equipment was broken, but if the Domme didn't adhere to the agreed safety measures, that could negate the obligation to pay.\n\nAlso, the author's actions of not paying might be justified because the service didn't meet the agreed terms. The safe word was a contractual agreement, and violating that could make the remaining payment unnecessary. The Domme's behavior was reckless, leading to injury, which is a serious matter. The author prioritized his health over the payment, which seems reasonable. The friend's judgment might be biased or not considering the violation of safety protocols.\n\nIn terms of legal and ethical perspectives, if there was a clear agreement on the safe word and it was ignored, the Domme could be liable for the harm caused. The author's decision not to pay could be seen as a response to the breach of contract. Additionally, the Domme threatening the author for not paying might be an attempt to coerce payment despite her own fault.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong because the Domme violated the agreed-upon safety terms, leading to harm, and he had the right to decline payment under those circumstances.\n"
