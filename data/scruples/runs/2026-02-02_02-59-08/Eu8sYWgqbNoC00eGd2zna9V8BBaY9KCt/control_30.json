I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not paying the domme after she ignored the safe word. The situation involves a consensual power exchange scenario, but the domme went beyond the agreed limits and ignored the safe word, leading to the author seeking medical attention.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the concept of a safe word. In any consensual activity, especially in power dynamics like this, the safe word is a critical agreement to ensure that the participant can signal they want the activity to stop. The domme's responsibility is to respect that safe word immediately. If she ignored it, that's a violation of the agreed terms and could be considered negligence or even assault, depending on the circumstances.\n\nThe author paid a deposit and agreed to a session with specific limits. The domme exceeded those limits, leading to injury. The safe word was supposed to stop the activity when the author was in pain beyond the agreed level. By ignoring the safe word, the domme failed in her duty to the author's well-being, which is a key part of any consensual power exchange. The fact that the author had to break restraints to stop the session shows the level of distress and potential danger.\n\nNow, the domme is demanding payment for the session and threatening the author. The author's friend (another domme) argues that the author should pay because the domme pushed limits, which is part of the role, and the author damaged equipment. However, this seems like a conflict where the domme breached the agreed terms. The author's refusal to pay could be justified because the service was not delivered as negotiated, and the domme failed to adhere to the safety protocols they had set. Additionally, the author was harmed, which might nullify the contract or obligation to pay if it was a breach of agreed terms or even illegal activity.\n\nIn terms of legal and ethical standards, if the safe word was part of the explicit agreement, and the domme ignored it, she could be liable for any harm caused. The author's decision not to pay could be seen as a valid response to a breach of contract or negligence. The author's friend's perspective might stem from a different understanding of the role, but the key issue here is the violation of the safe word, which is a fundamental part of consent and safety in such activities.\n\nTherefore, the author is not in the wrong because the domme failed to respect the agreed-upon boundaries, leading to harm. The author's refusal to pay is justified as the service was not delivered properly and there was a violation of trust and safety protocols.\n"
