I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a paid dominatrix session where the author didn't pay the remaining $300 after the domme allegedly ignored his safe word. The domme used restraints and a ball gag, and when the author dropped the ball (safe word), she didn't stop, leading to injury and hospitalization. He refuses to pay, and the domme threatens to report him in the community. His friend, another domme, says he's wrong for not paying.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The safe word is a critical safety mechanism in BDSM. The author set up the session with clear limits (medium power max) and a safe word. The domme exceeded those limits, ignored the safe word, and caused injury. The author then refused to pay, which the domme and friend see as unethical because the session wasn't completed, and he damaged equipment. \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, if the service wasn't delivered as agreed, the client isn't obligated to pay the full amount. However, in the kink community, there might be unspoken norms about payment regardless of issues. Ethically, the domme violated agreed-upon safety protocols, leading to harm. The client's refusal to pay could be seen as justified because the service breached the terms. The author's friend, being a domme, might prioritize payment over the client's safety, which is a concerning norm. \n\nBut the author's actions (not paying) might be seen as breaking the contract. However, the contract was violated first by the domme. The safe word being ignored is a major breach, and the injury adds weight. The client's priority was safety, which was compromised, so not paying could be justified. Alternatively, in some communities, contracts are strict, and non-payment could be seen as unethical despite the breach.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the initial contract was honored. Since the domme violated the agreed safety terms, leading to harm, the author isn't in the wrong for refusing payment. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
