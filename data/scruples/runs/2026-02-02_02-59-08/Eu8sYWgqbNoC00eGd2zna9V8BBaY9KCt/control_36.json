I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is at fault for not paying the Domme after she ignored their safe word. \n\nFirst, the setup: The person paid a deposit and set up a session with a Domme. They agreed on limits for ballbusting, and the safe word was dropping a ball. During the session, the Domme went beyond the agreed \"medium\" power, leading to the person dropping the safe word ball but her continuing. This caused injury-like symptoms, and after breaking restraints, the person left without paying the remaining fee. The Domme claims they should pay and might report them, while the friend says they're in the wrong.\n\nNow, considering the key points: The safe word system is standard in such practices to ensure safety. If the Domme ignored the safe word (by continuing after the ball was dropped), that's a serious breach of agreed terms and safety. The user's main argument is that the Domme didn't respect their limits, leading to pain and injury. The friend's stance is less important here; the question is about the user's fault.\n\nLegally and ethically, if a service provider fails to follow agreed-upon safety protocols, they could be considered negligent. The user's refusal to pay the remaining amount could be seen as a legitimate response to a breach of contract or terms. However, the deposit part complicates things. The user paid a $50 deposit, so maybe the remaining $300 is a point of contention. If the session was canceled due to the Domme's fault, the user might be justified in withholding payment. \n\nBut the friend argues that the Domme was just pushing limits, but pushing beyond agreed limits is problematic. The user had the right to stop the session due to the Domme's negligence. Also, the user went to the hospital, indicating genuine harm, which supports their decision not to pay. \n\nThe Domme's intent to report the user for non-payment might be retaliatory. The user's actions were in self-preservation and safety. Therefore, the user isn't in the wrong for not paying when the service provider violated safety agreements.\n"
