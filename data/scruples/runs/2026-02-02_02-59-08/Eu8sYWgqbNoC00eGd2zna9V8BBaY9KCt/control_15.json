I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a Domme session where the author didn't pay after the Domme ignored his safe word. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the author set up a session with clear boundaries. He mentioned his limits for ballbusting as medium max. The Domme agreed to restrain and gag him, and they set up a safe word system using a ball in his hand. If he dropped it, she was supposed to stop. That seems like a standard safety measure in BDSM play. \n\nDuring the session, the Domme went beyond the agreed intensity. He said she escalated to the point where she kicked him hard even though he specified medium power. When he dropped the ball (the safe word), she didn't stop. That's a big deal because the whole point of a safe word is to halt the activity immediately when the sub is in pain or wants to stop. Ignoring the safe word is a serious breach of trust and safety protocols. \n\nThe author then had a medical emergency, his testicles swelled and he had to go to the hospital. He decided not to pay the remaining $300, and the Domme threatened to report him to the community. His friend, who's also a domme, said he was in the wrong for not paying and for breaking her equipment. \n\nNow, the key points here: Did the Domme violate the agreed terms by ignoring the safe word and exceeding the agreed limits? If she did, then she's at fault for not respecting the boundaries. The author's refusal to pay could be justified if she breached the agreement. However, in some communities, there might be expectations that you pay regardless of issues, which could complicate things. But from a standard ethical standpoint, if someone doesn't honor your safe word and causes harm, they're violating the trust and safety, which is a major issue. \n\nThe friend's opinion might be influenced by community norms where payment is expected, but that doesn't necessarily make it right. The author's health and safety are paramount. In any consensual activity, the bottom line is that agreed-upon safewords must be respected. If they aren't, it's not consensual anymore. \n\nSo, considering all that, the Domme was in the wrong for ignoring the safe word and causing harm. The author acted responsibly by stopping the session, seeking medical help, and not paying for a service that was not delivered properly. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
