I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not paying the Domme after she ignored their safe word.\n\nFirst, the context: The person had a session with a Domme where they agreed on a safe word system. The safe word was dropping a ball, which would signal the Domme to stop. The Domme didn't stop when the person dropped the ball, went beyond their agreed limits, and caused them pain. The person ended up in the hospital, and the Domme is now charging them for broken equipment and not paying the remaining fee.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics here. The key points are the violation of the safe word, which is a critical part of any consensual power exchange. The Domme was supposed to stop immediately when the safe word was used, but she didn't. That's a serious breach of trust and safety. Also, she continued to inflict pain beyond the agreed limits, which is a form of non-consensual harm. \n\nThe person not paying the remaining $300 could be seen as justified because the Domme didn't provide the agreed-upon service as per their contract. The broken restraints were a result of the Domme's actions, not the person's fault. The Domme's claim about losing money from broken equipment seems invalid since she was the one who failed to follow the agreed terms. \n\nThe friend, who is also a Domme, said the person was an asshole for not paying, but that's probably from the perspective of the Domme community expecting payments regardless. However, the ethical aspect here is about safety and consent. The writer has a right to prioritize their health and safety over payment when the service provider violated the terms. \n\nSo, the Domme's actions were negligent and harmful, and the person is not obligated to pay for services that were not properly delivered. They also have the right to seek medical attention without financial penalty for the provider's faults. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
