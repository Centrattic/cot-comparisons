I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a dominatrix (domme) session where the author didn't pay the domme after she allegedly ignored his safe word, leading to injuries.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author agreed to a session with a domme, set up a safe word (dropping a ball) for when the pain becomes too much. During the session, the domme went beyond the agreed medium power, and even after the safe word was triggered (the ball was dropped), she continued the assault. The author ended up injured, went to the hospital, and refused to pay the remaining fee. The domme is threatening to report him to the community for non-payment. The author's friend, who is also a domme, says he's an asshole for not paying.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics of a consensual power exchange scenario, safety protocols like safe words are crucial. Both parties are supposed to respect the limits set. The domme's role is to ensure the sub's well-being within the agreed boundaries. If the domme ignored the safe word and caused harm, that's a breach of trust and safety. The author's refusal to pay could be seen as justified if the domme violated the agreed terms and caused harm. However, from the domme's perspective, she might argue that the session was agreed upon and the payment is due regardless of what happened.\n\nBut the key issue here is the violation of the safe word protocol. In any consensual arrangement, especially in activities with inherent risks, respecting the safe word is paramount. If the domme continued after the safe word was triggered, that's negligence and could be considered a violation of the agreed terms. The author prioritized his health and safety, which is understandable. The domme's actions led to injury, so the author's decision not to pay might be justified as a response to the domme's failure to uphold her end of the agreement.\n\nHowever, there's a counterpoint: the domme might have a contract or expectation of payment regardless of the session's outcome. But in a scenario where the service provider fails to deliver the service as agreed (i.e., respecting the safe word and not causing harm), the client might have a valid reason to withhold payment. Also, the author suffered injuries, which could be a legal matter beyond just payment, but that's outside the scope here.\n\nThe friend's opinion that the author is an asshole for not paying seems to stem from the assumption that payment is due regardless, but that overlooks the domme's failure to provide the agreed service safely. The author's main grievance is the domme's disregard for his safety, leading to harm. Therefore, the author's refusal to pay isn't just about money but about the domme's breach of trust and safety protocols.\n\nIn conclusion, the author is not in the wrong because the domme violated the agreed safe word, leading to his injury. The author's decision to prioritize his health and withhold payment under these circumstances is justified. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
