I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. So, the question is whether the author is at fault in not paying the Domme after she ignored his safe word. First, I need to understand the situation properly.\n\nThe user set up a session with a Domme (a dominant partner in a BDSM context) for $350, paying a $50 deposit. They agreed on a safe word system where if he dropped a ball (since he couldn't speak due to a ball gag), she would stop. But during the session, she went beyond his stated limits (medium power), causing severe pain. He dropped the ball (the safe word trigger) three times, but she kept going. He ended up in the hospital with swollen testicles, and now he refuses to pay the remaining $300. The Domme is threatening to report him to the community for not paying, and his friend (who's also a Domme) says he's in the wrong because the Domme pushed his limits, and he broke her equipment.\n\nSo, the main points are: Did the Domme violate agreed-upon boundaries by ignoring the safe word? If so, is the user justified in not paying?\n\nIn BDSM practices, safe words are crucial for communication and consent. The user clearly stated his limits and the safe word system. The Domme ignored the safe word, leading to physical harm. That seems like a serious breach of trust and safety. The user's health and safety are paramount here. The Domme also didn't follow through on the agreed terms, which undermines the consensual nature of the session.\n\nHowever, the user didn't pay the full amount upfront. He paid a deposit, but maybe the deposit was part of the agreement. If the service wasn't completed as agreed (i.e., she didn't follow the safe word protocol), then he might not be obligated to pay the remaining balance. The user's friend argues that the Domme pushed limits, but pushing limits can be part of the consensual play, but only if communication is respected. Since the user used the safe word and she ignored it, that's a violation.\n\nOn the other hand, the user didn't pay the full amount. If the contract was that $50 deposit and $300 upon completion, and he didn't finish the session, maybe he's not responsible for the rest. However, sometimes in such services, the payment is due regardless unless there's a breach by the provider. But in this case, the Domme breached the agreement by not respecting the safe word, causing harm. That makes the user's refusal to pay justified because the service was not performed correctly, and he suffered harm. The Domme might also be in the wrong for not following the agreed terms and endangering the user.\n\nSo, considering all that, the user is not in the wrong for not paying because the Domme violated the agreed-upon safety measures, leading to his injury. Therefore, the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
