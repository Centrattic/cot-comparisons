I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a paid session with a Domme where the author didn't pay the remaining amount after the Domme ignored their safe word, leading to injury.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The Domme was supposed to stop when the safe word was triggered, which in this case was dropping a ball. The author dropped the ball (their limit) multiple times, but the Domme continued, causing them significant pain and injury. The author then refused to pay the remaining $300, and the Domme is threatening to spread negative info about them.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether the author was in the wrong for not paying. The Domme's argument is that she provided the service and the author didn't pay. The author's argument is that the Domme violated the agreed-upon safe word, causing harm, so they have a right to not pay.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, contracts are usually enforceable even if they're for services like this. However, if the service was not delivered as agreed, the client might not be obligated to pay. But the problem here is that the Domme did provide the service, even if she didn't follow the agreed-upon safety protocols. The author's friend, who is also a Domme, says the author is in the wrong for not paying, implying that the Domme's actions were within her discretion as a Domme pushing limits. But in a consensual power exchange, there are usually strict rules about safe words. Ignoring a safe word is a serious breach of trust and safety.\n\nEthically, the Domme's actions could be considered negligent or even abusive. The safe word system is crucial for consent-based activities. By ignoring it, she potentially caused harm, which could be seen as a violation of the agreement. If the Domme didn't follow the agreed terms, the service wasn't delivered as contracted, which could justify the author not paying. However, this is a gray area. Legally, the author might still be obligated to pay unless there was a specific clause about safe word non-compliance. But in ethical terms, the Domme's actions were wrong, so the author isn't necessarily at fault for withholding payment due to the violation of safety terms.\n\nAnother angle: the author didn't pay because the service was harmful. If the Domme breached the contract by not adhering to the agreed-upon safe word, then the contract isn't fulfilled, so the author isn't required to pay. The friend's argument that the Domme pushed limits as part of the role might be part of the Domme's discretion, but if the safe word was clearly communicated and ignored, that's a separate issue.\n\nAlso, the author suffered physical harm, which could be a factor. If the Domme's actions were negligent, the author might have a case for not paying, especially if they can show that the service was not performed as agreed. However, in many jurisdictions, once the service is rendered, payment is expected unless there's a breach. But in this case, the breach was by the Domme, not the client.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would likely be B (the author is not in the wrong) because the Domme failed to follow the agreed safety protocols, leading to harm, which voids the obligation to pay. The author's friend being a Domme might have a different perspective based on community norms, but legally and ethically, the Domme's actions were the problem.\n"
