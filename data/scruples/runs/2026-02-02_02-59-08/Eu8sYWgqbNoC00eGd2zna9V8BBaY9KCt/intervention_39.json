I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a domme session where the author didn't pay because the domme ignored his safe word.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the roles and expectations in a domme/submissive dynamic. A safe word is crucial for safety, so when the domme ignored the safe word, that's a major issue. The author said the safe word was dropping a ball, and when he did that, she kept going. That's dangerous and against the agreed-upon boundaries.\n\nThe domme breached the trust by not respecting the safe word, leading to injury. The author didn't pay because the service wasn't delivered safely. However, the payment was for the session, and he got the session even if it was harmful. The domme's actions were negligent, but the author not paying might be justified if the service was unsafe. However, non-payment could be seen as not honoring the agreement unless there was a breach in contract.\n\nThe friend's perspective is that the domme pushed limits, but the safe word is non-negotiable. The domme's responsibility is to stop immediately upon the safe word. The author's health was compromised, which is serious. The domme's response of calling the community and threatening him adds to her misconduct.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the domme is at fault for ignoring the safe word, leading to harm. The author is in the right for not paying due to the breach of safety. But some might argue he should pay because the session was provided, even if improperly. However, the safety violation makes the session dangerous, so the author isn't obligated to pay. Also, the author breaking the restraints might be a factor, but the domme's neglect was the primary issue.\n\nConsidering all points, the author might not be in the wrong because the domme violated the agreed-upon safety measures, leading to harm. The non-payment is a response to the unsafe service. However, there's a counter-argument about contractual obligations. But given the health risk, the author's action is understandable. So the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
