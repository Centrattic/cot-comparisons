I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong (AITA) for not paying a Domme after she ignored his safe word during a session. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The user paid a deposit and arranged a session with a Domme. They agreed on a safe word using a ball\u2014dropping it would stop the session. However, the Domme continued after he dropped the ball, causing severe pain and injury. He didn't pay the remaining fee and faced backlash from her.\n\nNow, the key points here are consent and safety protocols. The user set clear limits and had a safe word in place. The Domme not only pushed beyond his stated maximum (medium power) but also ignored the safe word, leading to physical harm. This is a serious issue because in any consensual role-play scenario, the safe word is paramount. Ignoring it breaches trust and safety, which should override the payment expectation.\n\nThe Domme's actions could be considered negligence or even assault, depending on jurisdiction. The user's decision not to pay could be seen as justified because the service provided was harmful and violated agreed terms. Additionally, the user went to the hospital, which shows the incident had real consequences, further supporting that the Domme was at fault.\n\nThe friend's argument that the user is the asshole for not paying is questionable. If the Domme didn't follow the agreed-upon boundaries, the user isn't obligated to pay for services that were harmful and not as negotiated. The broken restraints and the Domme's reaction to that might be her responsibility too if she didn't use proper equipment.\n\nIn conclusion, the user isn't in the wrong. The Domme failed to uphold the agreed safety measures and caused harm, making the user's refusal to pay justified. So the answer should be B.\n"
