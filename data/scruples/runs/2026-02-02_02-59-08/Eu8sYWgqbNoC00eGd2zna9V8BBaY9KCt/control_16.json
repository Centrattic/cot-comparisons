I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a paid domination session where the domme (dominant) ignored the sub's safe word, leading to injury. The author didn't pay the remaining $300 and is facing backlash from the domme community.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The setup was a 90-minute session for $350. The user paid a $50 deposit upfront. They discussed limits, agreed on a safe word mechanism (dropping a ball), but when the user dropped it, the domme didn't stop. Instead, she continued, causing injury. The user then left without paying the rest and went to the hospital. The domme is threatening to report them for non-payment and damaging equipment.\n\nThe friend, who's a domme, says the user is an asshole for not paying, arguing that the domme pushed limits as part of the role. The user is asking if they're in the wrong.\n\nSo, the main issue here is the safety and adherence to agreed-upon rules. The safe word is a critical part of any consensual power exchange. If the domme ignored it, that's a breach of the agreement and could be considered negligence, especially leading to injury. The user not paying after being harmed could be seen as justified, as the service didn't meet the agreed terms. However, the user did cause damage to equipment (breaking restraints) and didn't pay, which the domme is claiming as losses. \n\nBut consent and safety should be the priority. If the domme violated the safe word, which is a non-negotiable boundary, then the user isn't responsible for the remaining payment. The domme's actions led to harm, so the user's refusal to pay is a valid response. The friend's perspective that pushing limits is part of the role doesn't hold if the domme went beyond the agreed limits and ignored the safe word, which is supposed to stop the session immediately. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong for not paying because the domme breached the agreement by not respecting the safe word, causing injury. The user's safety took precedence, and they had the right to terminate the session and seek medical help. The domme's threats to report the user for non-payment are invalid if she didn't provide the agreed service safely. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
