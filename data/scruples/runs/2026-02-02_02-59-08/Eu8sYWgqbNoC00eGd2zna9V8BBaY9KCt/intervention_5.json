I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a Domme who was paid a deposit and the client who didn't pay the rest after an incident.\n\nFirst, the key points here are the safe word being ignored. The client set up a safe word system with the ball, which the Domme didn't stop when he dropped it. Then she continued to kick him beyond his agreed limit, causing injury. He didn't pay the remaining $300, and the Domme threatened to report him. His friend, another Domme, says he's in the wrong for not paying and breaking the equipment.\n\nThe user initially thought the author is in the wrong but wants confirmation. So, the main ethical considerations here are consent, safety, and financial responsibility.\n\nIn terms of consent and safety, the Domme violated the agreed-upon safe word. That's a serious issue because the safe word is supposed to protect the sub. By ignoring it, she acted recklessly and caused harm. That makes her at fault for not following the agreed limits. The client's decision not to pay could be justified because the service was not performed as agreed, and he was harmed. Also, the equipment breaking might be due to the Domme's negligence if she was exceeding agreed intensity.\n\nFinancial responsibility: The client paid a deposit, but the main service wasn't delivered correctly. He might not be obligated to pay the full amount, especially since he was injured. However, the deposit might still be non-refundable. The friend's opinion that he should pay is conflicting, but maybe the friend isn't considering the breach of terms by the Domme.\n\nThreats from the Domme to report him could be intimidation, which is unethical. The client's choice to seek medical help and not pay is a valid response to her negligence. So the client might not be in the wrong here. The answer would likely be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
