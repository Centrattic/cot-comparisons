I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a person who paid a domme (dominant in a BDSM context) for a session, but the domme ignored his safe word, causing him a lot of pain. The author didn't pay the remaining $300 and is now being called out by a friend who's a domme too. The question is whether the author is at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author set up a session with clear limits: he wanted light to medium ballbusting. The domme started with kicks that got harder than agreed, and when he dropped the safe word (a ball), she didn't stop. He ended up in the hospital but no permanent damage. He didn't pay the rest, and the domme is upset about that and the broken restraints.\n\nNow, considering consent and boundaries in BDSM. The whole premise of BDSM is consensual activities with agreed-upon limits and safe words. The safe word is supposed to stop everything immediately. If the domme ignored the safe word, that's a major violation. The author's safety should come first, and the contract for the session would be nullified once the safe word was used and ignored. The domme's actions were negligent and dangerous, so the author isn't obligated to pay for a service that was not performed as agreed and caused harm.\n\nThe friend's argument is that he should pay because the domme pushed his limits. But pushing limits isn't an excuse for ignoring the safe word. The safe word is non-negotiable. The author's refusal to pay is justified because the service was not delivered properly, and he was harmed. The broken restraints might be a separate issue, but the domme's failure to stop upon the safe word being triggered is the main problem. So the author isn't in the wrong here. Answer B."
