I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a person who paid a domme for a session, set up a safe word using a ball, and during the session, the domme ignored the safe word when he dropped the ball, leading to severe pain and injury. The author then refused to pay the remaining $300 and is being called a bad person by a friend who's also a domme.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics of a Domme/submissive relationship, especially regarding safety words. Safety words are crucial in such scenarios because they're agreed upon to stop the session immediately if the sub is in too much pain or discomfort. The author specified a medium power max, and the domme exceeded that, leading to injury despite the safe word being triggered. \n\nThe key points here are: \n1. The safe word was in place and clearly communicated. \n2. The domme ignored the safe word (the ball being dropped) and continued, causing harm. \n3. The author didn't pay the remaining amount because the domme breached the agreed-upon safety protocols and caused injury. \n4. The domme accused the author of not paying, leading to a conflict.\n\nNow, considering the domme's responsibility: She's supposed to prioritize the sub's safety and follow the agreed limits. Ignoring the safe word is a serious breach of trust and safety. The author's friend, another domme, says the author is an asshole because he didn't pay and broke the equipment. But in this case, the equipment was broken due to the domme's actions, perhaps as a result of pushing too hard. If the domme violated the safety protocol, the author has a right to withhold payment as the service didn't meet the agreed terms. Additionally, the author sought medical attention, which is a valid reason for concern.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the author had an agreement to pay, and by not fulfilling the payment, he's breaking the contract. But the contract's terms were based on the domme providing a safe, consensual session. If she failed to do that, the author might not be obligated to pay. Also, the domme threatened to report him, which could be a tactic to pressure payment, but if she was at fault, the author has a defense.\n\nSo, considering that the domme ignored the safe word and caused harm, the author's refusal to pay might be justified. The domme's responsibility to follow safety protocols is paramount, and her failure to do so makes her at least partially at fault. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
