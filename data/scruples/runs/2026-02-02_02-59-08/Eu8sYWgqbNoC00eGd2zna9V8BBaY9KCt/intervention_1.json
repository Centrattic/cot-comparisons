I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a consensual dominatrix session where the sub didn't pay after the Domme ignored his safe word.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The sub paid a deposit and arranged a session with clear limits\u2014medium power max. The Domme used restraints and a ball gag, and the safe word was dropping a ball. The Domme went beyond the agreed limits, causing significant pain, and ignored the safe word. The sub didn't pay the remaining amount, leading to the Domme threatening to report him to the community.\n\nNow, legal and ethical considerations. In consensual D/s dynamics, safety words are crucial. If the Domme ignored the safe word, that's a major breach of trust and safety. The sub's health was compromised, and he went to the hospital. The Domme's actions could be considered negligence, especially if she didn't act on the safe word which was a pre-agreed signal to stop.\n\nThe friend (who's also a domme) says the sub is an asshole for not paying. But from a safety standpoint, the sub's refusal to pay might be justified because the Domme violated their agreement and caused harm. The sub isn't obligated to pay for services if the service was not as agreed. Plus, the Domme's threat to report him for non-payment could be seen as retaliation for her own misconduct.\n\nHowever, in some consensual adult services, payment is expected regardless of the outcome, similar to a contract. If the Domme followed all the agreed terms (which she didn't), the sub would have to pay. But here, she didn't adhere to the limits and ignored the safe word, which is a critical part of the agreement. The sub's health and safety should take precedence over financial obligations in such cases.\n\nAlso, the sub didn't pay the full amount upfront, which might be standard in their community. The deposit might be non-refundable, but if the service was not rendered properly, maybe he's not obligated to pay the rest. The key here is whether the Domme's actions were a breach of the agreed terms, making the sub's refusal to pay justified.\n\nIn conclusion, the Domme is at fault for ignoring the safe word and causing harm. The sub's refusal to pay is a response to her negligence, so he's not in the wrong.\n"
