I contacted this really smkoin' domme and set up a session for 90 mins for $350, not bad for a experienced hot domme. I met up with her at her place on Saturday and surprisingly she didn't ask for the money up front, which they usually all do. I did however give a deposit of $50 to her and we spoke for about 5 mins of my limits with ballbusting. I said medium power max, and she asked to restrain and ball gag me and I agreed to this. The \"safe word\" word be me holding a ball in my hand and if I drop it she'd stop immediately and ungag me and check my status. I thought this was good and safe, about 10 mins in she's kicking kinda hard, my balls kill. 20 mins in she's kneeing really hard and I'm in a lot of pain, she steps back and boots me full force in the balls even though I said med power max. I'm dying at this point and drop the ball expecting her to stop, but she keeps kicking 3 more kicks as powerful as the first. I basically almost pass out and felt like I couldn't breathe and was choking. I'm thrashing around hard and break one of the restraints and cover myself before she gets another one in. I cover myself up and she stops and starts yelling at me for breaking her equipment while unrestraining me, I hit the ground holding myself and I knew something was wrong with my berries. I gather all my strength to get up and she says she's ending the session now and to give her the $300 I owe her. I slowly put my clothes back on and tell her she ignored my safeword and was dangerous, and I'm going to the hospital now and will not be paying her. She starts berating me and goes on the phone to call someone and said that she's going to tell the domme community in my city about me not paying and I wont ever get another session. I limp out of there quick and into my car and straight to the hospital. My balls are normally walnut sized but they doubled from that so I was scared af, not to mention the pain. Thankfully nothing was damaged down there and I'm recovering well.\n\nI told my friend about this the next day and she's a domme as well and we sometimes play, she said I'm a huge asshole/douche and should have paid her still. Said that she pushed my limits like any good domme and that I didn't pay her and broke her straps which caused her to lose a lot. \n\nAITA? Also please don't judge me lmao, I know it's a weird fetish.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this scenario is at fault. The situation involves a dominatrix (Domme) session where the submissive didn't pay after the Domme ignored his safe word, leading to injury.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The submissive set up a session with clear limits and a safe word. The safe word was dropping a ball, but when he did that, the Domme continued, causing severe pain and injury. He then refused to pay the remaining $300 and is being told by a friend (also a Domme) that he's in the wrong for not paying and for damaging the equipment.\n\nThe question is whether the author is at fault. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nIn consensual power exchange, safety protocols are crucial. The safe word is supposed to stop the session immediately. If the Domme ignored the safe word, that's a serious breach. The submissive has the right to withdraw consent if boundaries are violated. \n\nLegally, if the Domme caused harm by ignoring the safe word, the submissive might not be liable for the agreed-upon payment, as the contract wasn't honorably fulfilled. The Domme's actions could be considered negligent. The friend's argument that he should pay because the Domme pushed his limits ignores that the Domme didn't respect the agreed-upon safety measures. \n\nEthically, the Domme is responsible for adhering to the safe words. The submissive's refusal to pay is a response to a violation of trust and safety. Also, the damage to the restraints was a result of the Domme's actions, so the cost shouldn't fall on the submissive. \n\nTherefore, the author is not in the wrong. The Domme failed in her duty to follow the safety protocols, leading to harm. The author's decision to seek medical help and not pay is justified.\n"
