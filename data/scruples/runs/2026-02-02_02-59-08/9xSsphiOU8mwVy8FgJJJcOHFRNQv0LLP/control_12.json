I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for not wanting his wife to pursue a career that would make her higher than him. \n\nFirst, the author's main concern is about feeling emasculated if his wife earns more. He mentions that he's the primary breadwinner and it makes him feel good. He also states they don't need more money since they live comfortably. \n\nNow, societal norms often emphasize gender equality, so wanting to be the higher earner might be seen as outdated. The wife had already put her education on hold to support him during his master's, so this could be a chance for her to advance her own goals. Her parents are offering financial support, which removes the burden of tuition costs. \n\nThe author's reasoning is based on his own feelings of self-worth tied to income, which is a personal issue. However, the wife's desire to pursue her dream, despite loving her current job, is her right. The question is whether the author is wrong for prioritizing his feelings over her aspirations.\n\nIn terms of fairness, supporting a partner's career growth is usually encouraged. The author's hesitation seems to stem from insecurity rather than practical concerns. Even though they don't need the money, the wife's educational opportunity is valid. \n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong because his reasons are self-centered and not based on the couple's needs or her personal goals. The answer would likely be A (Yes, he's in the wrong) because his feelings shouldn't override her autonomy and the financial support from her parents makes the decision more about her aspirations rather than financial necessity.\n"
