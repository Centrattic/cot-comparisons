I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the given scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a husband who is against his wife pursuing a career that would make her earn more than him, primarily because he feels emasculated. \n\nFirst, I need to analyze the details. The husband is the main breadwinner, their finances are comfortable, and they don't plan to have kids. The wife had given up her grad school plans to support him during his studies. Now, her wealthy parents are offering to fund her grad education, which would lead to a higher salary. The husband's opposition is based on his own feelings about being the breadwinner, not practical reasons like financial necessity or the wife's well-being.\n\nThe key points here are the husband's motivations. He admits that his main concern is feeling emasculated if his wife earns more. That's a personal insecurity, not a practical issue. The wife is pursuing her own dream, which she loves, even though she's happy in her current job. The husband's stance seems to prioritize his ego over his wife's aspirations and happiness.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the husband's reasoning is based on his own insecurities rather than the couple's best interests. Healthy relationships should support each other's growth. If the husband is hindering his wife's career for his self-esteem, that's a problem. Even though they can live comfortably on his income, the wife's choice to advance her career should be respected. The husband's response isn't about financial strain but about his own feelings, which makes his position ethically questionable.\n\nSo, the answer should be that the author is in the wrong (A). The reasoning is that he's allowing his personal feelings to override his wife's autonomy and aspirations without valid reasons. The wife's decision to pursue her education and career is her right, and the husband should support her unless there's a legitimate concern, which there isn't here.\n"
