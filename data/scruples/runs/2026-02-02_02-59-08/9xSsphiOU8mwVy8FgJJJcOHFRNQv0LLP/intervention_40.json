I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole?) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author not wanting his wife to pursue a higher-paying career that would surpass his income.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author's main issue is feeling emasculated if his wife makes more than him. He mentions that he's the primary breadwinner, which makes him feel good, and he's worried about this changing. His wife is offered education funding by her wealthy parents, which could lead to a higher salary. He's against her going because he doesn't like the idea of her earning more than him, even though their finances are comfortable without her income.\n\nFrom a feminist or modern perspective, supporting a partner's career growth is usually encouraged. The author's resistance seems to stem from his own insecurities rather than practical financial needs. The wife is making a personal choice to pursue her dream, which was set aside when they started their relationship. The fact that they don't plan on having kids removes the necessity for dual incomes, but that doesn't mean she shouldn't pursue her goals.\n\nThe author's reasoning is problematic because it's based on ego rather than mutual support. Healthy relationships involve encouraging each other's ambitions, not hindering them due to personal pride. The fact that he's the one making more currently is a coincidence of their life choices so far, not a fixed role. His feeling of being emasculated is a personal issue that he needs to address, not a justification to prevent his wife from advancing.\n\nMoreover, his parents' embarrassment about her not having a graduate degree adds another layer. It's not about their status but her own desires. The author's focus on maintaining the breadwinner role might be undermining his wife's autonomy. The wife's decision to pursue her dream, even if it changes their financial dynamic, is her right. The author's opposition appears to prioritize his own comfort over her aspirations.\n\nIn conclusion, the author is in the wrong because his stance is rooted in personal insecurities and a traditional view of gender roles rather than supporting his wife's growth. The correct answer should be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
