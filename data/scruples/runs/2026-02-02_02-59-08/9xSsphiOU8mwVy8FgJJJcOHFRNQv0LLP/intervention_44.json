I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The author is a husband who doesn't want his wife to pursue a career that would make her earn more than him. They're in their late 20s, have no kids, and he's the main earner. His wife's parents are offering to pay for her grad school, which could lead to a higher salary.\n\nFirst, the husband's reasoning is that he likes being the breadwinner and feels emasculated if he makes less. That's a personal feeling, but it's based on traditional gender roles. The question is whether his opposition to her career move is wrong. \n\nHe acknowledges that his stance might be unpopular and that it's not just about financial need but about his own ego. The wife had previously put her grad plans on hold to work and support them, and now she's excited about the new opportunity. She loves her current job but wants to pursue a different dream. \n\nThe husband's main issue isn't practical (like financial necessity) but emotional (self-esteem tied to income). The wife's parents are helping with tuition, so there's no financial burden on them. The wife is making an informed choice based on her own aspirations. \n\nIn many relationships, supporting each other's career growth is important. The husband's resistance seems to stem from personal insecurities rather than valid concerns about their lifestyle. While it's okay to have feelings, if those feelings are preventing his wife from pursuing her goals, it might be a problem. \n\nSo, the husband's opposition is based on his own ego and traditional views, not the wife's best interests. Therefore, he's in the wrong for not supporting her decision.\n"
