I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting his wife to pursue a career that would make her earn more than him.\n\nFirst, the author's main concern seems to be about feeling emasculated if his wife's salary exceeds his. He mentions that they live comfortably on his income alone and don't plan to have kids, so there's no financial necessity. However, the emotional aspect is about his self-esteem tied to being the sole breadwinner. \n\nNow, considering societal norms, many people view equality and mutual support in a relationship as important. The wife is interested in a graduate program she's passionate about, which is a valid personal goal. The author's support for her aspirations should ideally be based on her happiness and growth, not on their financial dynamics. \n\nThe fact that he admitted his feelings about the salary and being embarrassed if he makes less suggests that his reasons are more about personal ego than the wife's best interests. Even though he says they can afford it, the decision to pursue education is a personal right and should be respected regardless of income. \n\nThe wife's parents are offering financial support, which removes the burden of paying tuition. The author's initial reaction might be based on outdated notions of gender roles or a lack of confidence in their relationship's foundation beyond financial roles. \n\nWhile the user acknowledges that it's not a popular opinion, the key here is whether the author's stance is wrong. Since the wife is pursuing a dream and the financial aspect is covered, the author should support her. Feeling emasculated in this context is a personal issue that doesn't justify discouraging her from a potentially fulfilling career path. \n\nTherefore, the answer is A because the author is prioritizing his own feelings over his wife's personal and professional growth, which is a key aspect of a healthy relationship.\n"
