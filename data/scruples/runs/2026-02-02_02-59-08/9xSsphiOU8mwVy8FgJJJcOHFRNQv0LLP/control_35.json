I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the husband) is in the wrong for not wanting his wife to pursue a career that would make her earn more than him. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The husband is comfortable with being the sole breadwinner and feels it makes him feel emasculated if his wife makes more. They don't plan to have kids, so there's no financial pressure. His wife's parents are offering to pay for her grad school, which could lead to a higher salary. The husband's main objection is his own feelings about being the breadwinner.\n\nNow, from a moral standpoint, is it wrong for him to feel this way? Well, the wife is choosing her own path, which she's excited about. The husband's reasoning is based on his own insecurities rather than any objective need. Supporting a partner's career choices is generally seen as important in a healthy relationship. His feelings might be valid, but that doesn't make his stance right. It's about his self-worth being tied to his income, which is a personal issue.\n\nThen there's the aspect of equality. In modern relationships, it's common for both partners to have careers and earn similar or different amounts based on their choices. The husband's discomfort stems from traditional gender roles where the man is expected to be the higher earner. However, those roles are outdated. The wife's decision to pursue her passion and potentially a better career should be encouraged, not hindered by the husband's insecurities.\n\nAlso, the wife already made a sacrifice by putting her grad plans on hold to support them. Now she's considering another path she's excited about. The husband's opposition could be seen as undermining her autonomy and her parents' generous offer. His financial situation is stable, so there's no real necessity to prevent her from studying. \n\nIn terms of fairness, the husband's primary concern is his own ego, not any financial strain or other practical issues. The wife's happiness and career growth are important factors. The husband's stance could lead to resentment or conflict if the wife feels her aspirations are being dismissed. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the husband is in the wrong because his objections are based on personal insecurities and traditional notions of masculinity, rather than the couple's actual needs or his wife's aspirations. He should support her decision, even if it means adjusting his own feelings about being the breadwinner.\n"
