I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is about a husband not wanting his wife to pursue a career that would make her earn more than him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The husband is okay financially, supports the wife's current job, but is against her going to grad school which could make her earn more. His main issue is feeling emasculated if she makes more. They don't plan on having kids, so financial need isn't the issue. The wife's parents are offering to pay for the school, which is a financial relief.\n\nNow, looking at the dynamics. The wife previously put her grad school on hold to support the relationship, which he appreciated. Now, she's interested in pursuing it again. The husband's objection is based on his ego and financial pride. That seems self-centered. \n\nIn terms of fairness, the wife should have the right to pursue her dreams and education, especially since the financial burden isn't on the couple. His feelings about being the breadwinner might not be a valid reason to block her aspirations. The fact that he's prioritizing his own insecurities over her career goals could be seen as being in the wrong. \n\nAlso, societal norms are shifting towards valuing individual career growth in partnerships. The husband's stance might be outdated. The wife's decision to go to grad school is her choice, and the husband's resistance based on his own pride isn't a solid ethical argument. \n\nSo, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because his objection is rooted in personal insecurities rather than practical concerns for the couple's well-being. The wife's autonomy and happiness should take precedence here.\n"
