I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for not wanting their wife to pursue a career that would make her earn more than them.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the situation. The author makes enough for both of them to live comfortably. The wife is currently working but earns less. She had put her grad school plans on hold to support them financially during his master's. Now her parents are offering to pay for her grad school, which would lead to a higher salary. The author is against it because he feels it would make him feel emasculated to earn less than her, even though they don't need more money.\n\nThe key points here are about the author's motivations. He admits the main reason is his own ego\u2014feeling emasculated. That's a personal issue. The wife is motivated by her own dreams and the opportunity provided by her parents. The author's opposition isn't based on financial necessity or her well-being but on his self-esteem.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's about how his feelings impact her autonomy. The wife has a right to pursue her education and career, especially since it's her dream and the financial support from her parents makes it feasible. The author's resistance stems from insecurity, not from valid concerns about their financial stability or her happiness. \n\nAlso, the fact that they don't plan on having kids removes the traditional need for dual incomes. But that shouldn't limit her choices. Supporting each other's growth is important in a relationship. The author is hindering her potential for personal fulfillment because of his own pride.\n\nSo, even though the author's feelings are understandable, the way he's handling it is problematic. He's not considering her desires as much as his own. The answer would be that he's in the wrong because it's her right to pursue her goals, and his issue is with his own ego rather than any real financial need.\n"
