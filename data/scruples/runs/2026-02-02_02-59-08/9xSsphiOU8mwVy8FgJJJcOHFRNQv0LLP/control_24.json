I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting his wife to pursue a career that would make her earn more than him. The key points here are his reasons for opposing her decision.\n\nFirst, he mentions that he's the primary breadwinner and that he feels good about supporting them both. However, the main issue is his admission that he would feel emasculated if she made more. He also states that he's okay with her current job, which he knows she loves, but his opposition is based on his own ego and societal expectations. \n\nThe wife's parents are offering to cover all her educational expenses, which removes financial barriers. She's been considering this path before and now has the opportunity. The author's stance isn't about her career goals or their financial stability (since they live comfortably), but about his own feelings of masculinity tied to being the higher earner. \n\nIn modern relationships, supporting each other's career aspirations is often seen as important. The author's reluctance seems to stem from personal insecurities rather than any practical concerns. His feelings are valid, but they shouldn't override his wife's personal and professional goals. The fact that he's the one making more doesn't inherently make him in the wrong, but his reasoning\u2014based on emasculation rather than partnership\u2014does suggest that he's acting out of personal ego, which could be seen as selfish in the context of a supportive marriage. \n\nSo, the answer would likely be A (Yes) because his opposition is based on his own insecurities rather than objective reasons, and he's not prioritizing his wife's aspirations.\n"
