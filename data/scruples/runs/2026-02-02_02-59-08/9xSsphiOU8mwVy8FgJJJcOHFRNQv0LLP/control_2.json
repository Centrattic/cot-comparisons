I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author, a man, doesn't want his wife to pursue a graduate degree that would put her in a career making more than him. He's not opposed because of financial necessity\u2014since they don't plan to have kids and his salary is enough for them to live comfortably. The main reason he's against it is his own ego; he feels it would emasculate him to make less than her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author's opposition is based on his own feelings about being the breadwinner, not on any practical concerns like financial stability or the wife's happiness. His wife has her own job she loves but is considering a different path that she's passionate about. Her parents are offering to pay for her education, which removes the financial burden on the couple. The author's concern seems to stem from insecurity about his masculinity tied to being the higher earner.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, should a person's career choices be restricted based on a partner's ego? That's a big red flag. Each individual should have the autonomy to pursue their own goals, especially when it's not affecting the other person's well-being. The author is prioritizing his own feelings over his wife's potential happiness and aspirations. That's a classic red flag in relationships\u2014prioritizing one's own needs over the partner's growth.\n\nAlso, the author's reasoning is based on traditional gender roles where the man is the primary breadwinner. In modern relationships, financial roles are more flexible, and many couples don't adhere to this structure. The author's discomfort with making less than his wife is more about his personal insecurities rather than any objective problem. It's important to note that his stance isn't due to financial necessity but rather emotional reasons that don't involve the wife's best interests.\n\nAnother angle is communication. The author did talk to his wife about his concerns, but he didn't outright stop her. However, making his feelings about her career a barrier to her pursuing her dreams is problematic. A healthy relationship allows both partners to support each other's goals. If the author is truly against it because of his own ego, that's something he needs to address personally, not something that should dictate his wife's choices.\n\nIn terms of societal expectations, there's a growing emphasis on gender equality in relationships. The author's position might reflect outdated notions of male dominance in financial responsibility. His wife's decision to pursue her education and career is a personal choice that should be respected, especially since it's not harming the relationship's stability.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the author is in the wrong because he's prioritizing his own insecurities over his wife's aspirations, using his ego as a reason to hinder her career growth. The answer should be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
