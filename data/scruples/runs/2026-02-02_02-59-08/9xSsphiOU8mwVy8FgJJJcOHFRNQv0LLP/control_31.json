I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting his wife to pursue a career that would make her earn more than him. \n\nFirst, the author mentions that he's the main breadwinner and it makes him feel good. His wife is considering grad school funded by her parents, which would lead to a higher salary. The key issue here seems to be his emotional response based on being the breadwinner. \n\nI need to consider if his reasoning is valid. The wife is making a choice that's in her best interest, especially since they don't have kids and don't need the extra income. The author's main objection is about his own feelings of emasculation, which is a personal issue. In a healthy relationship, supporting each other's goals is important. If the wife wants to pursue her education and career, the husband should support her. His reluctance is based on ego rather than practical reasons like financial necessity or her well-being. \n\nAlso, the wife had put her grad school plans on hold earlier to support the relationship, so now she's re-evaluating. The husband's opposition might be undermining her autonomy. Even though he's honest about his feelings, the right thing would be to support her decision. So, the author is in the wrong because his objection isn't about her happiness or practical needs but his own insecurities.\n"
