I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the husband doesn't want his wife to pursue a career that would make her earn more than him. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The husband makes enough for both of them to live comfortably. His wife is considering going back to grad school, which her parents are funding, leading to a higher salary. The husband's main objection is feeling emasculated if he's not the higher earner, even though they don't need the money. They don't plan to have kids, so there's no financial necessity.\n\nThe user thinks the author is wrong, and I need to decide if that's correct. The husband's reasoning is based on his own ego, not financial need. He admits he feels emasculated, which is a personal insecurity. The wife is passionate about her dream, and her parents are supporting her education. The husband previously supported her decision to delay grad school, but now he's opposing it because of his feelings about being the breadwinner.\n\nConsidering equality in relationships, supporting each other's ambitions, and the fact that financial roles shouldn't dictate self-worth, the husband's stance seems problematic. It's about his emotional response rather than practical concerns. The wife's career choice is her own, and the husband's resistance based on ego isn't a valid reason to stop her. So, the answer should be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
