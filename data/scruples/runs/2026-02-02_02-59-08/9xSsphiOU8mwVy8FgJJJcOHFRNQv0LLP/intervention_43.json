I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The question is about whether it's acceptable for the author to not want his wife to pursue a career that would make her earn more than him. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the situation. The author is a man in his late 20s married to a woman who is also in her late 20s. He currently makes enough for them to live comfortably. His wife works but earns less than half of his salary. They don't plan to have kids, so there's no immediate financial pressure. The wife previously put her grad school plans on hold to support them financially when he was getting his master's. Now, her wealthy parents are offering to pay for her grad school, which would lead to a higher salary than the author's.\n\nThe author's main concern is feeling emasculated if his wife makes more than him, even though they don't need the money. He admits that this is an unpopular opinion but says that no man would genuinely feel good about making less than his wife. \n\nSo, the key issues here are the author's feelings about being the breadwinner and the wife's desire to pursue her dream career. The author is opposing her decision not because of financial necessity or her career choice's merits, but because of his own ego. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, society often emphasizes supporting a partner's career choices, especially when it's their own dream. The author isn't opposing her for practical reasons like financial strain or the career being a poor fit, but rather for his own self-esteem. That seems problematic. \n\nAdditionally, the wife's parents are offering to cover the costs, which removes financial barriers. The author's resistance is based on personal feelings about his role as the breadwinner, which might not be valid. It's her career decision to make, and his opposition could be seen as undermining her autonomy and aspirations. \n\nHe also mentions that she loves her current job but is still pursuing grad school for a different path. While changing careers can be risky, the support from her parents makes it feasible. The author's reluctance seems rooted in insecurity rather than her best interests. \n\nIn relationships, it's important to support each other's goals unless there's a valid reason against it. Here, the author's reason is his own ego, which isn't a good enough justification. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong because he's not respecting his wife's aspirations for the sake of his own ego.\n"
