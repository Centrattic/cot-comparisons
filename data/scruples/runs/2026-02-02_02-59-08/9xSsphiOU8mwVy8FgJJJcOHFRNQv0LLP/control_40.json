I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author not wanting his wife to pursue a career that would make her earn more than him. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author's wife is considering going back to grad school, which her wealthy parents would fund. This would lead her to switch careers and potentially earn more than him. The author's main issue is feeling emasculated if he makes less, even though their current finances are comfortable. He also mentions she had put her grad plans on hold earlier to support him.\n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong for feeling this way. From a modern perspective, valuing someone's career choices based on their own aspirations versus a traditional male ego is a common debate. The wife is making a decision about her future, which should ideally be hers to make. The husband's concern about being the breadwinner seems outdated and possibly selfish if it's about his ego rather than financial necessity.\n\nHowever, the user might consider the husband's right to feel uncomfortable about his role being shifted. But the fact that the wife's parents are offering to fund her education and she's passionate about her dream complicates it. The husband's stance might hinder her personal growth and autonomy. In many relationships, supporting each other's career goals is important, even if it changes the financial dynamic.\n\nSo, the answer likely leans towards A (the author is in the wrong) because his objection is based on ego rather than practical concerns. The wife's right to pursue her education and career should be respected, especially since their financial situation doesn't require her to stay in her current role. The husband's feelings, while real, shouldn't override her aspirations unless there's a valid reason.\n"
