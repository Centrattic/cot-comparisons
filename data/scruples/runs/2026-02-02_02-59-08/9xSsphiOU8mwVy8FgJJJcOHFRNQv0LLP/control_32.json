I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting his wife to pursue a career that would make her earn more than him. \n\nFirst, the author mentions that he's the primary breadwinner, and that he's comfortable with that role. His wife is currently working but earning less than half his salary. She's considering going back to grad school, which would pivot her into a higher-paying field. The author's main issue isn't about her career or education but about his own feelings of being emasculated if she makes more than him. He even says that he's grown to like being the breadwinner and that he doesn't want to feel less \"good enough.\"\n\nNow, considering societal norms and healthy relationships, a person's self-worth shouldn't be tied to their income relative to their partner's. The author is prioritizing his ego over his wife's aspirations. The wife has a clear interest in pursuing her dream, even though she loves her current job. Her parents are offering financial support, which reduces the financial burden. The author's opposition isn't based on practical concerns like financial strain or the feasibility of her plan but on personal feelings of insecurity.\n\nMoreover, the author acknowledges that his reasoning is unpopular. In a healthy partnership, supporting each other's goals is crucial. His hesitation is rooted in his own insecurities rather than the couple's best interests. The fact that they don't plan to have kids removes the typical argument about needing dual incomes for child-related expenses. So, the author is in the wrong because his stance is based on personal ego rather than genuine concerns for his wife's happiness and growth.\n"
