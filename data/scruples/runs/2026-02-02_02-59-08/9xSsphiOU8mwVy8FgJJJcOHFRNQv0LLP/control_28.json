I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for not wanting his wife to pursue a career that would make her earn more than him.\n\nFirst, the key points from the scenario: The author is a man in his late 20s married to a wife who currently earns less than half of his salary. They don't plan to have kids, so there's no financial necessity for her to increase her income. Her parents are offering to pay for her grad school, which would lead to a higher salary than the author's. The author is uncomfortable with the idea of her making more money than him, feeling it might make him feel emasculated.\n\nNow, considering the reasons given, the author's main issue is personal feelings about being the breadwinner. He acknowledges that this might be an unpopular opinion. The wife, on the other hand, wants to pursue her dream and is supported financially by her parents. \n\nIn terms of fairness, the author is projecting his own insecurities onto the situation. The wife's decision to pursue graduate school is her personal choice and could be beneficial for her career and personal growth. The fact that she's been supported by her parents financially removes the burden of tuition costs, making it a viable option without financial strain on the couple. \n\nThe author's opposition isn't based on logical concerns like financial instability or the wife's well-being but rather on his own ego. This is a classic case of gender-based insecurity, which can be problematic in relationships. Healthy relationships should support each other's growth, even if it means one partner becomes more successful financially. \n\nAdditionally, the wife had put her grad school plans on hold to support the author when he was in school. Now, she's considering her own path again. The author's reluctance here could undermine her autonomy and the trust built during their partnership. \n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author is indeed in the wrong. His feelings about his role as the breadwinner shouldn't override his wife's aspirations, especially when there's no financial necessity involved. The answer should be A.\n"
