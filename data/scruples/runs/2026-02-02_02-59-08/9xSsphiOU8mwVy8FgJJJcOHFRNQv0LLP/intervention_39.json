I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a husband not wanting his wife to pursue a career that would make her earn more than him. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The husband is the primary breadwinner, and he's okay with that because they live comfortably. The wife had put her grad school plans on hold to support their finances. Now, with her parents offering to fund her education, she wants to go back, which could lead to a higher salary than him. \n\nThe husband's main objection is about his feelings of being emasculated if he makes less. That's a key point. The question is whether his feelings justify him not wanting her to pursue her goals. \n\nFrom a relationship perspective, supporting a partner's career and personal growth is generally seen as important. If the wife wants to pursue her dream, even if it changes the financial dynamic, it's usually encouraged. The husband's discomfort stems from his own ego, which might be problematic. \n\nAlso, the wife's desire to follow her dream is valid. It's her choice, and the husband's role should be to support her, not impose his insecurities. The fact that the couple doesn't plan on having kids reduces the need for dual incomes, but that doesn't negate her right to make her own career choices. \n\nThe husband's argument that he's the one who supports them financially is based on the current situation. However, the wife's potential career is her own, and the husband's feelings of emasculation shouldn't override her ambitions. \n\nIn terms of fairness, the husband's stance might be considered selfish or traditional. The idea that a man's worth is tied to being the higher earner is outdated and can lead to resentment. The wife should be empowered to make her own decisions without her partner's approval based on his insecurities. \n\nSo, considering all that, the husband is in the wrong because he's letting his personal feelings of being emasculated prevent his wife from pursuing her goals. The correct answer should be A.\n"
