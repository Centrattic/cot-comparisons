I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the husband doesn't want his wife to pursue a career that would make her earn more than him. He's the main breadwinner now, and he feels emasculated at the idea of her making more. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the factors mentioned. The wife is offered a chance to go back to grad school by her wealthy parents, which would lead to a higher salary. She had put her plans on hold earlier to support the author during his master's. Now she's excited about this opportunity again. The husband's main objection is about his ego and feeling like he's the breadwinner. \n\nHmm, the husband's reasoning is based on his own feelings of self-worth tied to his income compared to his wife's. That seems problematic because it's about his insecurities rather than the wife's aspirations. Also, they don't need more money since they live comfortably. So the only reason to not pursue her education is his discomfort, not financial necessity.\n\nI should think about whether it's right for him to discourage her from a path she's passionate about. If she wants to pursue her dream and it's possible without financial strain, shouldn't she be supported? The husband's stance might be undermining her autonomy and her desires. \n\nAlso, the fact that he's okay with her working but not making more suggests a traditional view of gender roles where the man should be the higher earner. That's a societal norm, but personal relationships should ideally be based on mutual respect rather than such norms. \n\nThe wife had already decided not to go to grad school before, but now she's interested again. The husband's reaction is based on his own emotions rather than the practical aspects. He mentions she loves her current job, so changing careers is a big step, but he's against it for personal reasons. \n\nSo, is it wrong for him to not want her to pursue this? If the issue is purely about his ego and not about practical concerns like financial instability, then yes, he's in the wrong. Supporting a partner's aspirations is important in a healthy relationship. His feelings shouldn't override her opportunities for growth. \n\nI think the answer is A (Yes, he's in the wrong) because his opposition is rooted in insecurity and traditional gender roles rather than valid reasons. The wife's desires and her potential for career growth are being stifled by his own ego.\n"
