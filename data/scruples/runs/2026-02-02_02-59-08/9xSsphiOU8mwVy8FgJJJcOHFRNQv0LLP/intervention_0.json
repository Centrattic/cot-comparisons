I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The scenario involves a husband not wanting his wife to pursue a career that could make her earn more than him.\n\nFirst, the key points: The husband is the primary breadwinner, and they live comfortably on his salary alone. The wife, who previously put her grad school plans on hold, now has the chance to go back with her parents' financial support. The husband's main reason is feeling emasculated if he makes less. He also mentions that she loves her current job, but he's worried about a different career path. \n\nNow, considering the dynamics. The husband's concern is based on his own feelings of ego and societal norms about being the breadwinner. But in modern relationships, equality and mutual support are often emphasized. The wife is pursuing her own dream and has the financial backing from her family. The husband's reluctance seems to stem from personal insecurities rather than practical concerns. \n\nHe also mentions that there's no need for more income since they don't plan to have kids. So, the issue isn't about financial necessity but about his self-worth tied to income. That's a red flag. Healthier relationships prioritize each other's growth and happiness over maintaining traditional roles. The husband isn't supporting his wife's aspirations for her own fulfillment, which is a key aspect of a supportive partnership.\n\nAnother angle: The wife already made a sacrifice earlier by putting her grad school on hold to support them. Now, she's considering another path. The husband's reaction might be dismissive of her current job satisfaction and her desire for a different career. He didn't address her reasons properly; he focused on his feelings instead of hers.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the husband is in the wrong because his decision is based on his ego rather than her personal growth. The wife deserves to pursue her goals without his resistance. The husband should reflect on why he feels threatened and work on his self-esteem, perhaps seeking to support her aspirations instead of hindering them.\n"
