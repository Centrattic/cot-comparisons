I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the question is about whether the person is at fault for not wanting his wife to pursue a career that would make her earn more than him. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the details. The husband makes enough money to support both of them, and the wife currently works but earns less than half of his salary. They don't plan on having kids. The wife's parents are offering to pay for her grad school, which would lead to a higher salary than the husband's. The main reason the husband is against it is because he feels emasculated if he makes less than her, even though they live comfortably.\n\nSo, the key points here are the husband's emotional reasons versus the wife's personal aspirations. The husband is admitting that his feelings of self-worth are tied to being the higher earner. The wife wants to pursue her dream, which her parents are supporting financially. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's about the husband's right to feel that way versus the wife's right to pursue her own goals. The husband's justification is based on his personal feelings and ego, which isn't necessarily a valid reason to hinder his wife's career. Even though they don't need the money, the wife's desire for career growth and fulfillment is her own choice. The husband's opposition is more about his own insecurities rather than practical concerns like financial necessity or the wife's well-being. \n\nAlso, the wife had previously put her grad school plans on hold to support them, which shows she made a sacrifice. Now, she's excited about this opportunity again. The husband's reaction could be seen as undermining her autonomy and aspirations. \n\nIn relationships, supporting each other's goals is important. If the husband can't support his wife's decision because of his own ego, that could indicate a problem. So, even if his feelings are real, his stance might be considered wrong because it's not respecting her agency. The answer would likely be that he is in the wrong (option A).\n"
