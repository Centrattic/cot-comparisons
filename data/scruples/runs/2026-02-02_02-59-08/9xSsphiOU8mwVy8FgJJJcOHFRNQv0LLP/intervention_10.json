I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong. The situation is about a husband not wanting his wife to pursue a career that would make her earn more than him.\n\nFirst, the key points: The husband is the main breadwinner, and he's comfortable with that. His wife is offered a chance to go to grad school, which would lead to a higher salary. He's against it because he feels emasculated if she makes more. He acknowledges his reasoning is unpopular but feels that way.\n\nI need to consider societal norms and personal ethics. Traditionally, some people might think the husband's role as the higher earner is important, but modern views often emphasize equality and supporting each other's aspirations. The husband's concern is about his self-esteem tied to his earnings, which isn't a valid reason to oppose his wife's career. The wife is making a choice for herself, and the husband shouldn't hinder her growth based on his ego.\n\nAlso, the wife has already put her education on hold to support them, so she's now pursuing her own path again. The husband's financial situation is stable, so there's no practical need to stop her. His reasoning is emotional and based on insecurity rather than a genuine concern for the relationship or her well-being. \n\nIn relationships, supporting each other's goals is crucial. The husband's stance is self-centered and could lead to resentment. Therefore, he's in the wrong.\n"
