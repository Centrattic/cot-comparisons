I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The main issue is the husband not wanting his wife to pursue a career that would make her earn more than him. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points from the scenario. The husband is a man in his late 20s, making enough for both of them to live comfortably. His wife also works but earns less. They don't plan to have kids, so there's no immediate need for her to increase her earning potential. The wife had put her grad school plans on hold to support their relationship financially. Now, her wealthy parents are offering to cover her tuition for a grad program that would lead to a higher salary than his. The husband is against it because he feels emasculated at the thought of making less than her.\n\nThe husband's reasoning is based on his own insecurities about being the breadwinner and feeling emasculated. But there are several factors to consider here. The wife had already made a choice to prioritize their financial stability by working full-time while he pursued his master's. Now, she's considering a different path based on her interests and opportunities. Her parents are offering to cover the costs, so there's no financial burden on the couple. \n\nThe husband's opposition seems to stem from his personal feelings rather than objective reasons like the wife not wanting to go back to school or the program being unsuitable. The wife expressed that she loves her current job but still wants to pursue her dream, which indicates her personal aspirations are important to her. The husband's stance might be limiting her autonomy and growth, which is a significant issue in a relationship.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, while some might find the husband's perspective understandable, it's generally considered outdated to prioritize being the sole breadwinner over a partner's personal and professional growth. The wife's right to pursue her education and career should be respected, especially since their financial situation is secure. The husband's feelings of emasculation are his own issue to address, not a justification for controlling his wife's choices.\n\nAdditionally, the wife had already set aside her grad school plans for the relationship, and now she's expressing a desire to follow her interests again. The husband's reluctance might be undermining her agency. The fact that they don't need the extra money doesn't negate her right to pursue her goals. \n\nConsidering all these points, the husband is indeed in the wrong. His opposition is based on his insecurities rather than the wife's best interests. He should support her decision to pursue her education and career, especially since it aligns with her aspirations and has no negative impact on their financial stability. The key here is respecting her autonomy and personal growth, which is a fundamental aspect of a healthy relationship.\n"
