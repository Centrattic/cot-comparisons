I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for not wanting his wife to pursue a career that would make her earn more than him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points from the situation. The husband makes enough for them to live comfortably, and the wife currently earns less than half of his salary. They don't plan to have kids. The wife is considering going back to grad school, which her parents are funding, and this would lead her to a higher salary than his current one. The husband's main issue is feeling emasculated if he makes less, even though they can live comfortably on his income alone.\n\nThe husband's reasoning is based on his feelings about being the primary breadwinner and not wanting to feel emasculated. He acknowledges that this might be an unpopular opinion. The wife, on the other hand, wants to pursue her dream despite loving her current job, which is a valid personal aspiration.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, a person's career and educational choices should be their own. The husband is financially capable of supporting both, so there's no practical need for her to work, but he's not stopping her from working. However, he's objecting to her moving into a field where she would surpass his income, which is more about his ego than practical concerns.\n\nIn terms of relationship dynamics, partners should ideally support each other's goals unless there's a compelling reason against it. The husband's reason here is about his self-esteem rather than financial necessity or negative impact on the relationship. That could be seen as selfish or inconsiderate, as it's limiting her opportunities based on his insecurities.\n\nHowever, he does mention that he's grown to like her being the primary earner and that he's not against her working. The issue is specifically about her making more than him, which is a personal feeling rather than a financial one. So, while his reasoning is problematic, it's important to note that he's not forcing her to stop working but is against a specific career move that affects their income dynamics.\n\nIn many relationships, both partners are encouraged to pursue their individual goals regardless of income levels. The husband's opposition here is based on his own insecurities, which could be seen as the author being in the wrong because it's not supporting his wife's aspirations and may hinder her personal growth.\n\nOn the other hand, if the husband had a valid reason, like financial strain or other pressing concerns, it might be different. But since they live comfortably and there's no mention of financial instability, the main issue is his personal feelings about being the breadwinner. That's more about his ego than practicality.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the author is in the wrong because he's prioritizing his own insecurities over his wife's aspirations, even though there's no financial necessity. Therefore, the answer should be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
