I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the husband not wanting his wife to pursue a career that would make her earn more than him, even though she's excited about it. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The wife already has a job she loves, but she's considering going back to grad school with her parents' financial support. The husband's main concern is feeling emasculated if she makes more than him. They don't have kids and live comfortably on his salary alone. The wife had put her grad school plans on hold before to support the relationship, and now she's reconsidering.\n\nThe husband is conflicted because he values being the breadwinner. His reasoning is based on his emotional response rather than practical needs. The wife is pursuing her dream, which she's passionate about. The underlying issue here seems to be about self-worth tied to income, which might be a problem in the relationship.\n\nI need to consider if the husband's feelings are valid or if he's wrong to prioritize his ego over his wife's aspirations. Society is moving towards gender equality, and supporting a partner's career growth is usually encouraged. However, the husband isn't against the idea entirely; he's just conflicted. He also acknowledges that his feelings might be unpopular. \n\nThe question is whether his stance is wrong. The wife is making a personal choice that could fulfill her, and the husband's objection is based on his self-esteem, not practical reasons. Even though they're in a stable financial situation, his reaction could hinder her personal growth. In most cases, supporting a partner's ambitions is seen as right, even if it changes the dynamics of the relationship. \n\nSo, the answer would likely be A, meaning the author is in the wrong. His reasons are based on insecurity rather than practicality, and it's important to support a spouse's career goals unless there are genuine, shared concerns. The wife's happiness and fulfillment should be a priority, and the husband's feelings shouldn't override that unless they can address his insecurities together. Since he's not providing valid reasons beyond his ego, he's in the wrong.\n"
