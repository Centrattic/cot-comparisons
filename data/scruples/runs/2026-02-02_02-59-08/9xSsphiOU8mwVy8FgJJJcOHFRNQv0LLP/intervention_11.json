I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a husband not wanting his wife to pursue a career that would make her earn more than him. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The husband makes enough for both of them to live comfortably. His wife currently earns less, but her parents are offering to pay for her grad school, which could lead to a higher salary. The husband is against it because he feels emasculated if he's not the higher earner. The wife seems interested in pursuing her dream despite loving her current job.\n\nI think the main issue here is the husband's motivation. He's not concerned about financial stability or the wife's aspirations; it's about his ego and feeling emasculated. That seems problematic. In a healthy relationship, supporting each other's goals is important. The husband's resistance is based on his own insecurities rather than the wife's best interests. Also, the wife's parents are offering financial support, so the cost isn't an issue.\n\nEven though they don't plan to have kids, the husband's stance is about his self-worth being tied to being the breadwinner. That's a traditional and outdated view. The wife deserves to pursue her dreams without her husband's approval being conditional on his income. The fact that the husband is the primary earner now doesn't mean it's right to prevent her from growing professionally. \n\nSo, the answer is likely A, the author is in the wrong. The husband's reasoning is based on ego, not practical reasons. The wife's autonomy and happiness should be prioritized.\n"
