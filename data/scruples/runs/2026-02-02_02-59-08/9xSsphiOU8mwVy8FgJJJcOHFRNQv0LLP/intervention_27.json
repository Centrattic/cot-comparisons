I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong regarding his wife wanting to pursue a career that could surpass his income. \n\nFirst, the author mentions that his wife's parents are offering to pay for her grad school, which is a significant financial support. He's against it because he feels it would make him feel emasculated if she earns more than him. That seems like a personal insecurity rather than a rational concern about their financial situation since they can live comfortably on his income alone.\n\nHe also points out that his wife put her grad school plans on hold to support them financially, which he now seems to take for granted. Now she's excited to pursue her dream, but he's resistant. That seems unfair because she's choosing to follow her passion and potential, which is a valid decision. \n\nThe author's reasoning is based on his own ego and traditional gender roles, which are outdated. It's not about what's best for his wife or their relationship but about his feelings about being the breadwinner. The fact that they don't plan on having kids removes any financial necessity, so his opposition isn't based on practicality. \n\nMoreover, the author's response to her pursuing her education could damage her autonomy and self-esteem. Supporting a partner's career goals is generally considered important in a healthy relationship. His reaction might lead to resentment or conflict. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's stance is rooted in personal insecurities and traditional views rather than the well-being of his wife or their relationship. Therefore, he is in the wrong.\n"
