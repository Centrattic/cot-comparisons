I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting his wife to pursue a career that would make her earn more than him. \n\nFirst, the author's wife has a well-paying job and he's the main breadwinner. She's now considering grad school with her parents' funding, which would lead her to a higher salary. The author is uncomfortable with the idea of her making more than him, even though they don't need the extra money.\n\nThe key points here are about personal feelings versus practicality. He admits he likes being the breadwinner and feels emasculated if he makes less. But he also acknowledges that his wife loves her current job and has a dream she wants to pursue. The wife is being supported by her parents, so there's no financial burden on them. \n\nThe author's main issue seems to stem from insecurity and traditional gender roles. He's prioritizing his own ego over his wife's aspirations. Even though he says he backs off, the wife might still feel his disapproval. \n\nIn a healthy relationship, supporting each other's goals is important. The author is using the excuse of financial comfort, but the real issue is his own insecurities. He's not considering his wife's happiness and dreams. So, yes, he's in the wrong. The answer should be A.\n"
