I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author not wanting his wife to pursue a career that would make her earn more than him. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author and his wife are in their late 20s. He makes enough for them to live comfortably, she works but earns less than half his salary. They don't plan to have kids. Her parents offered to pay for her grad school, which would lead her to a higher salary. The author opposes this because he feels it would make him feel emasculated if she made more.\n\nThe core issue here is about the author's personal feelings of self-worth being tied to being the higher earner. He admits that the main reason is his discomfort with being the lower earner, despite their financial stability. He acknowledges that it's an unpopular opinion but feels that way. \n\nNow, considering societal norms, in many relationships, both partners are encouraged to pursue their individual goals regardless of income. However, there's also the aspect of the author's feelings. The wife initially put her studies on hold to support them, and now she's considering a new path. The author's opposition is based on his own emotional response rather than objective reasons like financial necessity or the wife's well-being.\n\nThe question is whether his stance is wrong. If the wife is happy in her current job and considering moving to another field that she's passionate about, then the author's resistance based solely on his own ego might be problematic. Healthy relationships typically require supporting each other's ambitions. The author's feelings are valid, but using them to discourage his wife from pursuing her goals could be seen as selfish or controlling.\n\nAlso, the fact that they don't need the extra money doesn't negate her right to pursue her dreams. The author's insecurity about being the breadwinner is his personal issue, not a reason to prevent her from advancing. It's important to consider whether his opposition is about their financial stability (which it's not) or his own self-esteem (which it is). \n\nSo, in terms of right or wrong, while his feelings are understandable, acting on them to stop his wife from making a choice about her career is likely inconsiderate of her autonomy and their partnership's equality. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong.\n"
