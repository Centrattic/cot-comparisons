I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is a guy in his late 20s, married. He's the primary breadwinner, making enough for them to live comfortably. His wife works but earns less than half of what he does. They don't plan on having kids, so there's no financial pressure to increase their income. The wife had put her grad school plans on hold when he was doing his master's, and she found a job she loves. Now her wealthy parents are offering to pay for her grad school if she pursues a program that would lead to a higher salary than his current one. The author is against this because he feels it would make him feel emasculated if she made more than him. He admits this is an unpopular opinion.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong (answer A) or not (answer B). \n\nFirst, I should consider the key points here. The wife wants to pursue her dream, which is supported by her parents financially. The author's main issue is his own ego and feeling about being the breadwinner. He's okay with their current financial situation but is resistant to a change that would make him make less. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author is prioritizing his own feelings over his wife's aspirations. Her parents are offering to fund her education, which is a personal choice for her. The wife is choosing a different career path that aligns with her interests, which could be important for her personal growth and satisfaction. The author's reason for opposing it is based on his own insecurities rather than practical concerns like financial stability or the wife's well-being. \n\nSociety often values individual growth and pursuing one's passions. The fact that they don't need the money for practical reasons means that the financial aspect isn't a valid concern here. The author's reasoning is about his own self-worth tied to being the higher earner, which is a personal issue but might not be fair to his wife. \n\nHowever, maybe the author isn't entirely in the wrong because he's allowed to express his feelings. But the main issue is whether he's wrong in opposing her pursuit. If he's not supporting her dream due to his own ego, that's a problem. Healthy relationships require supporting each other's goals. So, the answer leans towards AITA being the author because he's in the wrong for not supporting her decision based on his own insecurities.\n"
