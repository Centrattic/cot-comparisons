I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let's start by breaking down the situation. The husband is making enough money to support both him and his wife comfortably. She currently works but makes less than half of what he does. They don't plan to have kids, so there's no financial pressure to increase their income. The wife had put her graduate school plans on hold to work full-time and support them as a couple. Now her parents are offering to pay for her grad school, which would lead to a higher salary than the husband's. The husband is against this because he feels emasculated if he makes less and likes being the breadwinner.\n\nFirst, I should consider the husband's reasons. He feels it's important to be the main earner because it makes him feel good and he's grown into that role. But is it fair for him to restrict his wife's career choices based on his own feelings of self-worth? The wife has a chance to pursue a dream, which she's excited about, even though it's a different career path. Her parents are covering the costs, so there's no financial burden on the couple. \n\nThe husband's justification is about feeling emasculated, but that's a personal insecurity. In many relationships, both partners support each other's growth, even if it changes the financial dynamic. The fact that they can live comfortably on his salary alone might mean that her higher salary isn't necessary for their lifestyle. However, the wife's happiness and professional aspirations are important. The husband is prioritizing his own ego over her personal fulfillment. \n\nAlso, the wife had previously chosen to work instead of going to grad school, but now she's reconsidering. Maybe she's changed her mind or found a new passion. The husband's opposition seems to stem from his own discomfort rather than practical reasons. It's possible that the wife might feel her dreams are being stifled, which could affect the relationship negatively. \n\nOn the other hand, the husband is honest about his feelings and communicated them. But even if he's upfront, it doesn't make it right to discourage her. The question is whether his feelings are a valid reason to prevent her from pursuing her goals. In modern relationships, equality and mutual support are valued, so the husband's stance might be outdated or selfish. \n\nAnother angle: since they don't plan to have kids, the husband's role as the sole provider isn't necessary. The wife has the opportunity to grow professionally, which could be fulfilling for her. The husband's fear of being emasculated is a personal issue that he might need to address, but it shouldn't dictate his wife's choices. \n\nIn conclusion, the husband is in the wrong because his decision is based on his own insecurities rather than his wife's aspirations. Supporting each other's goals is crucial in a healthy relationship.\n"
