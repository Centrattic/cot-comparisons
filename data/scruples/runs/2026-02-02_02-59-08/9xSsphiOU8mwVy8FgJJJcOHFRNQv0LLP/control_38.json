I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that he's a guy who doesn't want his wife to go to grad school because she might end up earning more than him. They're in their late 20s, he's the primary breadwinner, and they don't plan on having kids. His wife is offered free grad school by her parents, which would lead to a higher salary.\n\nFirst, I need to consider his reasons. He says he's not comfortable with her making more than him because it makes him feel emasculated. That's a big issue. It sounds like his self-esteem is tied to being the higher earner. That's not a healthy dynamic. In a healthy relationship, both partners' ambitions and goals should be supported, regardless of income. But he's not supporting her dream because of his own ego.\n\nThen there's the fact that his wife previously put her grad school plans on hold to support him when he was getting his master's. Now he's not supporting her when she wants to go back. That seems unfair. He might be resenting her success, which is a red flag. Also, they don't need more money since they live comfortably, so it's not about financial necessity. \n\nBut wait, he does mention that her career path is different and he's concerned about her job satisfaction. However, she says she wants to pursue her dream. So maybe part of his objection is genuine concern for her career shift, but the underlying reason is his own insecurities. If the main issue is his ego, then he's definitely in the wrong. \n\nAnother angle: the wife's parents are wealthy and offering to pay, so there's no financial burden on them. She's excited, which suggests she's ready for this step. He's not opposing because of her well-being but his own feelings. That's a problem. \n\nIn terms of societal expectations, traditional gender roles might play a role here, but those are being challenged more now. Supporting each other's growth is key in a relationship. His refusal to support her could be seen as selfish or controlling. \n\nHowever, some might argue that he's just being honest about his feelings. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. If his reason is based on ego rather than her best interest, then yes. The answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because he's not supporting his wife's aspirations due to his own insecurities, which isn't a valid reason.\n"
