I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting their wife to pursue a career that would make her earn more than them. The author acknowledges that their reasoning is tied to feeling emasculated if their wife earns more, despite being able to support the household comfortably.\n\nFirst, I need to consider societal norms and expectations. Traditionally, there's been an expectation of the male partner being the primary earner, but that's changing. Modern relationships often emphasize equality and mutual support regardless of income. The author's hesitation seems rooted in personal insecurity rather than the couple's actual financial needs, which they state are already met.\n\nThe wife's decision to pursue further education is her personal choice and could lead to her personal fulfillment. The author's opposition based on ego might undermine her autonomy. Even though the author's feelings are valid, they shouldn't override the wife's aspirations unless there's a compelling reason related to the relationship's well-being. Since there are no kids and financial stability isn't an issue, the author's concern seems more about self-esteem than practicality.\n\nIn healthy relationships, supporting each other's goals is crucial. The author's reluctance might lead to resentment or hinder the wife's growth. It's possible the author isn't truly against her success but is struggling with their own insecurities. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the decision to pursue higher education is the wife's right and the author's objection is based on personal feelings rather than shared values or practical needs, the answer would lean towards the author being in the wrong.\n"
