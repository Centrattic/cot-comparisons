I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting his wife to pursue a career that would make her earn more than him. The situation is complex, so I need to consider multiple angles.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that he's the primary breadwinner, and his wife's job is a full-time position she loves. She's been working while he pursued his master's. Now, her parents are offering to fund her grad school, which could lead to a higher salary. The author is concerned about feeling emasculated if she makes more than him, even though they don't need the extra money.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, the wife's decision to pursue her education and career should be her own choice. The author's main objection isn't based on practical concerns like financial necessity but on his own ego. That's a red flag. Respecting a partner's autonomy and supporting their aspirations is crucial in a healthy relationship. The author's feelings of being emasculated seem rooted in traditional gender roles, which can be problematic. It's important to recognize that a person's worth isn't tied to their income relative to their partner's.\n\nHowever, the author does mention that he and his wife don't plan to have kids, so the need for higher earnings isn't about family expenses. That might make the situation seem less urgent, but it doesn't justify the author's resistance. The key issue is whether the author is supporting his wife's goals. If he's discouraging her because of his own insecurities, that's a problem. The wife already put her education on hold to support him, so now she's trying to fulfill her own dreams. The author should ideally support that, even if it makes him uncomfortable.\n\nAlso, the author's reasoning about feeling emasculated is a personal issue that shouldn't override his wife's career aspirations. It's about mutual respect and partnership. If the author can't let go of that insecurity, it might affect their relationship dynamics. The fact that they are in their late 20s but not considering kids means they have time to navigate this, but the author's stance could hinder his wife's growth.\n\nIn conclusion, the author is in the wrong because his objections are based on his own ego and not on legitimate concerns for his wife's well-being or the couple's financial stability. Supporting a partner's career decisions is a fundamental aspect of a healthy relationship. The answer should be A.\n"
