I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting his wife to pursue a career that could make her earn more than him. \n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The man is in his late 20s with a wife who also works but makes less than half of his salary. They don't plan to have kids, so there's no immediate financial need. The wife put her graduate studies on hold to support the couple financially during his master's. Now her parents are offering to pay for her grad school, which could lead to a higher salary than his current job. The husband is against it because he feels it would make him feel emasculated to be the lower earner, even though they live comfortably.\n\nThe key points here are the husband's emotional reasons versus the wife's aspirations. The husband is prioritizing his own ego over his wife's goals. Even though there's no financial necessity, the wife wants to pursue her dream. The husband's stance is based on his self-esteem tied to being the breadwinner, which is a traditional gender role. However, in modern relationships, mutual support for each other's careers is often encouraged. The husband's reluctance could be seen as undermining his wife's ambitions for his own sake, which is problematic. \n\nThe wife's parents' motivation might be part of the issue, but that's separate from the husband's responsibility to support her. The husband's primary issue is prioritizing his feelings over his wife's career goals. The fact that they can afford her education without financial strain means there's no real barrier except his own discomfort. This could lead to resentment in the wife and an imbalance in the relationship dynamics. \n\nSo, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because he's not supporting his wife's aspirations for selfish reasons. Healthy relationships require mutual support, and his stance could harm their partnership by not valuing her ambitions equally.\n"
