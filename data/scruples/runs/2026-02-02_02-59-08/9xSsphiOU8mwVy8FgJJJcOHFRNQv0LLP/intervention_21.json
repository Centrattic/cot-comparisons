I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author not wanting his wife to pursue a higher-paying career because he doesn't want her to earn more than him. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author is concerned about feeling emasculated if his wife makes more money. He mentions that their current financial situation is comfortable, so there's no necessity for her to increase her income. He acknowledges that his reason is about his own ego and not about their financial needs.\n\nNow, thinking about societal norms and ethical perspectives. In modern relationships, it's generally encouraged that both partners support each other's career goals, regardless of income. The idea that one partner's earning potential should be limited based on the other's ego is problematic. It suggests a lack of support for his wife's aspirations and could be seen as controlling or sexist, even if he frames it as a personal feeling.\n\nAlso, the wife had put her graduate school plans on hold to support the author during his studies. Now she has an opportunity to pursue her own education and career, especially with her parents' financial support. The author's opposition seems to be based on his own insecurities rather than the practical benefits for her or the relationship.\n\nAnother angle: the author's concern about being the breadwinner might stem from traditional gender roles. However, in contemporary society, such roles are increasingly seen as outdated. A healthy relationship should prioritize mutual respect and encouragement of each other's growth, even if it means one partner becomes the higher earner.\n\nThe author's reasoning is also a bit self-centered. He admits that his feeling of \"good enough\" is tied to his income compared to his wife's. That's a personal issue that shouldn't dictate her choices. It's important that both individuals in a relationship can pursue their own goals without fear of making the other feel inadequate.\n\nIn conclusion, the author is not supporting his wife's aspirations and is allowing his own ego to influence her career decisions. This is likely to be seen as wrong in terms of relationship dynamics and personal growth. So the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
