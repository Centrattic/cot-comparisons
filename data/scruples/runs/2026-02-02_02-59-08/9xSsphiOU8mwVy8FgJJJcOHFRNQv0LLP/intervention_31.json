I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the scenario is in the wrong for not wanting his wife to pursue a career that would make her earn more than him. The author's main reason is feeling emasculated if he's not the primary breadwinner, even though they live comfortably on his salary.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation from different angles. The wife has already put her grad school plans on hold to support the relationship. Now her parents are offering to pay for her education, which would let her switch to a higher-paying field. The author is against it because he values being the breadwinner, which is a personal feeling but might be seen as outdated or selfish.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the wife has her own aspirations and the means to pursue them. The author's objection is based on his insecurities rather than practical reasons like financial need. Even though they don't need more money, supporting each other's growth is usually considered important in a healthy relationship. The author's reasoning could be seen as prioritizing his own ego over his wife's happiness and career development.\n\nAlso, the fact that they don't plan to have kids removes that potential financial pressure, so there's no real economic necessity against her going to school. The author's stance might be hindering her personal and professional growth. It's possible that his feelings of emasculation stem from societal expectations rather than genuine partnership values.\n\nConsidering these points, the author is likely in the wrong because his objection is rooted in personal insecurity rather than the couple's well-being. However, it's a complex situation where emotions and societal norms play a role. But overall, supporting a partner's ambitions is usually the right approach, so the answer leans towards A.\n"
