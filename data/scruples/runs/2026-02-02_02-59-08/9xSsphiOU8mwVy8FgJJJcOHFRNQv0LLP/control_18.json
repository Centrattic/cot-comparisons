I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking whether the author (the husband) is in the wrong for not wanting his wife to pursue a career that would make her earn more than him. \n\nFirst, the husband's main reason is feeling emasculated if he's not the breadwinner. He mentions that they live comfortably on his salary alone, and they don't plan to have kids. His wife previously put her grad school plans on hold to support them, but now her parents are offering to fund her education again. The wife wants to follow her passion, even though it's a different career path.\n\nThe husband's argument is based on his emotional response and societal expectations about being the primary earner. But there are several points to consider here. The wife is making a personal choice about her education and career, which are important aspects of her life. The husband's opposition seems rooted in his own feelings of self-worth tied to his income, which might not be fair to her. \n\nFinancially, they can afford for her to pursue this without strain, so it's not about necessity. The fact that the wife wants to follow her dream despite the husband's concerns suggests that her autonomy is a key factor here. It's possible that the husband's feelings are valid, but the way he's expressing them might be dismissive of his wife's aspirations. \n\nAlso, the husband's reasoning about feeling \"good enough\" if he makes less could be a traditional view that doesn't account for equality in the relationship. Healthy relationships often prioritize mutual support and individual growth. If the husband's main objection is about his ego, that could be problematic. \n\nSo, the husband is in the wrong because he's prioritizing his own insecurities over his wife's personal and professional goals, especially when there's no financial pressure. The wife's right to pursue her education and career should be respected, regardless of income comparison.\n"
