I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the husband not wanting his wife to pursue a career that would make her earn more than him. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The husband is the primary earner, and they live comfortably. The wife put her grad school plans on hold to support them, and now she's considering going back because her parents are offering to pay. She loves her current job but wants to pursue a different path. The husband's main issue is feeling emasculated if she earns more than him, even though they don't need the money.\n\nThe question is whether the husband is in the wrong. The user thinks he is. I need to consider societal norms, personal feelings, and the dynamics of relationships. \n\nThe husband's reasoning is based on his own ego and the idea of being the breadwinner. That's a traditional view that might be outdated. In modern relationships, both partners' careers are often considered equally important, regardless of income. The fact that they don't need the money doesn't negate her right to pursue her goals. \n\nHe also mentions that she previously put grad school on hold, so maybe this is a conflict between past decisions and current aspirations. Supporting a partner's ambitions is usually seen as important. His feeling of emasculation is personal, but it shouldn't override her desires, especially since there's no financial necessity.\n\nHowever, he did express concerns about the career path being different and her current job satisfaction. But she says she wants to pursue her dream. The husband's main issue is his own self-esteem, which shouldn't be the basis for his partner's choices.\n\nIn terms of fairness, respecting each other's goals is crucial. Even if he's uncomfortable, he should support her if she's happy and it's what she wants. Financially, they can still live comfortably, so it's not a matter of survival. The husband's feelings, while valid, don't justify preventing her from pursuing her education and career.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be that the husband is in the wrong (A). He's prioritizing his ego over her aspirations and their relationship should be based on mutual support regardless of income.\n"
