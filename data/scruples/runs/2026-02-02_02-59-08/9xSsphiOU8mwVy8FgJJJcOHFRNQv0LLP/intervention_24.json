I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a husband who doesn't want his wife to pursue a career that would make her earn more than him. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The husband is making enough for them to live comfortably, and they don't plan to have kids. The wife previously put her grad school plans on hold to support them financially. Now her parents are offering to pay for her grad school, which would lead to a higher salary. The husband's main issue is feeling emasculated if she makes more than him.\n\nHmm, so the main conflict here is about the husband's feelings of masculinity tied to being the breadwinner. That's a bit traditional and might not align with modern views where both partners' careers are valued equally. The wife is pursuing her own dream, which seems important for her personal growth and happiness. \n\nThe husband's reasoning is based on his own insecurities rather than practical needs, like financial necessity. Since they don't need the extra money, his opposition seems to stem from ego. Also, the wife had already postponed her education before, and now she's excited to pursue it. The husband's reluctance could be seen as stifling her aspirations. \n\nIn a healthy relationship, supporting each other's goals is crucial. The husband's feelings are valid, but they shouldn't override his wife's career ambitions. It's about mutual respect and understanding. The fact that the wife's parents are offering financial support also means there's no added financial burden on the couple, so the husband's concern is more about emotional reasons.\n\nSo, the answer would be that the husband is in the wrong because his objection is based on personal insecurities rather than objective reasons related to their financial stability. He should support his wife's decision to pursue her dream, even if it means she earns more than him. The answer is A.\n"
