I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about the author not wanting his wife to pursue a career that would make her earn more than him.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author's main issue is feeling emasculated if his wife makes more. He mentions feeling good about being the breadwinner and that he supports them financially. The wife's parents are offering to pay for her grad school, which is in a field that could lead to a higher salary. The wife loves her current job but wants to pursue a different path she's passionate about.\n\nThe author acknowledges that his reasoning is not popular, but he's honest about his feelings. However, the question is whether he's wrong. From a traditional standpoint, some might think it's okay for a partner to want to be the primary earner. But in modern relationships, supporting a partner's career growth is often encouraged, regardless of income levels.\n\nThe author's concern isn't about financial necessity; they live comfortably on his salary. The wife isn't planning to have kids, so there's no immediate need for her to increase her earning potential. The author's main issue is emotional\u2014his self-esteem tied to his income relative to his wife's. That seems to be a personal insecurity rather than a practical concern.\n\nAlso, the wife previously put her grad school on hold to support the relationship, which the author is happy with. Now she's revisiting her dreams, which the author is discouraging. The author's stance might be seen as limiting her personal growth and aspirations. The husband's feelings of emasculation are based on societal norms rather than the actual situation where financial stability isn't compromised.\n\nIn healthy relationships, partners support each other's goals. The husband's opposition seems to stem from his own insecurities rather than the wife's best interest. Even if the husband feels uncomfortable, it's important to prioritize the wife's happiness and career if it's what she truly wants.\n\nTherefore, the author is in the wrong because his reasons for opposing his wife's career path are based on his own emotional needs rather than objective reasons related to their financial security or her well-being. He should support her decision if she's passionate about it, even if it leads to her earning more.\n"
