I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully. \n\nThe author is a guy in his late 20s who is married. He makes enough money for both of them to live comfortably. His wife works but earns less than half of what he does. They don't plan on having kids, so there's no financial pressure to increase their income. When he was getting his master's, his wife put her grad school plans on hold to support them financially. She found a job she loved and didn't mention grad school again until her parents offered to pay for it. Now, she wants to go back to school to pursue a different career path that would make her earn more than him. The author is against it because he likes being the breadwinner and would feel emasculated if she made more. \n\nThe key points here are his reasons for not wanting her to pursue this. He admits that his main issue is feeling emasculated if he makes less. He also mentions that they don't need more money. His wife, on the other hand, wants to follow her dream, even though it's a different career path. She had previously put her education on hold to support him and now has the opportunity to go back due to her parents' financial support. \n\nSo, is he wrong? Well, his reasoning seems to be based on his own ego rather than her aspirations or their actual financial needs. He's okay with her working but doesn't want her to earn more than him. That seems like a traditional gender role expectation, which might be outdated. Also, since they don't need the money, his concern isn't about financial stability but about his self-esteem. \n\nHis wife has already made a sacrifice by putting her grad school plans aside to support him. Now she's considering another path for herself. The author is discouraging her because of personal feelings rather than objective reasons. That could be seen as wrong because it's about his insecurities rather than supporting her goals. \n\nHowever, maybe there's some consideration about the practicality of her changing careers. But the author didn't argue against the practicality; he just focused on his feelings. If her parents are covering the costs, then the financial barrier is gone, making it easier for her to pursue this. \n\nIn terms of fairness, a healthy relationship should support each other's growth. If he's preventing her from doing what she wants for selfish reasons, that's problematic. The fact that he admitted he's not happy could affect their relationship dynamics. \n\nSo, the answer is likely A (he's in the wrong) because his reasons are based on his ego and he's not supporting his wife's aspirations. But I need to make sure there's no other angle. Maybe there's something about the career change being impractical, but the question doesn't mention that. The main issue is his personal feelings versus her goals. Yeah, I think A is the right choice here.\n"
