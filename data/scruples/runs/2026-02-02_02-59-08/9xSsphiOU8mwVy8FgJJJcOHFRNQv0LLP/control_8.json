I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting his wife to pursue a career that would make her earn more than him.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author's wife is considering going back to grad school, funded by her wealthy parents. Her current job is something she loves, but the new path would lead to higher earnings. The author is against it because he feels his role as the primary earner is important to him, and he might feel emasculated if she makes more. They don't plan to have kids, so there's no financial necessity. The wife had paused her grad school plans earlier for the relationship.\n\nNow, the key points here are the author's motivations. He's not worried about financial stability or practical reasons. It's more about his ego and feeling that being the breadwinner is essential. That's a red flag because a healthy relationship should support each other's goals regardless of income. The wife is making a choice based on her interests and her parents' support, which is a valid reason to pursue further education.\n\nThe author's stance seems to be based on his own insecurities rather than the couple's actual needs. It's important to respect each other's aspirations. If he's not supporting her because of his own feelings about status, that's a problem. The wife deserves to pursue her dreams without being held back by her partner's ego.\n\nAlso, the fact that they can live comfortably on his salary alone means there's no financial pressure. The author's argument about stability isn't valid here. It's more about his personal feelings, which shouldn't dictate her career choices. In a healthy relationship, both partners should encourage each other's growth and happiness, even if it means their roles change.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is in the wrong because he's imposing his own insecurities onto his wife's career decisions. The answer should be A.\n"
