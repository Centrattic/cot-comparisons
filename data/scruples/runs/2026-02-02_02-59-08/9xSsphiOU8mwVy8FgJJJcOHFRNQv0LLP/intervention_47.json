I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting his wife to pursue a career that would make her earn more than him. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The husband makes enough for them to live comfortably, and his wife currently makes less. She's been working but put her grad school plans on hold to support them financially. Now, her wealthy parents are offering to pay for her grad degree, which would lead to a higher salary. The husband is against it because he feels emasculated if she makes more than him.\n\nThe key points here are the husband's motivations. He admits that he's not happy with her going to grad school because he likes being the breadwinner and feels emasculated if he makes less. That's a personal feeling, but it's affecting her career choice. The wife, on the other hand, wants to pursue her dream, even though she loves her current job. \n\nNow, considering societal norms, it's generally encouraged for individuals to pursue their career goals regardless of their partner's earnings. The husband's objection is based on his ego rather than practical reasons like family finances. Since they don't plan to have kids and already live comfortably, there's no financial necessity for her to earn more. \n\nHowever, the husband might argue that he's supporting the relationship financially, which is a valid point. But the wife's decision to further her education is her own, and it's important for her personal fulfillment. The husband's feelings of emasculation shouldn't override her desires unless there's a mutual agreement. Also, the wife contributed by working full-time during his master's, so it's a two-way support system. \n\nThe husband's stance could be seen as controlling or restrictive. He's prioritizing his own feelings over her potential growth. Even though he's upfront about his reasoning, it's still a problem because it's imposing his insecurities on her. The wife might feel pressured, especially since she's excited about the opportunity. \n\nIn relationships, respect for each other's goals is crucial. The husband's opposition here isn't based on her best interests but his own. So yes, he's in the wrong. The answer should be A.\n"
