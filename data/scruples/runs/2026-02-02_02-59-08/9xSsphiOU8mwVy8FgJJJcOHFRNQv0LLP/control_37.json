I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting his wife to pursue a career that would make her earn more than him. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The wife already has a job she loves and is content. Her parents are offering to pay for her graduate studies, which would lead to a higher salary. The author is against it mainly because he feels it would make him feel emasculated if she earns more. He's the primary breadwinner now, and he likes that role. \n\nThe question is whether his reasons are valid. The author's main concern is his own ego and self-worth tied to being the higher earner. However, the wife is pursuing her own dream, which was on hold before due to supporting the couple. Her parents are covering the costs, so there's no financial burden on the couple. The author's objection is not about practical issues like financial strain or the wife's happiness, but about his personal feelings.\n\nIn relationships, supporting each other's goals and growth is usually encouraged. The author's refusal to support her ambition because of his own insecurities might be seen as self-centered. The fact that they don't plan to have kids removes the necessity for combined income, so his argument about needing to increase earnings isn't valid here. His feelings of emasculation are personal, but they shouldn't override his partner's career aspirations. \n\nHowever, it's also important to note that the author is honest about his feelings, which is a positive step. But the core issue is whether he's wrong to prioritize his ego over his wife's career. Since the wife's happiness and goals are at stake, and the author's reasons are based on his own insecurities rather than practical concerns, it's likely he's in the wrong. The answer would be A (Yes, he's in the wrong) because his opposition stems from personal insecurity rather than valid reasons related to their financial stability or her well-being.\n"
