I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting his wife to pursue a career that would make her earn more than him. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author makes enough for both of them to live comfortably. His wife currently works but earns less than half of his salary. They don't plan to have kids, so the financial need isn't there. The wife had put her grad school plans on hold to support him during his studies and ended up in a job she loves. Now, her parents are offering to pay for her grad school in a field that could lead to a higher salary. The author is against this because he feels emasculated at the thought of her making more than him.\n\nSo, the main issue here is the author's emotional reaction based on traditional gender roles. He's prioritizing his own feelings over his wife's potential happiness and career growth. Even though he's financially providing for them, the wife has her own aspirations that she's excited about. Her parents are supporting her education, which is a positive aspect. The author's reasoning is that he likes being the breadwinner, which stems from a sense of ego or traditional masculinity expectations. \n\nIn modern relationships, equality and mutual support are valued. The author's reluctance isn't about practical concerns (since they don't need more money) but rather his own insecurities. By not supporting her pursuit, he might be stifling her personal growth. Also, the wife already made a sacrifice before by putting her studies on hold to support him. Now, it's his turn to support her dreams. The fact that he's not happy but can't provide a valid reason beyond his own feelings indicates he might be in the wrong. \n\nAnother angle: financial dynamics in a relationship shouldn't be about one person being above the other. If both want to pursue their goals, it's a sign of a healthy partnership. The author's stance could lead to resentment if his wife feels unsupported. Therefore, the answer is likely A (Yes, he's in the wrong).\n"
