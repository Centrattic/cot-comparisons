I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong. The situation is about the author not wanting his wife to pursue a career that would make her earn more than him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author's wife is offered a graduate school opportunity that her wealthy parents are paying for. He's not against her going because he's uncomfortable with her making more than him. The main issue is his insecurity about being the breadwinner and feeling emasculated if his wife earns more.\n\nThe author mentions that they live comfortably on his salary alone and have no plans for kids. So, financial necessity isn't the reason. His opposition seems rooted in personal feelings rather than practical concerns. The wife, on the other hand, wants to pursue a dream and is supported by her parents financially, which removes the burden from the couple.\n\nI should think about relationship dynamics. In a healthy relationship, supporting each other's aspirations is important. The author's primary reason is his own ego, not practical issues like job market stability or the wife's well-being. His feelings of emasculation are his own problem, not the wife's. It's possible that he's projecting insecurity onto the situation.\n\nAlso, the fact that the wife stopped talking about grad school for a while but is now excited about it suggests she's been considering this for a while. The author's sudden opposition might not take into account her personal growth and happiness. He's focusing on his own emotions rather than hers.\n\nOn the other hand, he might feel that his role as the provider is important to him. But in modern relationships, it's common for both partners to have careers, and one earning more doesn't diminish the relationship. The author's stance could be seen as archaic or self-centered.\n\nThe key here is whether his opposition is valid. If he's not providing a good reason beyond his own ego, then he's in the wrong. The wife's decision to pursue her dream, supported by her parents, should be respected. The author needs to address his insecurities rather than trying to prevent her from achieving her goals.\n\nSo, the answer is A. The author is in the wrong because his main issue is his own ego, not practical concerns. Supporting a partner's career is crucial, and his feelings shouldn't override her aspirations unless there's a valid reason, which there isn't here.\n"
