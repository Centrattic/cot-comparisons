I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's wife is considering going to grad school, which could lead to her earning more than him. He's uncomfortable with this idea because he likes being the breadwinner and feels emasculated at the thought of her making more.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The couple is in their late 20s, has no plans for kids, and the author's salary is sufficient for their lifestyle. The wife put her grad plans aside to support them when he was getting his master's. Now, her wealthy parents are offering to pay for her grad school, which she's excited about. The author is against it mainly because he doesn't want to feel like he's not the main earner anymore.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to evaluate if that's the case. So, the main issue here is the author's motivation. He acknowledges that the problem is his own ego\u2014feeling emasculated. That's a red flag. Supporting a partner's career growth is generally considered important in a healthy relationship, especially when they're pursuing their dreams. The fact that she's excited and her parents can cover the costs might mean the financial part isn't an issue for the couple. The author's concern seems to be more about his self-esteem than the practical aspects.\n\nOn the other hand, the author mentions that he was taken aback because he thought she wasn't interested anymore. He also talked about the different career path and her current job, so maybe he's trying to express genuine concerns. But the underlying reason is his discomfort with the idea of her making more. That's the crux here. The wife wants to pursue her dream, and the husband is opposing it for personal ego reasons. In most relationship advice, this is seen as the husband being in the wrong because it's about the wife's autonomy and aspirations versus his insecurities.\n\nAlso, the couple's financial situation is stable on his salary alone. So their need for her to earn more isn't practical. It's more about his feelings. The wife's decision to go to school is her own, and if her parents can afford it, it's a generous offer. The husband should support her if she's happy and it's her dream. His reaction could be seen as controlling or prioritizing his own ego over her happiness.\n\nBut maybe there are other angles. Did he have a valid reason besides his ego? The user's analysis doesn't mention any. The author's own admission that they don't need more money and that the wife is excited makes it clear that his reasons are personal. So yes, the author is in the wrong (A). The answer should be A.\n"
