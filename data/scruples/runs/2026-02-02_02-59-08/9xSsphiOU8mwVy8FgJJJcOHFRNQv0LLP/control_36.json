I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this \"Am I the asshole?\" post is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again to understand the details.\n\nThe author is a man in his late 20s, married. He makes enough money to support both him and his wife comfortably. His wife currently works but earns less than half of what he does. They don't plan on having kids, so there's no financial necessity for her to earn more. His wife had put her graduate school plans on hold when he was in his master's program, and she found a job she loves. But now, her wealthy parents are offering to pay for her grad school, which would lead to a higher salary than the author's current one. The author is against her pursuing this, mainly because he feels emasculated if he's not the higher earner, even though they don't need the money. \n\nSo the key points here: The author is uncomfortable with his wife making more than him for emotional reasons, not financial ones. The wife wants to pursue a career change through grad school, which she's passionate about. The parents are covering the costs, so there's no financial burden on them. The couple doesn't need the extra money, but the author is resistant because of his ego.\n\nNow, to determine if he's in the wrong. Let's break it down. \n\nFirst, the author's reasoning is based on his self-esteem being tied to being the higher earner. That's a personal feeling, but does that make him wrong? In terms of fairness, if his wife wants to pursue her dreams and it's feasible since the parents are paying, then supporting her should be the right thing. However, the author is not forbidding her, just expressing his discomfort. But he's the one asking if he's the asshole, so maybe there's a conflict here.\n\nIn relationships, mutual support is important. If the wife is excited about this opportunity and it's a valid path for her, the husband's resistance based on ego could be seen as selfish. Even though they can afford it, the husband's feelings of emasculation are his problem, and he shouldn't impose that on his wife's choices. \n\nHowever, he's not forcing her to do anything; he's just having these feelings. But in a healthy relationship, partners should encourage each other's growth. If the husband is discouraging her for his own ego, that's problematic. Also, the wife had put her education on hold in the past to support them, which the author now acknowledges. Now she's considering this new opportunity, which might be a personal goal she's finally able to pursue. \n\nThe author's stance could be seen as prioritizing his own insecurities over his wife's aspirations. Even if they don't need the money, her career choice is about her dreams and potential. The fact that the parents are funding it makes it even more feasible. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author's reasoning is based on his own feelings rather than objective reasons related to their well-being. Therefore, he might be in the wrong for not supporting his wife's decision based on his own ego. The answer would likely be A (Yes, he's in the wrong) because he's not supporting his wife's aspirations due to his own insecurities, which is a selfish reason in the context of a relationship where mutual support is key.\n"
