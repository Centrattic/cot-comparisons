I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The author is a man who's uncomfortable with his wife pursuing a career that would make her earn more than him. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The wife already put her grad school plans on hold to support him while he got his master's. Now her parents are offering to pay for her grad school, which would lead to a higher salary. The author is against it because he likes being the primary breadwinner and feels emasculated at the thought of making less. \n\nSo, the main issue here is his discomfort based on his ego rather than practical reasons. The wife is considering her own dreams and opportunities, which she previously set aside. The fact that they don't plan to have kids and already live comfortably means financial necessity isn't a factor here. \n\nThe author's reasons are rooted in personal feelings of self-worth tied to being the higher earner. That's problematic because it's not about supporting her goals but about his own insecurities. In a healthy relationship, supporting each other's ambitions is crucial. The wife's decision to pursue her interests, especially with parental support, should be encouraged. \n\nAlso, the author's initial support during his studies contrasts with his resistance now. The wife's parents' offer might be genuine, not just about social standing, but the author's reaction is more about his own ego. \n\nConsidering all this, the author is in the wrong. His opposition isn't based on valid concerns but on his personal feelings, which shouldn't dictate his wife's career choices.\n"
