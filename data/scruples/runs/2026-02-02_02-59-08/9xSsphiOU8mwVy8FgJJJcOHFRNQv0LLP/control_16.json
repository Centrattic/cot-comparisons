I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting his wife to pursue a career that would make her earn more than him. \n\nFirst, the author's main reasons are about feeling emasculated and being the breadwinner. His wife is considering going back to grad school, which her parents are funding, leading to a higher salary than his current one. They don't plan to have kids, so there's no financial necessity for her to earn more.\n\nI need to consider if his feelings are valid. It's true that people can have insecurities, but the question is whether his opposition is justified. The wife is making her own career choice, and the author's primary concern is his own ego. That seems problematic because a partner's career decisions should be respected regardless of financial implications.\n\nAlso, the author acknowledges that his wife previously put her education on hold to support them. Now she's being offered an opportunity, and he's resisting based on personal feelings rather than practical reasons. There's a power dynamic here; he's the main earner, and his hesitation might stem from a sense of loss of control or self-worth tied to being the breadwinner.\n\nSociety is moving towards more equality in partnerships, so prioritizing one's own ego over a partner's aspirations could be seen as regressive. The fact that they don't need the money makes it even more about his personal feelings rather than necessity. \n\nHowever, the author might argue that he's trying to maintain stability. But if the wife is passionate and the opportunity is available without financial burden (since her parents are covering it), his resistance could hinder her growth. The key point is whether his feelings are a valid reason to discourage her. \n\nIn relationships, mutual support is crucial. If the author can't support her decision without resentment, it might affect their partnership negatively. The answer likely leans towards A (author in the wrong) because his stance is based on his own insecurities rather than objective reasons, and it could undermine his wife's autonomy and happiness.\n"
