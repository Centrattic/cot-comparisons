I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The question is about whether it's acceptable for him to not want his wife to pursue a career that would make her earn more than him.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is a man in his late 20s married to a woman who also works but earns less. They don't plan on having kids, so there's no financial necessity for her to make more. The wife had put her grad school plans on hold when he was in school, and now her wealthy parents are offering to pay for her to go back to grad school, which would lead to a higher salary. The author is against this mainly because he doesn't want to be the lower earner and feels emasculated by the idea.\n\nThe key points here are his reasons for opposing her career move. He admits it's about feeling like the breadwinner and his ego. There's no mention of other valid concerns like financial strain or her not being suited for the new field. The wife loves her current job but wants to follow her dream. The author's objection seems rooted in personal insecurity rather than practical reasons.\n\nIn terms of fairness, a healthy relationship should support each other's ambitions and dreams. The fact that his main argument is about his own ego and not about practical issues (like financial needs or her suitability for the new program) suggests that he's prioritizing his own feelings over her aspirations. Even though they can afford it, the emotional aspect of her pursuing her dream versus his insecurities is a conflict of personal values.\n\nAlso, the wife already made a sacrifice by putting her education on hold to support him when he was in school. Now she's considering this new opportunity, which is her right. The author's resistance might be undermining her autonomy and growth. It's important that the decision is hers to make, and his feelings shouldn't override her desires unless there's a mutual agreement or valid concern. Since there's no such valid concern here, the author is indeed in the wrong for prioritizing his ego over her aspirations.\n"
