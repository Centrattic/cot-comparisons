I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the husband doesn't want his wife to pursue a career that would make her earn more than him. He feels emasculated at the thought of her making more money, even though he's the main breadwinner now and they don't need the extra income.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The husband acknowledges his feelings of emasculation, which is a big red flag. He's projecting his insecurities onto the situation. The wife has the opportunity for grad school funded by her parents, which would lead to a higher salary. She's passionate about this new path, even though it's different from her current job. The husband's main issue isn't about her career or their financial needs but his own ego.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics of a healthy relationship, supporting each other's career goals is essential. The husband is discouraging his wife's ambitions because of his own self-esteem issues. That's a clear sign of being in the wrong. The wife has a valid reason to pursue her dreams, especially with financial support from her parents. The husband's financial stability shouldn't be a barrier; in fact, it's a good position to support her growth. \n\nAlso, the fact that they don't plan to have kids removes the necessity for her to stay in her current job for financial reasons. Her career choice is personal and about her aspirations. The husband's resistance is rooted in his insecurities rather than practical concerns. In modern relationships, equality and mutual support are crucial. Feeling emasculated by a partner earning more is outdated and selfish. The husband needs to address his own issues instead of limiting his wife's potential. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
