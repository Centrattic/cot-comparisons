I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the husband) is in the wrong for not wanting his wife to pursue a career that would make her earn more than him. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the context provided. The husband makes enough to support both their lives comfortably. The wife currently works but earns less than half of his salary. Her parents offered to pay for her graduate education, which would lead to a higher salary. The husband's main issue is that he feels emasculated if his wife earns more than him, even though they don't need the money and she wants to pursue a different career path.\n\nThe key points here are the husband's emotional response versus the wife's desire for personal fulfillment. The husband admits that the main reason is his own ego and the feeling of being the breadwinner. The question is whether his stance is wrong because it's based on his own insecurities rather than objective reasons like financial necessity.\n\nIn relationships, respecting each other's aspirations is usually considered important. The husband is discouraging his wife from pursuing her dreams because of his own feelings about status. Even though he acknowledges that his reasoning might be unpopular, the wife's happiness and personal growth are her own priorities. The husband's decision could be seen as controlling or dismissive of her goals. \n\nAlso, the wife is making a choice that's supported by her parents, so there's no financial burden on the couple. The husband's argument that they don't need the money is a separate issue from the wife's desire to advance her career. \n\nFrom a societal perspective, traditional gender roles might influence the husband's feelings, but modern values emphasize equality and mutual support in relationships. The husband's insecurity might indicate deeper personal issues rather than a valid reason to oppose her career choice.\n\nSo, putting this together, the husband is prioritizing his own ego over his wife's aspirations. This is likely wrong because it's about his own feelings rather than her well-being or the relationship's health. Therefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
