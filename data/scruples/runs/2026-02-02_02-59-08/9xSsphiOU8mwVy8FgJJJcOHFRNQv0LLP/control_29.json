I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for not wanting his wife to pursue a career that would make her earn more than him. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author and his wife are in their late 20s, and he's the main breadwinner. She's working but earns less than half of what he does. They don't plan to have kids, so they don't need more money. His wife put her grad school plans on hold to work full-time when he was in school. Now her wealthy parents are offering to fund her grad school, which would put her on a path to earn more than him. He's against it because he feels it would make him feel emasculated if she makes more. \n\nThe author's reasoning is based on his own feelings of self-worth tied to being the breadwinner. He feels that making less would affect his sense of masculinity. However, the wife is excited about her opportunity and seems to have a genuine interest in pursuing her dream, even though she loves her current job. The author's main objection isn't about practical reasons like financial strain or her unhappiness but about his own ego.\n\nNow, considering societal norms and relationships, it's generally considered healthy for both partners to pursue their individual growth and career goals. The author's stance is rooted in traditional gender roles where the man is supposed to be the primary earner. However, modern relationships often prioritize mutual support and equality. The fact that the author's objection is based on self-esteem issues rather than the wife's best interests could be a problem. He's not considering her aspirations and is instead focusing on his own insecurities. \n\nAlso, the wife's parents are offering to fund her education, so there's no financial burden on the couple. The author's argument that they don't need more money is valid, but that doesn't negate her desire to pursue her own path. The key issue here is whether the author is respecting his wife's autonomy and her right to make her own career decisions. \n\nIn many cases, supporting a partner's career, even if it leads to them earning more, is seen as a sign of a healthy relationship. The author is not in the right because his objection is based on his personal feelings rather than the wife's needs or happiness. He should be supportive of her growth, regardless of the impact on his ego. \n\nTherefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
