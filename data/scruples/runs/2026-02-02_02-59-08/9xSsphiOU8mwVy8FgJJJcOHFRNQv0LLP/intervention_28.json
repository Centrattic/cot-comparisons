I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong. The main issue is that the author doesn't want his wife to pursue a career that would make her earn more than him. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author is a man in his late 20s, married. He's the primary earner, and they don't plan to have kids. His wife is considering going back to grad school, which her parents are funding. She's excited about it, but the author is hesitant. He admits the reason is because he feels emasculated if she makes more than him. \n\nHmm, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Let's look at the dynamics here. The wife had already put her grad studies on hold to support the couple financially when he was in his master's. Now, with the opportunity to go back, she's pursuing her dream. The author's main objection is his own ego\u2014feeling that making less would affect his self-worth or societal expectations.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, this seems to touch on gender roles and personal autonomy. The wife has her own aspirations, and the author is restricting her based on his insecurities. Even though their financial situation is stable, the wife's career choice is her own. The author's concern about being the breadwinner is more about his personal feelings rather than practical needs.\n\nI should also consider if there are other factors. The couple doesn't have kids, so the need for dual income isn't there. But that's not a reason to stop her from pursuing her goals. The wife's happiness and fulfilling her dreams are important. The author's feelings, while valid, shouldn't override her autonomy. \n\nSocietal norms often pressure men to be the higher earner, but in modern relationships, mutual support and respect are key. The author's reasoning is based on insecurity and traditional gender roles, which can be seen as outdated. The wife's decision to pursue her education and career should be supported, regardless of his earnings.\n\nTherefore, the author is in the wrong because he's letting his personal insecurities interfere with his wife's aspirations. He should support her decision instead of focusing on his ego.\n"
