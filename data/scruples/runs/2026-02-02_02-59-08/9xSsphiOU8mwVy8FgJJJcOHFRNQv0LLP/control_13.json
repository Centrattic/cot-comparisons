I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting his wife to pursue a career that might make her earn more than him. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author's wife is considering going back to grad school, which would lead to a higher salary than him. The author is against it because he feels it might make him feel emasculated, even though he says they're financially stable. He mentions that he's the primary breadwinner and likes that. The wife already put her grad plans on hold earlier to support him when he was in school.\n\nHmm, so the main issue here is the author's motivation. He's not opposing the career move for her sake, like if it's a bad fit or too stressful, but because of his own ego. That seems problematic. He admits he's grown to like being the breadwinner and feels emasculated if he makes less. That's a personal insecurity that shouldn't dictate his wife's career choices. \n\nAlso, the wife's parents are offering to cover the costs, so financial burden isn't an issue. The wife wants to pursue her dream, which she loves her current job but still feels drawn to another path. The author's opposition is based on his own feelings rather than valid reasons related to their financial needs or her well-being.\n\nBut wait, he does mention they don't have kids and his salary is enough. So there's no necessity for her to work. But she already works, so maybe she wants a different career for personal fulfillment. The author's stance is about his own ego, not about their financial situation. That's a key point. \n\nIn a healthy relationship, supporting each other's aspirations is important. The author is prioritizing his own feelings over his wife's potential happiness and growth. Even if he doesn't agree with her decision, it's her choice. So, yes, he's in the wrong for letting his insecurities affect her career decisions. The answer should be A.\n"
