I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting his wife to pursue a career that would make her earn more than him. The situation involves his wife's potential career change with her parents' financial support. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author's main concern is about being the breadwinner and feeling emasculated if his wife makes more. He acknowledges that his wife is willing to take a different path, which she loves, but he's resistant. His wife previously put her grad school plans on hold to support them financially when he was in school. Now, her parents are offering full funding for her grad program, which could lead to a higher salary.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, the wife is being offered an opportunity to pursue her education and career without financial burden. The author's objection seems to stem from personal insecurity rather than practical concerns like financial stability. Since they don't need more money and have two incomes already, the issue isn't about necessity but about his feelings of self-worth tied to being the higher earner.\n\nAlso, the wife's decision to go back to school is her personal choice, especially with her parents covering costs. The author's hesitation might infringe on her autonomy. Supporting a partner's growth is generally important in a healthy relationship. His focus on his own emotional state over her aspirations could be seen as selfish or controlling.\n\nHowever, maybe there are valid concerns about the feasibility of switching careers or the time commitment of grad school. The author did raise these points, so he's not entirely dismissive. But the main issue is his emotional reaction based on self-esteem. \n\nIn relationships, mutual support and individual growth are crucial. If the author is hindering his wife's goals due to his own insecurities, that's problematic. The wife's happiness and professional development matter as much as the author's feelings. The answer likely leans towards the author being in the wrong because his reasoning is based on personal feelings rather than objective reasons related to their financial situation or his wife's best interests.\n"
