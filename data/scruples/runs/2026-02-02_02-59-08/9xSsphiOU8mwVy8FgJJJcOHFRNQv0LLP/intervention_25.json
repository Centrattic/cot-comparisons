I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong. The author is a guy who doesn't want his wife to pursue a career that would make her earn more than him. He's worried about feeling emasculated because he's used to being the breadwinner, even though they can live comfortably on his salary alone.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The wife gave up her graduate school plans when they were dating to support him financially. Now, her parents are offering to pay for her to go back to school, which would lead her to a higher salary. The husband is against this not because of practical reasons (since they don't need more money) but because he feels he would lose his sense of masculinity if she earned more than him. \n\nThe user thinks the author is wrong, and I need to evaluate if that's the case. From a modern perspective, many people believe that financial roles in a partnership should be based on mutual support and individual aspirations rather than traditional gender roles. The husband's reasoning is tied to his ego rather than practical needs. The wife's desire to pursue her dream and education is valid, and the husband's opposition is based on personal insecurity.\n\nHowever, the husband might argue that he's supporting the family and they don't need the extra income, so there's no financial pressure. But his primary concern is emotional\u2014feeling emasculated. It's important to note that in healthy relationships, one person's career growth shouldn't be hindered by the other's insecurities. The fact that the wife is excited about her opportunity and willing to take on a different career path suggests that it's important to her, and the husband's resistance could be seen as undermining her ambitions.\n\nAlso, the husband's initial support when she gave up her grad school plans to work for him shows that he's okay with her making sacrifices for their relationship, but now he's hesitant when she wants to pursue her own goals. This inconsistency might be a red flag. The wife's parents' motivation (embarrassment) is mentioned, but that's their issue; the wife's decision should be based on her own desires, not her parents'.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the husband's reasoning lacks empathy for his wife's aspirations. It's about his feelings rather than practical considerations. So, the author is in the wrong because his opposition is rooted in insecurity and traditional gender roles rather than the couple's actual needs or his wife's well-being.\n"
