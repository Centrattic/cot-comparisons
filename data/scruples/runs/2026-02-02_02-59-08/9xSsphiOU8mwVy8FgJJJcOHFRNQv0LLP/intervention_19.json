I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The situation is about the author not wanting his wife to pursue a career that would make her earn more than him.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author and his wife are in their late 20s. He's the primary earner, and she works but makes less than half of his salary. They don't plan on having kids, so there's no financial need for more income. The wife had paused her grad school plans to support them financially, and now her wealthy parents are offering to pay for her grad school, which would lead her to a higher salary. The author is against this because he feels emasculated at the thought of being the lower earner, even though they live comfortably. He also mentions he's okay with supporting her financially, but the idea of her making more than him makes him uncomfortable.\n\nSo, the main issue here is his emotional discomfort tied to traditional gender roles. The wife has her own aspirations, and the author is resisting her pursuit because of his own ego. The question is whether that makes him the asshole.\n\nI should consider if the author's reasons are valid. The wife's decision is about her own career and fulfillment, not necessarily about surpassing him. The author acknowledges that they don't need the money, so it's not a financial necessity. His reasoning is based on his own feelings of emasculation, which is a personal issue. In a healthy relationship, supporting each other's goals is important. If he's discouraging her because of his own insecurities, that could be seen as selfish. However, if he's genuinely concerned about the practical aspects, like the career change being drastic, but the wife is still committed, then it's more about her autonomy.\n\nAnother angle is the power dynamic. The author is the primary earner, and his resistance might be about maintaining that status. The wife's parents are offering financial support, so she's not asking him to fund her education. The author's objection isn't about the financial burden on them as a couple but about his personal feelings. That seems more about his ego than practical concerns.\n\nAlso, the wife has already made sacrifices before\u2014putting her grad school on hold to support their finances. Now she's considering going back for her own dream. The author's reaction could be dismissive of her aspirations. In a partnership, both should support each other's growth unless there are valid practical reasons. Since the author's main issue is his own insecurities, it's hard to justify as a legitimate reason to discourage her.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's reasoning is based on his own emotional needs rather than objective reasons. Supporting a partner's career and personal growth is usually seen as important in a healthy relationship. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because he's prioritizing his own ego over his wife's aspirations without valid reasons.\n"
