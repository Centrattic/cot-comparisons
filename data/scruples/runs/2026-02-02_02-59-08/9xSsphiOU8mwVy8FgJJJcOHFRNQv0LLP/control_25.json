I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting his wife to pursue a career that would make her earn more than him. \n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The author mentions that he's the primary breadwinner, and his wife currently makes less. Her parents are offering to pay for her grad school, which would lead to a higher salary than his. The main issue is his fear of feeling emasculated if she earns more. \n\nThe wife previously put her grad plans on hold to support the relationship, so she's made sacrifices. Now she's interested in pursuing her dream again, which is a different career path. The author's objection is based on his own ego rather than practical reasons like financial necessity or the wife's well-being. \n\nIn relationships, it's important to support each other's ambitions. The author's reasoning centers around his self-esteem, which isn't a valid reason to discourage someone from advancing their career. Even though their financial situation is stable, the wife's right to pursue her goals shouldn't be hindered by the husband's insecurities. \n\nThere's no mention of the wife needing the money, just that she wants to follow her passion. The author's stance could be seen as controlling or not respecting her aspirations. Most people value mutual support in a relationship, and prioritizing one's ego over a partner's happiness and growth is generally considered wrong.\n\nSo, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because his objections are based on personal insecurity rather than valid concerns for his wife's best interests.\n"
