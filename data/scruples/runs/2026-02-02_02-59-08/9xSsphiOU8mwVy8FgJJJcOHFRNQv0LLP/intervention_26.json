I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting his wife to pursue a career that would make her earn more than him. The scenario involves the wife considering grad school, which would lead to a higher salary, and the husband's main objection is about feeling emasculated.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The husband's wife is already working, but he's the primary breadwinner. They don't plan to have kids, so maybe financial needs aren't a barrier. The wife's parents are offering to pay for her grad school, and she wants to follow her passion. The husband's objection is mainly about his ego\u2014feeling emasculated if she earns more. \n\nFrom a fairness perspective, the husband's concern seems to stem from personal insecurity rather than practical reasons. The wife is pursuing her own goals and interests, which is her right. The husband's role as the main earner isn't a valid reason to prevent her from advancing her career. Also, the fact that they can live comfortably doesn't negate her desire for personal growth or professional fulfillment.\n\nAdditionally, the husband's perspective is that he's the one who supported them during his master's, and the wife had put her plans on hold. Now he's resisting her going back. That could be seen as selfish, especially since she's excited about this opportunity. The husband's feelings about being the breadwinner are his own, but it's not a justification to limit her opportunities. \n\nIn terms of relationship dynamics, supporting each other's aspirations is crucial. The husband's reaction might hinder the wife's personal development and could create resentment. It's important for partners to encourage each other's growth, even if it means changes in their roles. \n\nThe husband's reasoning is based on societal norms about male dominance in earnings, which is outdated and restrictive. The wife's parents' offer is a chance for her to explore a different career path without financial burden, which he's blocking due to his own insecurities. \n\nTherefore, the husband is in the wrong because his objection is not based on practical concerns but on personal ego. The wife has the right to pursue her goals, and the husband should support her decision. The answer should be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
