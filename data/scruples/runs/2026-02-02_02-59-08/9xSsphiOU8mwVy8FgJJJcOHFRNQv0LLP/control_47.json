I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The author is a husband who doesn't want his wife to pursue a career that would make her earn more than him. \n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The husband makes enough for both of them to live comfortably. His wife currently earns less than half of his salary. She put her grad school plans on hold to support him when he got his master's. Now her wealthy parents are offering to pay for her grad school, which would lead to a higher salary than his. The husband is uncomfortable because he feels emasculated if she makes more, even though they don't need the money.\n\nThe core issue here is the husband's insecurity about his role as the primary breadwinner. He's admitting that his feelings of being emasculated are the real reason he's against her pursuing this path. This raises red flags because it's about his ego rather than any practical financial need. The wife is following her dream, which she's excited about, even though she loves her current job. The husband is undermining her aspirations based on his self-esteem issues.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's important to consider the wife's autonomy. She's making a personal decision about her education and career, which are significant choices. The husband's opposition is rooted in his own feelings rather than objective reasons like financial necessity or her well-being. The wife's parents are supporting her education, which is a generous offer, and she's considering it for her own fulfillment.\n\nSocietal views on this might vary, but from a fairness perspective, the husband should support her decision. His feelings shouldn't dictate her future. The fact that they don't plan to have kids removes any traditional need for him to be the sole provider, but he still clings to that role for emotional reasons. This could be seen as controlling or self-centered.\n\nHowever, the husband does mention that they don't need the money, so there's no financial pressure. The wife is making her own choice, and the husband's role is to support her, not hinder her. His insecurity is a personal issue, but it's affecting her autonomy. The answer likely leans towards the author being in the wrong because he's prioritizing his ego over her aspirations and choice.\n"
