I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the original post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author not wanting his wife to pursue a career that would make her earn more than him.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The wife's parents are wealthy and offered to pay for her grad school, which would lead to a higher salary. The author makes enough to support them both comfortably and initially supported her decision to step back from grad school to work full-time. Now, the wife wants to go back to school, and the author is against it because he feels emasculated if she makes more than him.\n\nThe main issue here is the author's resistance based on his own ego. The wife's career choice seems to be about her personal fulfillment and dreams, not about surpassing his income. The author admits that his concern is about feeling like the breadwinner and not being \"good enough\" if he earns less. That's a self-centered motivation. The wife's parents are supporting her education, which is a good opportunity for her. Also, they don't plan to have kids, so financial necessity isn't a factor.\n\nThe author's justification is based on his feelings of self-worth tied to his income compared to his wife's. That's problematic because it's imposing his insecurities onto his wife's career choices. A healthy relationship should support each other's growth, even if it means one partner earns more. The author is prioritizing his own ego over his wife's aspirations. \n\nThe wife has already made a past decision to put grad school on hold, but now she's re-evaluating, which shows her own agency. The author's reaction is about his discomfort rather than the practical aspects of her education or career. It's also worth noting that the wife's parents' offer removes the financial burden, making the decision more about her dreams rather than cost.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author is indeed in the wrong. He's letting his personal insecurities interfere with his wife's opportunities. The right approach would be to support her decision, regardless of the salary outcome. Therefore, the answer should be A.\n"
