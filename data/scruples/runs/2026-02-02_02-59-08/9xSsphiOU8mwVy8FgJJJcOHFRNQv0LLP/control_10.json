I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is at fault here. The situation is that the author's wife wants to pursue a career that would make her earn more than him. The author is against it because he feels it would make him feel emasculated since he's the current breadwinner.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author's reasoning is based on his personal feelings about being the primary earner and not wanting to make less than his wife. His wife is considering grad school, which her parents are funding, and it's a different career path from her current job. They don't plan to have kids, so there's no financial necessity. The author acknowledges his feelings are unpopular but is questioning if he's in the wrong.\n\nFrom a societal perspective, traditional gender roles might influence the author's perspective. However, modern relationships often emphasize equality and mutual support. The author is concerned about his own ego and emotional state, which is a personal issue. The wife is making a career decision, which is her right. The fact that she's considering a different path she's passionate about adds another layer. The author's main argument is about his emotional response rather than practical concerns like financial stability or the wife's happiness.\n\nIt's important to consider whether the author's feelings justify hindering his wife's aspirations. If the wife is happy and this is her dream, the author's opposition based solely on his own ego might be seen as selfish. Healthy relationships require supporting each other's goals. The author's admission that he would feel emasculated is a red flag; it shows he's projecting his insecurities onto the relationship.\n\nHowever, the author is also being honest about his feelings and not forcing her to do anything. He's not actively stopping her, just expressing doubts. The question is whether his opposition is valid. Since the wife is making the decision for herself and the couple's financial situation is secure, the author's stance might be seen as invalid. The real issue is his self-worth being tied to his income relative to his wife's.\n\nIn conclusion, the author is in the wrong because his opposition is based on his own insecurities rather than the wife's best interests. The correct answer is A.\n"
