I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about the husband not wanting his wife to pursue a graduate degree that would lead her to earn more than him. Let me break down the key points.\n\nFirst, the husband makes enough for them to live comfortably, and his wife currently earns less than half of his salary. She put her grad school plans on hold to work full-time when he was in his master's. Now her wealthy parents are offering to pay for her grad school, which would lead to a higher salary than his. He's against it because he feels it would make him feel emasculated if she earns more.\n\nHmm, the main issue here is his personal feeling about being the breadwinner. Is it wrong to feel that way? On one hand, he's honest about his feelings and isn't forcing her. But on the other hand, supporting a spouse's career growth is generally seen as important in a healthy relationship. His reasoning is based on his own ego, which might not be fair to her. She's made a significant sacrifice before by postponing her education to support him. Now she's excited about this opportunity, and he's resisting it because of his own insecurity.\n\nAlso, they don't plan on having kids, so there's no financial necessity. Her parents are covering the costs, so it's not a financial burden on them. The husband's reluctance is more about his self-perception. Society is moving towards more equality, so valuing a partner's career growth and personal fulfillment is important. If he can't support her because of his ego, that might be a problem in their relationship. He should consider her happiness and her career aspirations over his own feelings of masculinity.\n\nSo, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because his opposition is based on personal insecurity rather than practical reasons, and it disregards his wife's aspirations and the support he expects from her (even if he didn't state it directly). Healthy relationships require mutual support, and his stance could hinder her growth.\n"
