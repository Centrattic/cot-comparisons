I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting his wife to pursue a career that could make her earn more than him.\n\nFirst, the author's main concern seems to be his own ego. He feels emasculated if he makes less than his wife. He acknowledges that his wife has a job she loves, but he's resistant to her going to grad school for reasons tied to his self-esteem. He mentions that they don't need more money since his salary alone supports them comfortably. \n\nThe wife's parents are offering to cover her education costs, which removes financial barriers. The wife previously put her grad school plans on hold to support the couple, but now she's interested again. The author's hesitation is based on his feelings about being the primary breadwinner, not on practical concerns like financial need or her happiness.\n\nIn terms of equality and mutual support in a relationship, it's important for partners to encourage each other's ambitions. The author's reluctance is more about his own insecurities rather than the wife's best interests. This could be seen as a lack of support for her personal goals. The fact that they don't plan to have kids doesn't change the fact that both should be able to pursue their desires without judgment. \n\nSociety is moving towards more equal partnerships where financial roles aren't as rigid. The author's admission that he would feel emasculated suggests a traditional view that might not be healthy for a modern relationship. The wife's happiness and career growth might be more important than his ego. \n\nSo, the author is in the wrong because his opposition is based on personal ego rather than objective reasons related to their financial stability or the wife's well-being. He should support her decision if it makes her happy, regardless of income comparison.\n"
