I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author (the husband) is in the wrong for not wanting his wife to pursue a career that would make her earn more than him. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The husband makes enough for both of them to live comfortably. His wife currently earns less than half of his salary. She had put her grad school plans on hold to work full-time when they were together, and now her parents are offering to cover her education costs for a program that would lead to a higher salary. The husband is against it because he feels emasculated if she makes more than him, even though they don't need the extra money.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the husband's feelings about being the breadwinner, his wife's autonomy in career choices, and the underlying reasons for his opposition. \n\nThe husband admits that his main issue is feeling emasculated if his wife earns more. That seems to be a personal insecurity rather than a practical concern, especially since they can already live comfortably. The wife is considering this for her own dream and happiness, and the parents are covering the costs, so there's no financial burden on the couple. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, this is a sensitive topic. On one hand, the husband is expressing his feelings, and it's valid for him to feel that way. But on the other hand, his wife's career aspirations and personal growth are important. The husband is essentially prioritizing his own ego over her desires, which might be seen as selfish. Also, the fact that they don't need the extra money makes the financial argument weak. \n\nThe wife's parents' motivation (embarrassment over her not having a graduate degree) might not be a factor in the decision if she's choosing the program for herself. But the husband's reason is purely about his self-esteem, which is a personal issue. \n\nIn relationships, supporting each other's growth is usually encouraged. If the husband is hindering his wife's opportunities based on his own insecurities, that's a problem. So the author might be in the wrong because he's not supporting her choice for her own reasons but is instead focused on his own feelings of being the breadwinner. \n\nAlso, there's the aspect of equality in the relationship. It's not about who earns more but mutual support. The husband's stance could be seen as traditional and possibly limiting his wife's potential. \n\nI think the answer would lean towards the husband being in the wrong (A) because his opposition is based on personal ego and not on practical considerations, and it's important to support a partner's career goals unless there's a valid reason.\n"
