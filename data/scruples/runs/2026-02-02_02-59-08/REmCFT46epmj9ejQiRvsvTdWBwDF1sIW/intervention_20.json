My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about changing a name from a male name (like \"John\") to a nickname that's more girly. The parents named the person after the grandfather, using a male name, and the author is facing teasing because of it. They want to change both their first and last name to a nickname that friends use, but the mom is upset and thinks it's forsaking the grandfather's memory.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author is an adult (21) and making their own decisions. Changing one's name is a personal choice, especially when it affects their identity and well-being. The original name was given by parents, but if the name is causing distress and the person is changing it to something that feels more authentic to them, that might be valid. The mother's disapproval is about honoring the grandfather, but the author argues that the nickname is how they've always been known and it's important for their identity.\n\nThe author's fianc\u00e9 uses the nickname, which supports the idea that this is about personal identity and social acceptance. The mother's reaction is hurtful, but the author has the right to choose their name, especially as an adult. The fact that the name change is to a nickname they've used socially suggests it's not just a whim but a long-standing preference.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, legally and ethically, adults can change their names for any reason they choose. The parents gave the name, but once the person is an adult, it's their decision. The mother's disapproval is a valid emotional concern, but the author isn't necessarily wrong for prioritizing their own comfort and identity. The name change doesn't erase the grandfather's memory unless the author is intentionally trying to, but that's not indicated here. The author is changing both first and last names, which is a big step, but the reasons given seem legitimate.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is likely B (not in the wrong). The author is making a choice that affects their own life and happiness, and while it's disappointing for the mother, it's not the author's fault. They have the autonomy to choose their name as an adult.\n"
