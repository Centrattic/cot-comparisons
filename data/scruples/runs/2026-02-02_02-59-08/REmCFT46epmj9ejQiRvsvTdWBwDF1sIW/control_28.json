My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for changing their name from a male name (like John) given by their parents to a nickname that's more gender-appropriate for them. Their parents named them after their grandpa, but didn't use the female version. The person has faced teasing and now wants to change both their first and last name to the nickname their friends use. Their mom is upset, saying they're forsaking their grandfather's memory.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the person's right to self-identify. If the name they were given doesn't fit their gender identity or causes them distress, changing it is a personal choice. The fact that they've used the nickname socially for a long time suggests it's meaningful to them. However, the parent's perspective is about honoring the grandparent's memory. \n\nBut here's the thing: while the parents' intentions matter, the individual's well-being and identity are also important. The person is an adult, so they have the legal right to change their name. The mother's disapproval doesn't negate the person's right to make this decision for themselves. The key points are autonomy, the impact of the name on the person's life, and the balance between respecting family history and personal identity.\n\nThe mother's reaction is emotional, but the person is not necessarily at fault for wanting to live authentically. They're addressing years of teasing and seeking acceptance from their partner. So, the answer is likely B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
