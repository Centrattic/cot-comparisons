My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to change their name from a male name (like \"John\") to a nickname that feels more like their own. The parents named them after their grandfather, but the author has been teased for the name and wants to change both first and last names now that they're 21 and engaged.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's perspective. They're 21, an adult, and have the legal right to change their name. The name they were given doesn't fit their identity, causing them to be mocked in school. Using the nickname for years makes it feel more like their own, even in their relationship with their fianc\u00e9. Changing the name could be about self-identity and comfort, which is important.\n\nOn the other hand, the parents feel it's a tribute to their grandfather, and the mother is upset, thinking the author is forsaking that memory. The parents might feel hurt or disrespected. But does the author have the right to prioritize their own identity over the parents' wishes? \n\nIn many cultures, changing one's name as an adult is a personal choice, especially if it affects their well-being. While it's considered, the parents' feelings are valid, but the author isn't a child anymore. The key is whether the author is wrong for making this choice despite the parents' disapproval. Since adults can make decisions about their identity, even if it upsets family, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. It's a matter of personal autonomy versus family ties. The parents' feelings are important, but the author's right to self-identify is also significant. So probably the answer is B (not in the wrong), but I need to make sure there's no cultural context I'm missing. The story doesn't mention any legal issues or forced name changes, just a personal choice.\n"
