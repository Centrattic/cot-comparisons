My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person is in the wrong for changing their name from a male name to a female one, which was given in honor of their grandfather. The parents didn't provide a female version, leading to the name being a short male name with no girly nickname. The person has been teased for it and is now 21, engaged, and wants to change both first and last names to a nickname they've used. Their mom is upset and thinks they're dishonoring their grandpa.\n\nFirst, the right to change one's name is generally a personal choice. The person is an adult, so they have the autonomy to make decisions about their identity. The parents' disapproval is a factor, but in many cases, adult children can make decisions that might upset family members. The key points here are the impact on the person's well-being and the family's feelings. The person mentions being teased, which affects their self-esteem, and the nickname has been accepted by friends and fianc\u00e9. However, the mother feels the name change disrespects the grandfather. \n\nBut is the person in the wrong? Well, the mother's feelings are valid, but the person's right to self-identify and their happiness should also be considered. The fact that the name was given with a male name and no female version might be part of the issue. The person isn't just changing the name for fun; they've faced social issues and are using a name that's been accepted for years. The mother's disapproval is hurtful, but the person's autonomy and well-being might take precedence here. So, the answer might be B, not in the wrong. However, the user initially thought the author was in the wrong, so there's a conflict. Need to weigh personal choice against honoring family legacy versus personal identity and mental health.\n"
