My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for changing their name from a male name given by their parents to a nickname-based name. The person's parents named them after their grandfather, but the name is a short male name with no girly nickname. The person has been teased in school and wants to change both their first and last name to a nickname that friends use. Their mom doesn't approve and thinks it's forsaking the grandfather's memory.\n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. I need to decide between A (author is wrong) or B (not wrong). \n\nFirst, consider autonomy. People have the right to choose their names, especially if it's causing them distress. The author's name has been a source of bullying, which is significant. Changing a name is a personal choice, and the author is using their chosen nickname which they've used socially for years. The fianc\u00e9 uses that name too, so it's part of their identity now. \n\nOn the other hand, the parents feel it's disrespectful to the grandfather. But the author isn't erasing their grandfather; they're choosing a different name. The parents' disapproval is a personal opinion, but the author's well-being and self-identity might take priority. Also, the author is an adult, so they have the legal right to change their name. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the site generally supports people's right to make adult decisions about their lives, especially regarding personal identity and well-being. The mother's disapproval is valid, but it's not the author's responsibility to prioritize her feelings over their own. The key points are the author's right to self-identify and the impact of the name on their life. \n\nSo, the answer is B (not in the wrong). The author isn't wrong for seeking a name that better fits their identity and reduces negative experiences.\n"
