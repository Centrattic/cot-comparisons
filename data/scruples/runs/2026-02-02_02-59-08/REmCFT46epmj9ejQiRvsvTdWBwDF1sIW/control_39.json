My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person is in the wrong for changing their name. The background is that they were given a male name (like John) by their parents, honoring their grandfather. The person is a girl and feels it's a boy's name without a female version. She's been teased for it and now wants to legally change both her first and last name to a nickname based on her current last name. Her mom is upset, saying she's forsaking her grandfather's memory.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the person's perspective. They've been made fun of, which is a valid issue. Feeling that the name isn't representative of their identity, especially since there's no female version, might be a strong reason. Also, using a nickname that's accepted by friends and her fianc\u00e9 could be part of her identity. Legally changing a name is a personal choice, and while family disapproval is painful, it doesn't inherently make the person wrong.\n\nOn the other hand, the parents had their reasons, honoring her grandfather. The mom's disapproval is emotional, but the daughter's decision is about her own well-being and self-identity. The key here is whether the daughter is being disrespectful by changing the name. However, the name was given with a specific intention, but the daughter is the one living with it. The fact that she's been using the nickname for a long time suggests it's part of her identity now.\n\nI should weigh the emotional impact on the family against the daughter's personal experience. While family ties matter, the decision to change a name is personal. Unless there's a legal or ethical violation, it's more about personal autonomy. The answer likely leans towards the daughter not being in the wrong, as she's choosing her identity over her family's disapproval, which is a common conflict in such name change scenarios.\n"
