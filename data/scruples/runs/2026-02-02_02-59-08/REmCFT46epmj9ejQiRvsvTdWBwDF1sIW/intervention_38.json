My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to change their name. The author was given a male name (like John) by their parents, which they feel is causing them issues because they're a girl. They want to change both their first and last name to a nickname that's more gender-neutral or female, which their friends use. Their mom is upset, saying she won't accept the new name and thinks it's disrespecting the grandfather. The author feels that the nickname is more representative of their identity, especially since their fianc\u00e9 uses it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key factors here. Name changes are personal decisions. People often change their names for various reasons\u2014cultural, personal identity, to honor someone, or to avoid discrimination. In this case, the author is dealing with a name that's causing them social issues and isn't fitting their gender identity. The parents gave the name with a certain intention (honoring the grandfather), but the author feels it's not suitable for them now.\n\nThe mother's objection is about respecting the grandfather's memory, but the author's argument is about their own identity and comfort. There's a conflict between honoring family tradition and personal identity. In many cases, especially in modern times, individuals are encouraged to make choices that align with their true selves, even if it causes some family tension. However, there's also cultural context. In some cultures, changing a name given by parents might be seen as disrespectful. But if the culture is more individualistic, the person's right to self-identify is more emphasized.\n\nThe author is an adult, 21 and engaged, so they have the legal right to change their name. The question isn't about legality but about being in the wrong morally. The author's reasoning is that they've always used the nickname, which feels like their real name now. The fianc\u00e9 using the nickname shows that the new name is part of their established identity. The mother's disapproval is hurtful, but the author might have a valid point about their own identity and the practical issues (being teased). \n\nOn the other hand, the mother's perspective is about respecting the grandfather's memory. It's possible the grandfather's name was chosen with specific significance, and the mother feels the author is disregarding that. However, the author's choice could be a way to honor the grandfather in a different form, maybe by keeping the nickname derived from the last name. It's a balance between family legacy and personal identity.\n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the author is being disrespectful versus standing up for their identity. Since the author is using a nickname that's already been part of their identity, and the name given by parents isn't serving them well, they might not be in the wrong. The mother's feelings are valid, but the author has the right to choose their name as an adult. So the answer is probably B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
