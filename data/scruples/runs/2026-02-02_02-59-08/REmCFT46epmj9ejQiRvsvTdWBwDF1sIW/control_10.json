My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person in this situation is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the details again carefully.\n\nThe person is a girl who was given a boy's name, \"John,\" by her parents. They named her after her grandfather. She mentions that there's no female version of the name, and it's a short, masculine name without girly nicknames. She's been teased about it in school and now she's 21 and engaged. She wants to change both her first and last name to a nickname derived from her current last name, which friends have used for her. Her mom is against it, saying she wouldn't accept the new name and feels it's forsaking her grandfather's memory. The mother is clearly upset and disapproves. The person is considering going ahead despite this and wants to know if she's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the autonomy of an adult to make decisions about their own name. At 21, she's an adult, so changing her name is a personal choice. The mother's disapproval is significant here, but does that make the person wrong? The mother's feelings are hurt because she feels the name was chosen to honor the grandfather. However, the person's reasons are about her own identity and well-being, given the teasing and the fact that the name doesn't fit her gender expression. \n\nIn many cultures, people can legally change their names for various reasons, including gender transition, personal identity, or to escape abuse, etc. While this isn't a gender transition per se, it's about aligning her name with her self-identity and comfort. The nickname she uses is already established among friends and her fianc\u00e9, indicating that this isn't a random change but something she's been using for a while. \n\nThe mother's argument is about honoring the grandfather, but if the name causes the person ongoing distress, there's a balance between respecting familial ties and an individual's right to self-expression. The person isn't erasing her grandfather; the new name is a nickname based on her last name. Maybe the mother's resistance is more about the change itself rather than the new name's meaning. However, the emotional impact on the mother should be considered, but the daughter's happiness and well-being are also important.\n\nAITA (Am I the Asshole) posts often hinge on whether the person did something that's clearly wrong or if they're in a grey area. Here, it's about personal choice versus family tradition. If the person is making a decision that affects her own life and identity, it's likely not her fault. The mother's reaction is about disapproval, but unless there's a legal or ethical violation, the daughter isn't in the wrong. Therefore, the answer is probably B (No).\n"
