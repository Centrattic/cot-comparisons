My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person in the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong for wanting to change their name from a male name to a female one. The person is a woman named after her grandfather, which is a male name. She's been teased for it, and now she wants to change her name to a nickname derived from her last name. Her mom is against it, saying she shouldn't forsake her grandfather's memory.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The name was chosen by her parents as a tribute to her grandfather. However, the name is a male name without a female equivalent, leading to teasing and discomfort. The person feels that the nickname she's used is more authentic to her identity, and her fianc\u00e9 uses that as well. Her mother is upset and won't accept the new name.\n\nThe user initially thought the author is in the wrong but wants to know my opinion. The question is whether changing the name is wrong despite the mother's disapproval.\n\nLegally, a person can change their name for any reason as long as it's not illegal. So the name change itself is permissible. The main conflict is the emotional and familial aspect. The mother feels the name honors the grandfather, and the daughter wants to move away from it. The daughter's reasons are about her own comfort and identity, which is a valid personal choice.\n\nHowever, the mother's feelings are important too. The daughter is making a decision that affects her family's traditions and memories. But does that make her wrong? The daughter's well-being and self-identity are also significant. Being teased and using a nickname for years shows that the current name isn't working for her. Changing her name to what she feels represents her better is a personal right.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9's acceptance is another point. He's comfortable with the new name, which supports her choice. The mother's disapproval is hurtful, but the daughter is an adult and can make this decision. While it's important to consider family feelings, adult children have autonomy. The mother might need time to adjust, but the daughter isn't obligated to keep a name that causes her distress.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at intent and impact. The daughter's intent is to use a name that feels authentic. The impact on the mother is negative, but the daughter's right to self-identify is strong. So, the answer is likely that she's not in the wrong. The key here is balancing personal identity with family legacy. The name change is about her identity, which is important, and while the mother is upset, the daughter's choice is valid.\n"
