My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is a woman named after her grandfather with a male name, like John. She's been teased for it and now wants to legally change both her first and last names to a nickname her friends use. Her mom is upset, saying she's forsaking her grandfather's memory. The question is whether she's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I should consider her reasons. She's been made fun of, which is a valid reason to want to change her name. It's her legal right to change her name, especially since she's an adult. Her mom's disapproval is hurtful, but parents can't dictate an adult child's choices. The nickname has been her social name for years, so using it legally makes sense. She's also getting married, which might be a factor in wanting to align her name with her fianc\u00e9's. However, the grandfather connection is a family aspect. The mom feels the name honors her grandfather, but the author feels it's not a female version. Maybe the grandfather had a female equivalent, but the parents didn't use it. The author's choice to change her name could be seen as reclaiming her identity. On the other hand, the mom's feelings about honoring the grandfather are important, but they shouldn't override the author's autonomy. Since she's 21, she's legally an adult, so her decision to change her name is her right. The key points are her right to self-identify, the legal ability to change names, and the impact of her choice on her own well-being versus her mom's feelings. The mom's reaction is a personal loss, but the author isn't in the wrong for making a choice that affects her life. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
