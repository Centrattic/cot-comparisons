My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to change her name from a male name (like \"John\") to a nickname that feels more like her own. The parents gave the name in honor of the grandfather, but she's been teased for it and wants to change both her first and last name. The parents are upset, especially the mom, who thinks it's forsaking the grandfather's memory.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author's name was chosen as a tribute but isn't suitable for her as a girl. She's been bullied because of it, which is a significant issue. Changing a name is a personal decision, and many people do so for various reasons, including personal identity and comfort. However, the parents feel hurt because they see the name as honoring their own father.\n\nOn one hand, respecting family traditions and the memory of relatives is important. On the other hand, the individual's right to self-identify and choose their name is also a valid consideration. The fact that she's been using the nickname for a long time and her fianc\u00e9 uses it suggests that it's important to her identity. The teasing adds weight to her desire for change, as it affects her well-being.\n\nThe mom's reaction is about the name's significance to the family. But does that outweigh the daughter's need to feel comfortable in her own skin? In many societies, name changes are allowed if the person wants to, especially if the original name causes distress. The parents might feel disrespected, but the daughter isn't necessarily wrong for prioritizing her own identity and happiness.\n\nSo, weighing these factors, the author isn't in the wrong. She has a valid reason related to her personal experience and well-being. The parents' feelings are important, but they shouldn't override her right to choose her name. The answer should be B (No).\n"
