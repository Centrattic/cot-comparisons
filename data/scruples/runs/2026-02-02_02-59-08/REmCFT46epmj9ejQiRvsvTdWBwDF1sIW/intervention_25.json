My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for changing their name away from the one their parents gave them, which is a boy's name. The parents named them after the grandfather, but didn't use a female version. The author has been teased for it, and now they want to change both first and last names to a nickname.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. Hmm. So, the question is whether changing the name is right or wrong. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the cultural context. In many cultures, names are important family traditions. The parents intended to honor the grandfather by naming their child after him, even if it's typically a male name. Changing the name might be seen as disregarding that tradition. However, the author is facing real-life issues like being teased, which affects their well-being. \n\nAlso, the author is 21 and in a relationship where the fianc\u00e9 uses the nickname. The name they want is a nickname they've used socially, which feels more authentic to them. The mother's disapproval is strong, but does that give her the right to dictate the author's name? \n\nLegal aspects: In many places, adults can legally change their names, so the author has the right to do so. However, the emotional aspect with family is tricky. But the question is about being in the wrong morally or socially, not legally. \n\nThe mother's perspective is that it's forsaking the grandfather's memory. The author might feel that the original name doesn't fit their identity, and they have a right to self-identity. \n\nBalancing respect for family traditions versus personal identity. It's a tough balance. The author might be justified in wanting to use a name that they feel comfortable with, especially if it's been used for years. But the mother's feelings are valid too. \n\nSo, in my view, the author isn't in the wrong. They have the right to choose their name, especially if it's for their own comfort and happiness. The mother's feelings are hurt, but the author isn't obligated to keep a name that's causing them distress. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
