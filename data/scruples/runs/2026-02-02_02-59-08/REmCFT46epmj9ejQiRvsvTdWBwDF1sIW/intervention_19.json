My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for changing their name from a male name to a female one. The situation is that the parents named her after the grandfather, using a male name, and she's facing teasing because of it. She wants to change both her first and last name to a nickname that her friends use, which is based on her current last name. Her mom is upset, saying she's forsaking her grandfather's memory and disapproves.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the reasons she's giving. She mentions being teased throughout school, which is a valid issue. People should have the right to choose a name that makes them feel comfortable. Also, she's using a nickname that's already associated with her, so changing it might just formalize what's already a common usage.\n\nHer mom's reaction is about honoring the grandfather. But the argument here is whether the name change is disrespectful. The grandfather's name was given with good intentions, but if the name is causing her distress, maybe the intention is to honor him in another way. Plus, the name is a male name and she's a female, which doesn't fit well, so changing it could be about authenticity.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9 and friends already use the nickname, so it's more of her \"real\" name now. Changing it might help her feel more accepted and confident. The mother's disapproval is hurtful, but adults have the right to make decisions about their own identity, even if family members are upset. \n\nI think the key points are autonomy, well-being, and the purpose of names. Names are personal and important for self-identity. If changing her name improves her quality of life and she's consistent in using the nickname, she's not in the wrong. The mother's feelings are valid, but they shouldn't override her own needs. So, the answer should be B.\n"
