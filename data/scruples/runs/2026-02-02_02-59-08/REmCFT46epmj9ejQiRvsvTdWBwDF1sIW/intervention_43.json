My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for wanting to change her name. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is a girl who was given a boy's name, \"John,\" by her parents, who named her after her grandfather. The name doesn't have a female version, and she's been teased for it throughout school. Now that she's 21 and engaged, she wants to change both her first and last names to a nickname that her friends use and which is based on her current last name. Her mom is upset, saying she'd never accept the new name and thinks it's forsaking her grandfather's memory. The author's fianc\u00e9 uses the nickname, and she's always used it socially. The question is whether she's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I should consider the legal and personal rights aspect. In most places, adults can legally change their names without needing permission from family. So legally, she's within her rights. But the question is about being \"in the wrong,\" which is more about moral or social responsibility rather than legality.\n\nThen there's the family aspect. Her parents named her after her grandfather, and she's aware of their gesture, but they didn't use a female version. She's had a hard time with the name, being teased, which is a valid reason for wanting to change it. The mother's reaction is that it's forsaking the grandfather's memory, but the author has been using the nickname all along, which feels more like her own name now.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9's acceptance is a point in her favor. Also, the author's perspective is that the nickname is more authentic to her identity. The mother's disapproval could create family tension, but does that make the author in the wrong? It depends on how one weighs personal identity and autonomy against family ties and traditions.\n\nOn one hand, the author has a right to her own identity and to choose a name that makes her feel comfortable, especially given the history of being teased. On the other hand, her mother feels it's disrespectful to the grandfather. But the grandfather is presumably deceased, so his feelings aren't a factor. The mother's feelings are hurt, but that's a common issue in name changes. The author isn't wrong for wanting to live authentically, even if it upsets her family.\n\nI think the key points are the author's personal experience (being teased, using the nickname for years) and her legal right to change her name. The mother's disapproval is significant, but it's not a moral obligation to keep a name that causes her distress. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
