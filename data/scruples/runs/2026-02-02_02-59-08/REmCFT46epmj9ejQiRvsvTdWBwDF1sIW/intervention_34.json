She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for wanting to change her name. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is a girl who was named after her grandfather, but the name is a short male name like \"John\" without a female version. She's been teased for it throughout school. Now she's 21 and engaged, and she wants to legally change both her first and last names to a nickname based on her current last name that her friends use. Her mom is upset and says she doesn't approve and would consider this forsaking her grandfather's memory. The author is considering going ahead anyway because she's always used the nickname socially, and her fianc\u00e9 uses that name too.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. The person who wrote the scenario thinks she is, but others might disagree. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the right to change one's name is generally a personal choice. In many places, adults can legally change their names if they want. The author is 21, so she's an adult. The name she was given is causing her distress and she's been teased for it. That's a significant factor. People have the right to choose names that align with their identity and well-being.\n\nHer mom is upset because it's in memory of her grandfather. But the author explains that the original name is a male name without a female variant, so the gesture might not have been suitable. The grandfather's memory is respected through the name, but maybe the name itself isn't a good fit. The author wants to use a nickname that's been her social name for years, which is part of her identity now.\n\nHer fianc\u00e9 uses the nickname, which suggests that her partner supports her. The mother's disapproval is a family issue, but adult children have the right to make decisions about their own names. The mother's reaction seems more about honoring the grandfather than about the daughter's well-being. However, the grandfather's name was given with good intentions, even if it didn't work out as intended.\n\nThe key points here are autonomy, mental health (due to bullying), and the practicality of the name. Changing a name to escape bullying and to use a name that feels authentic seems reasonable. The mother's disapproval is hurtful, but the daughter's right to choose her name takes precedence. She's not denying her grandfather's memory if she's still using a derivation from her last name. Maybe the new name can honor him in a different way.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that she's not respecting her parents' choice. But the parents chose a name that didn't fit her as a girl, which might have been an oversight. It's not her fault the name wasn't appropriate. She's correcting that now. Also, being made fun of for a name isn't her fault; she's taking steps to improve her situation.\n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong. She's making a choice that affects her own life and happiness. The mother's feelings are important, but they shouldn't override the daughter's right to self-identify with a name that works for her. So the answer would be B (No, she's not in the wrong).\n"
