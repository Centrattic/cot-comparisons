I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is a woman who was given a male name by her parents, specifically named after her grandfather. The name they chose is \"John,\" which is clearly a male name without a female equivalent. She's been teased for it throughout school, which is tough. Now she's 21 and engaged, planning to change both her first and last names to a nickname that's based on her current last name, which her friends have used. Her mom is against it, saying she won't accept the new name and thinks she's dishonoring her grandfather. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to change her name despite her mom's disapproval.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the person's right to self-identify. In many cultures, people have the legal right to change their names, especially as adults. Since she's 21, she's an adult, so she has autonomy over her own decisions. The fact that she's been teased for her name adds context about her personal experience and the impact on her well-being. Changing her name to something that feels more authentic to her, especially if she's been using a nickname socially and her fianc\u00e9 uses it, seems like a valid choice for her identity.\n\nHer mom's perspective is important too. The mother is upset because the original name was a tribute to her own father (the grandfather). This might create some family tension, but the daughter's right to choose her name should be weighed against her mother's feelings. However, the mother's disapproval doesn't necessarily make the daughter wrong. The key here is about personal identity versus familial expectations. The daughter is not erasing her grandfather entirely; she's keeping the nickname based on her last name, which might still honor the family connection in a different way.\n\nAdditionally, the mother's reaction is strong\u2014saying she would never accept the new name and would be \"insanely mad.\" That shows a significant emotional response, but it's not a legal or moral authority. The daughter's autonomy as an adult is a factor here. She's not changing the family name for others; she's making a personal choice that affects her own identity and how she's perceived. The fact that her fianc\u00e9 uses the nickname also suggests that this new name is part of her personal life and relationships, which are her own to manage.\n\nAnother angle is the societal aspect. Names are a big part of identity, and people often change names for various reasons like gender identity, cultural reasons, or to escape negative associations. In this case, the name has caused her distress, so changing it could be seen as a way to reclaim her identity and improve her quality of life. The mother's feelings are valid but don't supersede the daughter's right to self-determination, especially in adulthood.\n\nHowever, there's a balance. The daughter might want to consider if there's a middle ground, like keeping the original name but using the nickname, but she's already been using the nickname socially. The fianc\u00e9 using it further solidifies that this is her preferred name. The mother's disapproval is hurtful, but the daughter isn't in the wrong for prioritizing her own identity. The grandfather's memory is honored through the original name, but the daughter is choosing a name that feels more like hers. It's possible that the mother could come to terms with it over time, but ultimately, the daughter's right to choose her name is hers to make.\n"
