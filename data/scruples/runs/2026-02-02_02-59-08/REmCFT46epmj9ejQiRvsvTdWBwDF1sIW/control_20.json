My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for changing their name from a male name given by parents to a nickname. The parents named her after her grandfather, but didn't use the female version. She's been teased for her name in school and now, at 21 and engaged, wants to legally change both her first and last name to the nickname. Her mom is against it and says she'd never accept the new name, thinking it's forsaking the grandfather's memory.\n\nFirst, the key points here: the person is an adult, 21, so legally they can make decisions about their own name. The parents gave a name that's male and not the female version, leading to teasing. The nickname is what friends and fianc\u00e9 use. The mother's disapproval is strong, but the person is considering changing it anyway.\n\nLegally, in most places, adults can change their names without parental approval. So from a legal standpoint, the author isn't in the wrong. Ethically, it's more about personal autonomy versus family traditions. The author has a valid reason for wanting to change the name due to ongoing issues in school and wanting to use a name that feels more authentic to them. The nickname is already widely recognized, even by her fianc\u00e9. The mother's concern is about honoring the grandfather, but the author's well-being and comfort with her own identity might outweigh that. \n\nHowever, some might argue that the mother's feelings are important, but the author's right to self-identify is a significant factor. Since she's an adult, the decision is hers to make. The fact that she's considering the nickname, which is already used, suggests it's a practical choice. The mother's disapproval is tough, but the author isn't obligated to maintain a name that causes her distress.\n\nSo, the answer is B (No, she's not in the wrong) because she's an adult making a choice that affects her own life, especially for valid reasons like reducing harassment and using a name that aligns with her identity.\n"
