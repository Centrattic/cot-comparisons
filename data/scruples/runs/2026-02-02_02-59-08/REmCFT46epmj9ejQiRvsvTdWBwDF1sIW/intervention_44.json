My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for wanting to change her name. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, she was given a male name by her parents, named after her grandfather. She mentions that the name is like \"John,\" which is a short male name without a girly nickname. She's been teased for it in school, which is tough. Now that she's 21 and engaged, she wants to change both her first and last names. The new first name is a nickname based on her current last name that friends have used. She told her mom, but her mom is upset, saying she won't accept the new name and thinks she's forsaking her grandfather's memory. The mom is mad and doesn't approve. The author is considering going ahead despite this.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong (A) or not (B). The user thinks she is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nLet me consider the factors. Legally, adults can change their names for any reason they want. So if she's over 18, it's her right. The main issue here is the family conflict. Her parents named her after her grandfather, which shows a family tradition or memory. She's changing the name, which her mom sees as disrespect. But the author argues that she's always used the nickname, so it feels more like her name now. Also, her fianc\u00e9 uses that name. The teasing is a valid point too\u2014being bullied for a name can affect someone's self-esteem.\n\nOn one hand, changing a name that was given by parents might be seen as disrespectful, especially if it's tied to family history. The mom's reaction is strong, indicating deep emotional ties. On the other hand, the author has the right to her own identity. Using a nickname that friends and fianc\u00e9 use suggests that it's her preferred name, and changing it could help her feel more comfortable and accepted. The teasing she's faced is a real issue that she shouldn't have to endure.\n\nSo, is she in the wrong? Well, ethically, she's making a choice that affects her own life. While her parents are hurt, she's not legally or morally bound to keep the name if it's causing her distress. Her right to self-identify and choose her name is important. The mom's disapproval is unfortunate, but the author has the right to make this decision. Therefore, she's not in the wrong.\n"
