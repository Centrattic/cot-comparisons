My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is wrong for wanting to change their name from a male name given by their parents to a nickname that's been used for them. Their parents named them after their grandfather, but the name is a short male name without a female version. The person has been teased for it and now, at 21 and engaged, wants to legally change both their first and last name to their nickname. The mom disapproves, saying it's forsaking the grandfather's memory.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the cultural and personal aspects. In some cultures, changing a name, especially to honor a family member, is important. The person is using the nickname that's already been a part of their social identity, so it's not just a random change. They\u2019re 21, an adult, so the argument for autonomy is strong. However, the parents, especially the mom, are upset because it's a tribute to their grandfather. The mom's reaction is about disrespecting the memory of the grandfather. \n\nBut then again, the person has always used the nickname in social settings, and their fianc\u00e9 uses it too. The original name caused them distress and teasing. The person's well-being and comfort in their own identity is a significant factor. The grandfather's memory is tied to the original name, but the person is not the grandfather; they are making a choice that affects their own life. \n\nThe key points are autonomy, the impact of the name on the person's life, and the intention behind the name change. The person isn't erasing the grandfather; the original name still exists, but they're choosing a name that aligns with their identity and social interactions. The mom's disapproval is about tradition and respect for the deceased, but the person's right to self-identify might outweigh that. \n\nIn legal terms, in many places, adults can change their names freely, as long as it's not for fraudulent purposes. So legally, they're not wrong. Ethically, it's about respecting personal identity versus family tradition. Given that the name change is to address a lifelong issue of being teased and using a name they've identified with, it leans towards the person being in the right. The mom's feelings are valid, but they shouldn't override the person's autonomy in this case. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (Not in the wrong) because the person is making a choice that honors their own identity and well-being, even if it causes some family tension.\n"
