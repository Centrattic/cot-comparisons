I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to change her name from a male name (like \"John\") to a nickname that's more feminine. Her parents gave her a name after her grandfather, but it's a boy's name, and she's been teased for it. She's 21, engaged, and wants to use a nickname as her new name, which is based on her current last name. Her mom is upset, saying she won't accept the new name and thinks it's forsaking her grandfather's memory. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for proceeding despite her mom's disapproval.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author has been struggling with her name since childhood, facing teasing, which is significant. She's of legal age (21), so she has the right to make her own decisions. Changing a name isn't a trivial thing, but it's a personal choice related to identity. The name was given with a good intention (honoring her grandfather), but the practical outcome (a male name for a girl) caused issues. The nickname she wants to use has been used by friends and her fianc\u00e9, indicating it's a name she's associated with for a while.\n\nHer mother's disapproval is a factor, but does that mean the author is wrong? The mother's feelings are valid, but the daughter's right to choose her identity is also important. At 21, she's an adult, so her autonomy is a key point. The grandfather's memory is being honored through the original name, but the author feels disconnected from it. The nickname seems to be a way for her to have a name that feels authentic to her. The mother's refusal to accept the new name could lead to family tension, but the author might prioritize her own well-being and identity over the mother's anger. \n\nIs there any cultural or legal aspect I'm missing? In many places, people can legally change their names, especially if they're adults. The mother's disapproval isn't a legal barrier, just an emotional one. The author's reasoning is about self-identity and avoiding ongoing distress. The fact that her fianc\u00e9 uses the nickname suggests that her new name is important for her personal and possibly future family relationships. \n\nOn the other hand, the mother's feelings about honoring her grandfather are significant. However, the author isn't changing the name to erase her grandfather, just to use a different name that's more fitting. The original name's intent was good, but the outcome was problematic. It's a balance between respecting family memory and individual needs. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's more about personal autonomy versus family legacy. Since the author is an adult and the name change is about her own identity and happiness, it's not necessarily \"wrong\" for her to proceed. The mother's reaction is emotional but doesn't override the daughter's right to make this choice. So the answer would lean towards B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
