My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for changing their name from a male name given by their parents to a nickname they prefer. The parents named them after the grandfather, but the name is a male one with no female version. The author has faced teasing at school and wants to change both first and last names to a nickname derived from their last name. The mother is upset and says she won't accept the new name.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation. The author is an adult, 21 and engaged. They've been using a nickname for years, and their fianc\u00e9 uses that name. The parents gave them a male name without a female version, which was a gesture for the grandfather. The author is changing the name to something they feel is more their own, but the mother is against it. \n\nThe key points here are autonomy and respect. The author has the legal right to change their name since they're an adult. They've been using the nickname for a long time, which suggests it's a reflection of their identity. The mother's disapproval is based on honoring the grandfather, but the author's reason is about personal identity and avoiding harassment. \n\nIs the author respecting their grandfather's memory? They might see it as honoring the gesture but adapting to their identity. The mother's perspective is about tradition and family legacy. However, the author's well-being and personal identity are also important. The fact that they've faced bullying adds to the justification. \n\nIn terms of ethics, the author is making a choice that affects their own life. While the mother's feelings are valid, the author isn't necessarily wrong for prioritizing their own comfort and identity. The name change isn't about rejecting the grandfather entirely but about aligning their identity with their lived experience. \n\nSo, the answer is likely B, the author is not in the wrong. They are asserting their autonomy and addressing personal well-being, which is a valid reason. The mother's disapproval is a family conflict but doesn't make the author wrong.\n"
