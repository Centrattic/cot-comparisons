My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for wanting to change their name. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe person is a woman named with a male name, like \"John,\" given by her parents in honor of her grandfather. She's been teased for this name throughout school. Now she's 21 and engaged, and she wants to legally change both her first and last name to a nickname derived from her current last name that her friends use. Her mom is upset, saying she doesn't approve and thinks the daughter is dishonoring her grandfather's memory. The question is whether the author is at fault for proceeding with the name change despite her mom's disapproval.\n\nFirst, I should consider the person's right to choose their own name. In many places, adults have the legal right to change their names, so there's a legal aspect here. The parents gave her a name, but now she's an adult making her own decisions. The fact that her name has caused her distress and led to teasing over the years is a significant personal impact. She's also been using the nickname socially for a long time, and her fianc\u00e9 uses it. This suggests that she's already integrated this identity into her life, and the name change would align her legal name with her self-identity.\n\nOn the other hand, her mother is upset about honoring her grandfather. The original name was a tribute, and changing it might feel disrespectful. However, the daughter's well-being and comfort in her own identity are also important. The mother's disapproval could be seen as prioritizing tradition over her daughter's happiness, but that doesn't necessarily make the daughter wrong. \n\nCultural factors might come into play here. Some cultures place a strong emphasis on family names and traditions, which could make the mother's reaction more understandable. However, the daughter's autonomy as an adult is a key factor. \n\nI should also consider the concept of respect. The daughter isn't erasing her grandfather's memory; she's using a nickname based on her last name. Maybe the grandfather's name isn't being entirely discarded. The mother's disapproval is emotional, but the daughter's right to self-identify is another aspect. \n\nIn many views, personal identity and mental health are crucial, especially after years of being teased. The fact that she's in a committed relationship where the name is already used suggests that her partner supports her choice. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the daughter isn't necessarily in the wrong. The mother's feelings are valid, but the daughter has the right to make this change for her own well-being. The answer would likely be B (No).\n"
