My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The person is a woman who was given a male name, \"John,\" by her parents, after her grandfather. She's been teased for it and wants to legally change her name to the nickname her friends use, which is based on her last name. Her mom is upset, thinking she's dishonoring her grandfather.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rights of individuals to choose their names. In many places, people can legally change their names for personal reasons, especially if it's causing them distress. The person is changing it to something that feels more authentic to her, which is important for self-identity and well-being. The fact that she's been mocked for her name suggests that it's affected her negatively, so changing it could help her feel more comfortable.\n\nHer mother's perspective is about honoring the grandfather's memory. But the name was given as a male name, and the person is female, so the name doesn't fit. The mother's disapproval is emotional, but the individual has the right to make decisions about her own identity. The fianc\u00e9 accepts the new name, which supports her choice.\n\nHowever, there's also the aspect of family relationships. The mother might feel hurt or disrespected. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If she's making a personal choice that affects her life, and the mother's feelings are a consequence rather than a wrongdoing, then she might not be in the wrong. The key points are autonomy, personal identity, and the legal right to change one's name. The mother's disapproval is valid in terms of emotions, but doesn't necessarily make the author wrong. So the answer is B.\n"
