My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to change their name from a male name (like \"John\") to a female nickname. The parents named them after the grandfather, and the author feels the name isn't suitable as a girl's name. They've been teased and want to use a nickname as their legal name now. The mother is upset, thinking it disrespects the grandfather.\n\nFirst, name changes are personal. People often change names for various reasons\u2014gender identity, cultural reasons, personal preference. The author mentions using the nickname socially for a long time, so it's become their identity. The fianc\u00e9 uses it too, which adds to the personal connection. The mother's disapproval is hurtful, but does that make the author wrong?\n\nThe key points: the name was never a good fit, causing distress and social issues. The author is seeking to align their legal name with how they've lived their life. The grandfather's memory is important, but the name was given with a male name, which the author feels isn't appropriate. The mother's reaction is about honoring the grandfather, but the author's well-being and self-identity might take precedence. \n\nLegally, changing a name is a personal right in many places, especially when it's to correct a mismatch. If the name is causing harm, the author is within their rights to change it. The mother's feelings are valid, but the decision is the author's to make. So the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
