My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for changing their name from a male name given by their parents to a nickname they prefer. The parents named them after the grandfather, but the name is a boy's name with no girly nicknames, leading to teasing. Now they're 21, engaged, and want to legally change their name to the nickname. The mom is upset and says she won't accept it, but the author feels it's more their name now.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The name was given with a gesture (honoring the grandfather), but the author faces ongoing issues due to the name. At 21, they have autonomy over their own name. The parent's disapproval is a factor, but the author's well-being and comfort are also important. Legally, changing one's name is possible, and many people do it for personal reasons. The fact that friends and the fianc\u00e9 use the nickname suggests it's a meaningful identity for the author. The parent's argument about forsaking the grandfather's memory might be emotional, but the author's choice to honor the gesture in their own way could be valid. The main conflict is between the parent's feelings and the author's autonomy and comfort. Most likely, the answer leans towards the author not being in the wrong since they're making a personal choice affecting their own life, especially with significant life steps like engagement.\n"
