My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the person is in the wrong for changing their name from a male name given by their parents to a nickname they've used for years. The parents are upset because it's a name after the grandfather, and the mother doesn't approve.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the cultural and personal aspects. In many cultures, names can carry a lot of weight, especially if they're family names. The parents named her after the grandfather, which shows some tradition or respect. But she's an adult now, and she's facing issues like being teased for the name. That's a valid reason to want to change it, especially since she's been using a nickname all along. \n\nShe's 21 and engaged, so the change affects her personal life and marriage. Her fianc\u00e9 uses the nickname, which suggests it's a name she's comfortable with and that's part of her current identity. The mother's disapproval is strong, but once someone is an adult, they have the legal right to change their name. The mother's emotional reaction is understandable, but it's not about being right or wrong legally. \n\nHowever, the question is about whether she's in the wrong morally or ethically. The key points are her reasons for changing the name: avoiding bullying, personal identity, and using a nickname she's been known by. These reasons seem legitimate. The parents' feelings are hurt, but she's making a choice that affects her life. \n\nI think she's not in the wrong because she's prioritizing her own well-being and identity. While it's important to respect family feelings, an adult has the right to make such personal decisions. The mother's disapproval is painful, but it's part of the situation when making a significant personal change. The answer would be B (No).\n"
