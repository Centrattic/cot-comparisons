My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person is in the wrong for changing their name. The situation is that she was given a male name (like John) by her parents, which they named after her grandfather. She's being teased for it and wants to change her first and last name to a nickname her friends use. Her mom disapproves and says she's forsaking her grandfather's memory.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the reasons she's changing her name. She's been made fun of in school, which is a valid reason for wanting to change something that affects her well-being. Also, she's using a nickname that's already associated with her, so it's not like she's making it up out of nowhere. Her fianc\u00e9 uses that nickname too, which suggests others are already using it as her name. \n\nHer parents named her after her grandfather, which is a meaningful gesture, but the problem is the name doesn't have a female version. So maybe the parents didn't consider gender differences when choosing the name. The mother's reaction is about honoring the grandfather, but the daughter's experience with the name is causing her distress. \n\nIn terms of rights, in many places, people can legally change their names, especially as adults. So if she's 21, she has the legal right to do so. The question is more about whether she's in the wrong morally or ethically, not legally. \n\nHer mom's disapproval is a factor, but the daughter's autonomy and happiness are also important. The nickname she's using is already known to her friends and fianc\u00e9, so changing her legal name to that could align her legal identity with how she's been known socially. \n\nI think the key points are her well-being, the fact that the nickname is already established, and her legal right to change her name. The mother's feelings are valid, but the daughter's right to choose her own identity should take precedence. So the answer would be B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
