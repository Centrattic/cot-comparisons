My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to change their name. The situation is that the author was given a male name by their parents, which is a direct reference to their grandfather. The parents didn't use the female version, so the name is something like \"John\" which is short and doesn't have a girly nickname. The author has been teased for it, and now at 21 and engaged, wants to legally change both their first and last names to a nickname that friends use. The mom is against it, saying it's forsaking the grandfather's memory, and the author is considering going ahead despite that.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are autonomy over one's name, family tradition, and the impact on relationships. In many cultures, people have the right to change their names, especially if it's causing them distress. The author mentions being teased, which is a valid reason for wanting to change. The nickname is what they've used socially for a long time, so it's part of their identity now. However, the parents are upset because it's a family name honoring the grandfather. \n\nBut the parents named the author with a male name despite it being a girl's name, which might have been a mistake. The lack of a female version could be an oversight. The author is now seeking to align their legal name with how they've been known for years. The fianc\u00e9 uses the nickname, which supports the idea that this is a natural progression. The mother's disapproval is hurtful, but the author is an adult, so they have the legal right to change their name. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for going ahead despite the mother's disapproval. Since the author is over 18, they have the autonomy to make this decision. The name change is about their own identity and well-being, which is a valid reason. The mother's feelings are important, but the author's happiness and comfort should take precedence. So, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
