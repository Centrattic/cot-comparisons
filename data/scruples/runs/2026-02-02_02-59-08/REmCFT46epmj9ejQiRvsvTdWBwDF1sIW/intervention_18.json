My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for changing their name from a male name (like John) to a nickname based on their last name. The parents named them after their grandpa, a male name with no female version. The author has been teased for it, and now wants to change both first and last names. The mom is upset, saying she won't accept the new name and feels the author is dishonoring her grandfather.\n\nThe user initially thought the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. I need to decide A or B.\n\nFirst, the author's reasoning: they've always used a nickname, friends and fianc\u00e9 use it, and they want to use it as their official name. They mention being teased, which is a valid reason for wanting to change. The parents are upset because they feel it's a betrayal of their grandpa's memory. \n\nFrom a rights perspective, in many places, adults can legally change their names without their parents' permission. So the author has a right to choose their own name. The parents' feelings are important, but they're not the ones living with the name. The author's desire for a name that feels authentic to them and aligns with their identity (especially since they're a woman with a male name) is significant. Also, the fianc\u00e9 using the new name suggests it's part of their personal life and relationships outside the family.\n\nHowever, the parents' perspective is about family legacy and respect for the grandfather. They might feel the name is a tribute and changing it severs that connection. But the author isn't changing the grandpa's name; they're choosing a name that fits their identity better. The fact that the original name was a male name with no female version complicates things. The parents could have chosen a different name, but they didn't, and now the author is taking responsibility for their own identity.\n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They have a right to self-identify with a name that works for them, especially given the social challenges they've faced. The parents' disapproval is hurtful, but it's their feelings, not the author's rights. So the answer is B.\n"
