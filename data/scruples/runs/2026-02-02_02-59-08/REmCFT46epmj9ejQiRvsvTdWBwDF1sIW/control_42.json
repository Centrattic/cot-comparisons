My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for changing their name. The name was given by parents after their grandfather, but it's a male name that doesn't have a female version. The person has been teased for it and now wants to change both their first and last names to a nickname derived from their current last name. Their mom is against it, saying she won't accept the new name and thinks they're forsaking their grandfather's memory. The fianc\u00e9 uses the nickname.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The name was given with a specific gesture (honoring the grandfather), but it's a male name for a female. The person has faced bullying because of it, which is a significant issue. At 21, they're an adult, so they have the legal right to change their name. The mother's disapproval is strong, but the person feels the nickname is their true identity now.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the main factors are often respect for family, personal autonomy, and the impact on relationships. The person is making a choice that affects their own identity and well-being. While the mother's feelings are valid, the individual's right to self-identify is important, especially after years of being teased. The fact that the fianc\u00e9 uses the nickname suggests social acceptance. However, the mother's stance might cause family tension. \n\nBut the question is if the author is in the wrong. Since the person is an adult and the name change is for their own well-being and self-identity, it's more about their autonomy. The mother's disapproval is hurtful, but the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for prioritizing their needs. The name was a cultural or familial choice that didn't fit, leading to ongoing issues. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
