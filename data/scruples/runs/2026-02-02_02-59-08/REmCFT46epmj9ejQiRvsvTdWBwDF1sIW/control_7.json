My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wants to change their name is in the wrong. The situation is that she was given a male name by her parents, after her grandfather. She's been teased for it, and now she wants to legally change her name to a nickname derived from her last name. Her mom is upset and says she's forsaking her grandfather's memory.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rights of an individual to change their name. In most places, people can legally change their name if they want, as long as it's not for fraudulent purposes. So maybe that's a point in her favor. Then there's the emotional aspect. She's been made fun of, which is significant. Using a nickname that feels more like \"her\" name makes sense for her identity. Her fianc\u00e9 uses that name, which shows she's comfortable with it and others recognize it.\n\nOn the other hand, her parents chose the name with the intention of honoring her grandfather. She mentions the name is a short, male name without a girly nickname. The mother's disapproval is strong, but does that make the daughter wrong? The mother's feelings are hurt, but does the daughter have the right to prioritize her own well-being and identity over her parents' wishes here? \n\nIt's a common dilemma where individual autonomy clashes with family tradition. Legally, she's allowed to change her name. Emotionally, she's dealing with years of teasing and wanting to use a name that aligns with her sense of self. The mother's reaction is about feeling disrespected towards her grandfather, but the daughter's decision is more about her own identity and comfort. \n\nI think the answer leans towards her not being in the wrong. She's making a choice that's important for her self-image and happiness, even if it upsets her parents. The mother's feelings are valid, but the daughter's right to self-determination in her name is significant. So the answer is B (No, she's not in the wrong).\n"
