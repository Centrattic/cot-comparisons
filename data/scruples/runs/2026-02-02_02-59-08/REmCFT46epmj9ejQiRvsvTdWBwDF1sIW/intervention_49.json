My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for changing their name from a male name given by their parents to a nickname they've used. The parents didn't give the female version of the grandfather's name, which led to the name being a short, male name without a girly nickname. The author has faced teasing at school and now wants to legally change both first and last names. The mother is upset and thinks it's forsaking the grandfather's memory. The author uses the nickname socially and the fianc\u00e9 uses it too.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's perspective. They were given a name that doesn't fit their gender, leading to lifelong teasing. Using a nickname that friends recognize makes sense for them to feel more comfortable. Changing the name to this nickname could help with self-identity and reduce the negative experiences they've had. They're an adult, 21, so they have the legal right to change their name, right? That's a key point\u2014autonomy over one's name.\n\nOn the other hand, the parents wanted to honor the grandfather by naming them after him. The mother feels it's disrespectful to change the name, which is about family tradition and respect for ancestors. The conflict here is between personal identity and family legacy. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the mother's feelings are hurt, but the author is an adult and has the right to choose their own name. The name change is for their well-being and happiness. Even though it might hurt the mother's feelings, it's not necessarily wrong. People change names for various reasons, like gender identity or personal preference. The author isn't doing anything illegal or unethical. The mother's disapproval is valid, but the author's right to self-determination is also important. \n\nSo the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the author is making a choice that affects their own life and happiness, and they're not hurting anyone else. The mother's feelings are a consideration, but not a justification for the author being wrong.\n"
