My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong for wanting to change her name. The situation is that she was named after her grandfather with a male name, which she feels is being made fun of. She wants to change both her first and last name to a nickname derived from her last name that her friends use.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The name given by parents was a male name, which she didn't choose. She's been teased for it, and now she's 21 and wants to change it for her engagement. Her mother is upset, saying she's forsaking her grandfather's memory. The question is whether she's in the wrong for proceeding despite her mother's disapproval.\n\nIn terms of autonomy, most people believe that adults have the right to make decisions about their own names, especially if it affects their well-being. The name was given by her parents, but she's now an adult, so changing it isn't necessarily disrespectful. The mother's argument is about honoring the grandfather, but the person is using the nickname as her name, which might be a way to honor the grandfather's memory in a different form. Also, the fact that her fianc\u00e9 and friends already use the nickname suggests it's been accepted in her social circles, which could support her decision. However, the mother's feelings are hurt, which is a valid concern. But ultimately, the right to choose one's name often takes precedence over family disapproval. So the answer is likely B (not in the wrong).\n"
