My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about changing their name from a male name given by their parents to a female nickname they've used all along. The parents disapprove because it's a name that was originally their grandfather's and they think it's forsaking his memory.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The person was given a traditionally male name by their parents, which they've been teased for. They've used a nickname for a long time, and now they want to legally change their name to that nickname. Their mother is upset and says she won't accept it. The person is 21 and engaged, so they're an adult now with the legal right to make this decision.\n\nFrom a rights perspective, adults can legally change their names without needing permission from family. So the author isn't breaking any laws here. The parents' disapproval is understandable, especially since they named the person after a grandparent. But the author feels the nickname is more aligned with their identity and how others have known them for years. The fianc\u00e9 using the nickname shows acceptance in their personal life.\n\nThe main question is whether the author is in the wrong for proceeding despite the mother's disapproval. The answer would hinge on personal autonomy versus family tradition. The author isn't wrong for wanting to use a name that feels right to them, especially after being teased for their given name. However, the conflict arises from the mother's feelings about honoring the grandfather. But since the author is an adult, they have the right to make this choice even if it upsets their parents.\n\nI should also consider if there's any cultural or family context that might make this more complicated, but the post doesn't mention that. The key factors are the legal right to change names, the author's comfort and identity, and the long-term use of the nickname. The mother's feelings are valid, but the author isn't obligated to prioritize them over their own well-being. So the answer would be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
