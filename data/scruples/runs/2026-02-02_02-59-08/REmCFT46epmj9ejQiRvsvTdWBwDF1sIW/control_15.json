My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about changing her name from a traditionally male name (like John) to a nickname that feels more like her own. Her parents gave her the name after her grandfather, but she's been teased for it and wants to change both her first and last name. Her mom is upset and says she'll never accept the new name, thinking it's forsaking her grandfather's memory.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The person is an adult, 21, so she's legally allowed to make decisions about her own name. She's been using a nickname since childhood, which her friends and fianc\u00e9 use. The main conflict is with her mother's disapproval because of the grandfather's name. \n\nChanging one's name is a personal choice, especially when it affects self-esteem and social interactions. The parents named her after the grandfather, which is a common practice, but they didn't adjust it to a female version. That might have caused the issue. The woman has been teased, which adds to her motivation to change. \n\nHer mother's stance is about respecting the grandfather's memory, but the daughter's perspective is that the name doesn't feel like hers. The fianc\u00e9 and friends using the nickname show that she's been known by that name for a long time. \n\nIs she in the wrong? Well, she's an adult, so she has autonomy. The mother's feelings are valid, but the daughter's right to choose her name is also important. It's a conflict between honoring family tradition and personal identity. \n\nI think the answer is B, she's not in the wrong. She's making a choice that's important for her well-being and identity. The mother's disapproval is unfortunate, but the daughter isn't the one at fault here. The key is that the name change is her decision as an adult, and she's not necessarily disrespecting the grandfather by changing it, especially if she still honors him in other ways.\n"
