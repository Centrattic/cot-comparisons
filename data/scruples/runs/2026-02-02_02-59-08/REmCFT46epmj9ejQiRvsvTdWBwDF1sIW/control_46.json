My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this situation. The user is asking if the person who wants to change their name is in the wrong. Let's break down the details.\n\nThe person is a girl named after their grandfather with a male name, like \"John.\" They've been teased at school and now they want to change their first and last name to a nickname that their friends use, which is based on their current last name. Their mom is against it, saying she won't accept the new name and thinks it's forsaking the grandfather's memory.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the individual's rights to choose their name. In many places, adults can legally change their names for any reason. So, if the person is 21 and making their own decisions, they have that right. The teasing they experienced is a valid concern; being bullied or made fun of for one's name can affect self-esteem and mental health.\n\nThen, the relationship with their parents. The mom is upset and doesn't support the change. It's important to respect family feelings, but the individual also has the autonomy to make personal choices. The parents gave the name with a certain intention, but the person is now choosing to take control of their identity. That shouldn't be seen as disrespectful just because it diverges from the original name. The grandfather's memory could still be honored in other ways besides keeping the name.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9 using the nickname might indicate that the nickname is a significant part of their identity now. Consistency in how they are known by friends and family (though the mom isn't on board) suggests that the nickname is more comfortable for them. \n\nHowever, there's a balance between personal autonomy and family relationships. The person might need to consider how this change affects their relationship with their mom. But ultimately, the decision to change one's name is a personal choice. The mom's disapproval doesn't make the person wrong. \n\nSo, putting it all together: the individual has the right to change their name for personal reasons, especially if it improves their well-being. The parents' feelings are important, but the person isn't in the wrong for prioritizing their own identity and comfort.\n"
