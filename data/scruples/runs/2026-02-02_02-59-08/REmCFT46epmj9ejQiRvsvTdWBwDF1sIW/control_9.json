My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person in this situation is in the wrong for changing their name. Let me start by understanding the details.\n\nThe person is a girl who was given a male name, \"John,\" by her parents, named after her grandfather. The name doesn't have a female equivalent and is short, leading to her being teased in school. Now she's 21 and engaged, planning to change both her first and last names. The nickname she's using is based on her current last name, which her friends have used. Her mom is upset, saying she doesn't approve and thinks she's dishonoring her grandfather. The question is whether the author is at fault for going through with the name change despite her mom's disapproval.\n\nFirst, I should consider the person's reasons. She's been teased for her name, which can have a significant impact on self-esteem and social interactions. Choosing a name that aligns with her gender identity and personal comfort is important for her well-being. At 21, she's an adult, so the decision to change her name is her own. Her mother's disapproval is a family issue, but that doesn't necessarily mean the person is wrong to proceed.\n\nHowever, the mother's perspective is about honoring her grandfather. There might be cultural or familial traditions involved. The mother might feel that changing the name disrespects the grandfather's memory. But the person argues that the nickname is more representative of her identity and is already widely used. \n\nI should think about autonomy versus family expectations. In many societies, adults have the right to choose their names, especially if it's for their comfort and identity. The mother's feelings are valid, but they shouldn't override the adult child's choice. The fact that her fianc\u00e9 uses the nickname also shows that it's accepted in her personal life.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe there's a way to honor the grandfather while changing the name, like keeping part of the original name or incorporating it into the new name. But the question is about whether she's in the wrong for not doing so. Since the original name was a male name with no female version, perhaps there wasn't a suitable alternative provided by the parents, so she's making a choice that better fits her identity.\n\nIn conclusion, the person's actions seem more about her personal identity and well-being, which is a valid reason to change a name, even if it upsets family members. Therefore, she's not in the wrong.\n"
