My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this AITA question. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for wanting to change their name from a male name (like John) to a nickname that's more feminine. Their parents named them after their grandfather, which they appreciate the gesture but the name doesn't have a female equivalent. They've been teased about it in school, and now they're 21 and engaged. They want to change both their first and last name to this nickname that friends use. Their mom is upset, saying she won't accept the new name and thinks they're forsaking their grandfather's memory.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the person's reasons. They've been made fun of, which is a valid reason for wanting a change. They've used the nickname socially for a long time, so it feels more like their identity now. Their fianc\u00e9 uses that name too, indicating it's part of their personal identity. At 21, they're an adult and have the legal right to change their name. \n\nOn the other hand, the mother feels it's a rejection of her father's memory. But the user mentioned their parents didn't provide a female version of the name, which could have been a way to honor the grandfather without giving the person a name that doesn't fit their identity. The original name being a male name with no girly nicknames might have been an oversight by the parents. \n\nThe key points here are autonomy and respect. The person has every right to choose their name as an adult. While the mother's feelings are important, the individual's well-being and comfort in their own name should take precedence. The fact that the nickname is already widely used by friends and the fianc\u00e9 shows that it's been accepted in their social circle, which supports the person's choice. \n\nThe mother's disapproval is hurtful, but the person isn't wrong for prioritizing their own identity and happiness. They're not disrespecting the grandfather entirely; they acknowledge the gesture but are choosing a name that feels more authentic to them. There's no indication they're trying to erase the grandfather's memory, just choosing a name that better fits their gender identity and social interactions. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They have a valid reason to change their name for personal comfort and identity, and as an adult, they're within their rights to do so despite family disapproval.\n"
