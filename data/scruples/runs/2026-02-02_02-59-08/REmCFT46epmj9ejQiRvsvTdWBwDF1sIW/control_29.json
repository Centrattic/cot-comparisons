My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the situation is in the wrong for wanting to change their name from a male name given by their parents to a female nickname that they've used socially. The parents named them after the grandfather, a male name. The person feels that the name has been a source of teasing and they want to use a nickname as their legal name now. Their mom is upset and says she won't accept the new name.\n\nHmm. So, the question is whether changing the name is in the wrong. First, I need to consider the person's rights. In many places, adults can legally change their names for any reason. So the person has the legal right to do this. They mention they're 21 and engaged, so they're an adult. Their parents gave them the name, but they feel it's not fitting and have been bullied because of it. The nickname is used by friends and even the fianc\u00e9, so it's part of their identity now.\n\nThe parents are upset because they think it's forsaking the grandfather's memory. But the person's argument is that the name doesn't fit their gender identity or social identity, leading to teasing. They want to use a name that feels authentic to them. \n\nOn one hand, the parents have a sentimental reason, but on the other, the person has the right to self-identify. The parents' disapproval is emotional, but does that make the person in the wrong? Probably not. The person is asserting their identity, which is a valid reason. Also, the name change is for both first and last name, which is their choice as an adult. The mother's disapproval is hurtful, but the person isn't wrong for making this choice. So the answer would be B, they're not in the wrong.\n"
