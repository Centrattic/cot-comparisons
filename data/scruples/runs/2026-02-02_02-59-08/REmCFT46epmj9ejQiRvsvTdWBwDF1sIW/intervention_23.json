My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to change their name. The author was given a male name by her parents, which they feel is causing them issues. They want to change both their first and last name to a nickname that friends use. The parents disapprove, especially the mom, and the author is considering going ahead despite that.\n\nHmm. First, I need to consider the cultural and personal aspects. In many cultures, names hold significant family and heritage importance. The parents named her after her grandfather, which was a meaningful gesture. Changing the name could be seen as disregarding that legacy. But then again, the author has always used a nickname, which is different from the given name. It's about personal identity and how others perceive her. Being teased at school adds another layer; maybe the name change is for her well-being.\n\nThe author is 21 and engaged, so it's her adult decision. Parents might feel hurt, but they can't control their adult child's choices. However, the mother's reaction is strong\u2014saying she won't accept the new name and would be angry. Is the author being disrespectful, or is she asserting her autonomy?\n\nLegally, she can change her name if she wants. The question is more about moral wrong. If changing the name is necessary for her happiness and social identity, maybe she's not in the wrong. But if the name has deep family meaning and she's dismissing that without respect, maybe she is. However, she's using a nickname that friends have always used, which suggests it's been part of her identity for a while. The fianc\u00e9 uses the nickname too, indicating support.\n\nI think the key points are her personal well-being, the long-term use of the nickname, and the parents' right to disapprove versus her autonomy. The parents might feel hurt, but the author has the right to choose her name as an adult. So maybe she's not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
