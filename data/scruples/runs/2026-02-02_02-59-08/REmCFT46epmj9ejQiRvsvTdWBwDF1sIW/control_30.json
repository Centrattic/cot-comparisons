My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wants to change their name is in the wrong. The situation is that the person was given a male name by their parents, which is a family name after their grandfather. They've been teased for it, and now they want to legally change both their first and last name to a nickname that's more feminine. Their mom is upset and says she won't accept the new name. The fianc\u00e9 uses the nickname already.\n\nSo, first, the main points are: the person wants to change their name to something that feels more like theirs, especially since the original name is a male name they don't like. They mention being teased, which is a valid emotional impact. The parents gave the name for a reason (honoring grandpa), but the person feels it's not fitting. The fianc\u00e9 supports the nickname, so there's personal validation there. The mother's disapproval is about forsaking the grandfather's memory, but the person is choosing a nickname that's already used by friends.\n\nLegally, in most places, you can change your name for any reason as long as it's not illegal. So the right to change is there. The ethical question is whether the person is wrong for prioritizing their own identity and comfort over the parents' wishes. The parents might feel hurt, but the person is an adult and has the right to make decisions about their own identity. The fact that the name has caused them distress and they have a nickname that's been accepted socially makes the case stronger for them. The mother's disapproval is hurtful, but the person isn't necessarily in the wrong for wanting to change. The answer is likely B (No).\n"
