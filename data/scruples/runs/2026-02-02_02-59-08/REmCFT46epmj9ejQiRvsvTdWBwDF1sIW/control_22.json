My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for changing their name from a male name given by their parents, who named them after their grandfather. The name was a male name without a female equivalent, leading to teasing. They want to change both their first and last name to a nickname derived from their current last name. Their mom disapproves and says she won't accept the new name, feeling it forsakes the grandfather's memory.\n\nFirst, the right to change one's name is a personal choice, legally allowed in most places. The individual's identity and comfort are important. The name was given with a specific intention (honoring the grandfather), but the person has been affected negatively by it. They've used the nickname socially for a long time, which makes it feel more authentic to them now. The fianc\u00e9 uses the nickname too, suggesting social acceptance.\n\nThe mother's disapproval is a family conflict, but the person is 21 and an adult. While respecting family feelings is important, the individual has the right to make decisions about their own identity. The core issue is about personal identity versus honoring family tradition. Since the person is changing for their own well-being and it's a legal choice, they're not in the wrong. The answer is B.\n"
