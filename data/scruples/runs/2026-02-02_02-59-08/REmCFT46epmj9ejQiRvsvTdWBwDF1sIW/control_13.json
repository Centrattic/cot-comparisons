My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for changing their name from a male name to a female one. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author was named after her grandfather, but the name is a short boy's name like \"John\" with no girly nickname. She's been teased for it and now wants to legally change her name to a nickname derived from her last name, which her friends have used. Her mom is upset and says she'll never accept the new name, thinking it's forsaking the grandfather's memory.\n\nHmm, the key points here are her right to choose her name versus her parents' feelings. Legally, in most places, adults can change their names without needing permission. The parents gave her the name, but once someone is an adult, they have autonomy over their identity. The mother's reaction is emotional, linking the name to her grandfather, but the author has valid reasons for wanting to change it due to bullying and personal identity.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9 uses the nickname, friends use it, so it's already her known name. Changing the legal name to match that makes sense. The mother's disapproval is a problem, but the author isn't obligated to keep a name that's caused her distress. So, she's not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
