My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for wanting to change her name. The situation is that her parents named her after her grandfather with a male name, but she's a girl. It's causing her to be teased, so she wants to change both her first and last name to a nickname that's been used by friends and her fianc\u00e9. Her mom is upset and says she won't accept the new name, which is causing tension.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the reasons behind the name change. The person mentions being teased in school, which is a valid reason for wanting to change a name. Identity and how one is perceived can significantly affect self-esteem, especially if the name leads to ongoing harassment or discomfort. The fact that she's been using the nickname socially and her fianc\u00e9 uses it too suggests that this change is a reflection of her true identity.\n\nOn the other hand, the parents gave her the name in honor of her grandfather, which is a meaningful gesture. The mother's reaction is about feeling that the name change is forsaking the grandfather's memory. This touches on family traditions and the emotional significance of names. However, the person is now an adult, and the decision to change her name is her right. While the mother's feelings are valid, the daughter's autonomy and well-being are also important.\n\nThe key here is balancing respect for family legacy with personal identity. The daughter isn't changing the name to disrespect her grandfather; she's doing it for her own comfort and to align with how she's been known. The mother's disapproval is hurtful, but the daughter isn't in the wrong for prioritizing her own needs now that she's an adult. The father's opinion isn't mentioned, so maybe that's another angle, but the main conflict is with the mother.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the daughter didn't choose the name; her parents did. The name is causing her ongoing issues, and she's taking steps to address that. While it's important to show respect to her parents' intentions, she's not obligated to suffer discomfort or mockery because of a name chosen before her time. The decision to change her name is a personal choice, and as an adult, she has the right to make that decision, even if it causes some family tension.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong. Her choice to change her name to better align with her identity and reduce personal distress is a valid and reasonable decision, even if it upsets her mother.\n"
