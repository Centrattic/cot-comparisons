I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong for wanting to change their name. The person was given a male name by their parents, named after the grandfather, but they've used a nickname all their life and now want to legally change both their first and last names. Their mom is upset, thinking it's forsaking the grandfather's memory.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The original name is a short male name, \"John,\" which the person has been teased for. They've used a nickname socially for a long time, and their fianc\u00e9 uses that nickname. The parents chose a male name despite the person being female, so maybe there was a cultural or family tradition that didn't account for a female name variant. The person is 21 and engaged, so they're legally an adult now. \n\nChanging a name is a personal choice, and in many jurisdictions, adults can change their names for any reason. The mother's disapproval is emotional, feeling it's disrespecting the grandfather. But the person is dealing with the consequences of the name they were given, like bullying. The nickname they want to use as their legal name is based on their current last name, so it's not entirely unrelated. \n\nThe user is asking if the person is in the wrong. The possible angles are autonomy versus respect for family. On one hand, the person has the right to choose their name as an adult. On the other, the parents had their own reasons, and the mother is hurt. But the person's well-being and identity are important. The fact that they've used the nickname for a long time and it's part of their identity now might tip the scales. The mother's reaction is about holding onto tradition, but the person is choosing their own path. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the focus is usually on whether the person did something wrong, not just if someone else is upset. Since the person is an adult, making a legal name change is their right. The mother's disapproval is significant but doesn't necessarily make the person wrong. The person is addressing their own needs and happiness, which is often considered a valid reason. So the answer is probably B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
