My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to change their name from a traditionally male name (like John) to a nickname that their friends use. The parents are upset because they named them after their grandfather and disapprove of the change. The author is 21 and engaged, so they're an adult now.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The name was given by the parents, but the author has always been uncomfortable with it. They've been teased at school, which is a valid reason for wanting to change it. The author is going by a nickname that's more gender-neutral or female-sounding, which aligns better with their identity. The fianc\u00e9 uses the nickname, so it's part of their personal identity now. The parents feel the name is a tribute to their grandfather and are upset that the author wants to change it. \n\nNow, the ethical dilemma here is balancing respect for the parents' intentions versus the individual's right to self-identify. Legally, adults can change their names, so the author isn't breaking any laws. Emotionally, the parents are hurt because they feel the name is a connection to their grandfather. But the author is also trying to live authentically. \n\nIs the author wrong for choosing their own name? I think not. The name is a personal choice, especially when it affects their well-being and how they're perceived. The parents' disapproval is a family issue, but the author has the right to make decisions about their identity. The fact that they're being teased and the name doesn't fit their gender presentation adds weight to their decision. \n\nI should also consider cultural or family values. If the family highly values ancestral names, the conflict is more about tradition vs. individual choice. But since the author is an adult, they have the autonomy to make this choice, even if it upsets their parents. The parents' disapproval doesn't make the author wrong. \n\nSo the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong. They're prioritizing their own comfort and identity, which is valid. The parents' feelings are important, but the author's right to self-identify is a stronger ethical consideration here.\n"
