My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for changing their name from a male name (like John) to a female nickname. The key points here are the reasons given for the name change. The author mentions being teased in school and wanting a name that feels more like theirs, especially since their fianc\u00e9 uses the nickname. Their mom is upset because the original name was after the grandfather, and she doesn't approve.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the autonomy a person has over their own name. In many places, especially in Western societies, individuals have the legal right to change their name without others' approval. That's a strong point in the author's favor. The fact that they've been using the nickname socially and even their fianc\u00e9 uses it suggests that this is an identity they've embraced for a long time. The emotional impact of being teased is also significant; no one should have to endure ridicule for their name if they can change it.\n\nOn the other hand, the mom's perspective is about honoring the grandfather. The name was chosen with a specific intention, and the daughter changing it might feel like a rejection of that legacy. But is that a valid reason to not allow the name change? The author isn't erasing the grandfather entirely; the original name is still their legal name. The new name is a nickname derived from their last name, which might not be directly related to the grandfather's name. The mother's disapproval is hurtful, but does it make the author wrong?\n\nAlso, the author is 21 and engaged, indicating they're an adult making a personal choice. While family opinions matter, the decision to change one's name is a personal one. The mother's refusal to accept the new name is her choice, but the author isn't obligated to get her approval. The main question is whether the author is in the wrong for prioritizing their own comfort and identity over the family's expectations.\n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. They have the right to choose a name that makes them feel comfortable and true to themselves. The mother's feelings are valid, but they don't override the author's autonomy. So the answer should be B.\n"
