My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the person in the given situation is in the wrong for changing their name from a male name (like John) to a nickname that's more gender-appropriate, especially since their parents named them after their grandfather. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the person is 21 and engaged, so they're an adult. They've been using a nickname since school, which their friends use. Their parents didn't use the female version of the grandfather's name, leading to a name that's clearly male and not fitting for them. The parents are upset because they want to honor the grandfather, but the person feels the nickname is more authentic and their fianc\u00e9 uses it too.\n\nIn many cultures, adults have the legal right to change their names. The original name was given by parents, but as an adult, the individual might have different needs, especially regarding gender identity and social acceptance. The fact that the nickname has been used for a long time and is accepted by their partner and friends suggests that the change could be meaningful for their self-identity and relationships.\n\nThe parents disapproving is a common concern in family dynamics, but the person isn't being disrespectful necessarily; they're seeking to align their name with how they've been perceived and their identity. The grandfather's memory is important, but the person isn't erasing it\u2014just not using the name that was a tribute in a way that's causing them distress.\n\nSo, considering their age, the reasons for the change, and the lack of any clear wrongdoing beyond personal choice, the answer is likely B. The person isn't in the wrong for wanting to change their name to something they feel represents them better, even if family disapproves.\n"
