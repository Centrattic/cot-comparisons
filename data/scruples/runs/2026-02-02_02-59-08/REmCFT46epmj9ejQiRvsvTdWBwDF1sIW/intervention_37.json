My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for wanting to change her name. Let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, the author is a woman named after her grandfather with a typically male name, like \"John.\" She mentions that her parents didn't use the female version, so she's stuck with a name that's not very girly. She's been teased at school and now, at 21 and engaged, wants to change both her first and last name to a nickname derived from her current last name that her friends use. Her mom is upset, saying she wouldn't accept the new name and thinks she's dishonoring her grandfather. The author is considering going ahead anyway.\n\nI need to decide if she's in the wrong. Let's think about the factors. The name was given by her parents with a specific gesture, honoring her grandfather. However, the name has caused her significant emotional distress through teasing. She's using a nickname for years now, which her fianc\u00e9 and friends use. She's an adult, so she's making her own decisions now. \n\nIs it wrong to change her name for her own comfort and identity? Well, the name is part of her legal identity, but she's choosing to change it to something she feels more connected to. The mother's disapproval is based on honoring the grandfather, but the author's reasons are about her own well-being. Society often allows people to change their names, especially when it's about personal identity and happiness. The parents' intention is understandable, but the child's experience is negative. The author isn't necessarily wrong if it's about self-identity and reducing bullying effects. Plus, she's not changing her family name entirely, just creating a new name from her current last name. \n\nBut the user initially thought the author is in the wrong. Maybe they feel that the gesture of her parents is important, and going against that is disrespectful. However, respecting her own feelings and choosing a name that makes her feel more like herself is also a valid point. At 21, she's of legal age and can make her own decisions. The key here is whether the name choice is a personal matter versus a familial obligation. Since she's being teased and the name doesn't fit her identity, it's more about her personal experience. The mother's reaction is hurt, but the author's right to self-determination might take precedence. \n\nSo, balancing the two, the answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong. She's taking control of her identity and her future, which is a common reason for name changes. The mother's disapproval is painful, but the author's autonomy is important. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
