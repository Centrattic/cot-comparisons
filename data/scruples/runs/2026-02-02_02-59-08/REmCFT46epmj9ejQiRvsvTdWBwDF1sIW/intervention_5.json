My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that she was given a male name by her parents, which was her grandfather's name. She's a girl, and the name is like \"John\" with no girly nickname. She's been teased for it, and now she wants to change her name to a nickname based on her current last name. Her mom is against it, saying she's forsaking her grandfather's memory. She's 21 and engaged, so she's probably going to proceed despite her mom's disapproval.\n\nFirst, the question is whether changing her name is the wrong thing to do. The user thinks she's in the wrong, but I need to consider both sides. On one hand, her parents had a reason for naming her after her grandfather, and changing the name might feel like disrespecting that memory. On the other hand, she's been teased for her name, leading to emotional distress, and she's using a nickname that her friends and fianc\u00e9 know her by. She's an adult now, so she has the autonomy to make decisions about her identity. \n\nAutonomy is a big factor here. Legally and morally, once you're an adult, you can decide your name regardless of family opinions. The emotional impact of being teased and the desire to live authentically could be strong arguments for her right to change it. However, the cultural or familial significance of the name might weigh on the other side. But since she's already using the nickname in social settings, it's more about aligning her legal name with how she's been known for years. \n\nHer mother's reaction is about feeling that she's forsaking the grandfather's memory. But if the name was given with the intention of honoring the grandfather, maybe the author is still honoring him in her own way by choosing a name that's meaningful to her. Or maybe the grandfather's name was given as a male name, and she's not honoring him by keeping a name that causes her distress. \n\nAlso, the fianc\u00e9 using the nickname suggests that the new name is part of her identity in her personal life, so changing the legal name would make things consistent. The fact that she's been using the nickname for a long time might mean that the new name isn't just a whim but a reflection of how she's been perceived and how she wants to be known.\n\nIn terms of whether she's in the wrong, if the mother is not the one changing the name, but the author is choosing her own legal name, then it's her right. The mother's disapproval is hurtful, but the author has the autonomy. The mother might feel hurt, but the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for prioritizing her own well-being and authentic identity. \n\nSo, considering all these points, the answer would likely be B, that the author is not in the wrong. The key points are her autonomy, the long-term use of the nickname, the impact of the name on her life, and the fact that she's an adult making decisions for herself.\n"
