My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who posted the question is in the wrong for wanting to change their name. The situation is that they were given a male name by their parents, which is a family name from their grandfather. The name is \"John,\" which is short for a male name with no girly nickname. They've been teased for it in school and now at 21, they want to change both their first and last name to a nickname based on their current last name, which friends have used. Their mom is against it, saying she won't accept the new name and thinks they're forsaking their grandfather's memory.\n\nSo the key points here: The person was given a name that's male and doesn't have a female version. They've faced bullying over it. They've used a nickname for a long time, even in social settings, and their fianc\u00e9 uses that nickname. The mom is upset and disapproves, but the person wants to proceed. The question is whether they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rights of individuals to change their names. In many places, adults have the legal right to change their names without needing approval from family members. So legally, the person isn't in the wrong. The name change is a personal choice, especially since they're an adult. The fact that they've used the nickname for a long time and the name change would align with their identity and how they're known socially is a strong point in their favor.\n\nThen there's the emotional aspect. The mother feels that the name change is disrespecting the grandfather's memory. However, the person is trying to honor their grandfather's name by keeping the nickname derived from the last name, which might still keep a connection. The person is addressing the issue of being teased and wanting to feel more comfortable in their own skin. That's a valid personal need. \n\nThe mother's disapproval is hurtful, but the person's autonomy as an adult takes precedence. The mother's feelings are important, but the person has the right to make decisions about their own name. It's a matter of balancing family bonds against personal identity and well-being. \n\nAlso, the fact that the fianc\u00e9 uses the nickname suggests that the new name is already accepted in their personal and social life, which makes the transition smoother. The person isn't rejecting the family history entirely; they're finding a way to honor it while also asserting their own identity. \n\nSo putting this together, the answer is likely B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The person is making a choice that affects their own life and well-being, and they have the right to do so even if family members disagree. The mother's feelings are valid, but the person's autonomy is key here.\n"
