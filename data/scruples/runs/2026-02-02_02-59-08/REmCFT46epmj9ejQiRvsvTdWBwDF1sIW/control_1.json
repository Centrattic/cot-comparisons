My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person (a woman) is in the wrong for changing her name from a male name given by her parents. She wants to change both her first and last name, using a nickname based on her current last name. Her mom is upset because she thinks it's forsaking her grandfather's memory.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The name was chosen by the parents to honor the grandfather, but it's a male name with no female version. The person has been teased for it and uses a nickname socially. Now, she's 21 and engaged, wanting to legally change her name. Her mom disapproves and says she wouldn't accept the new name.\n\nThe main issue here is autonomy vs. family tradition. The person has the right to choose her own name, especially as an adult. Being teased at school is a valid reason for wanting a change. Also, using a nickname that friends use for years shows she's been associated with that identity. However, the parents' feelings about the grandfather's memory are important. But since she's an adult, her decision should be respected. The mother's disapproval doesn't make the person wrong; it's more about family conflict rather than right or wrong. So, the answer would be B (No, she's not in the wrong).\n"
