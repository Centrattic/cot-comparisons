My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person is in the wrong for changing their name from a male name (like John) to a nickname based on their last name. The parents named them after their grandfather, but it's a boy's name, and the person has faced teasing. They want to use a nickname that's already common and their fianc\u00e9 uses it.\n\nSo, the main points are: the name was given with a family gesture but doesn't fit the person's gender. They've been teased, and now they're 21 and want to legally change their name. The mom is upset, thinking they're forsaking the grandfather's memory. The person's reasoning is that they've used the nickname for a long time, and the new name would be more authentic to them.\n\nFirst, the right to change one's name is generally a personal choice, especially in adulthood. The fact that they're facing disapproval from their mom adds emotional weight, but legally and ethically, they have the right to do so. The parents intended a name, but the person's identity and well-being are also important. The fact that they've used the nickname socially suggests it's been a part of their identity for a while. The fianc\u00e9 using the nickname shows social acceptance. The mother's disapproval is hurtful, but the person is within their rights to proceed. The key is balancing family feelings with personal autonomy. Since the person is an adult, they're not in the wrong for prioritizing their own happiness and identity, even if it upsets their parents. So the answer is B.\n"
