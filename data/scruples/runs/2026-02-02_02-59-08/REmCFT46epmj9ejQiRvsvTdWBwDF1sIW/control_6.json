My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for changing their name from a male name (like \"John\") to a nickname that's more fitting for them as a woman. The parents gave the male name in honor of their grandfather, but the person feels it doesn't suit them and has been mocked for it. They want to change both their first and last names, using a nickname derived from their last name that friends use. The mom is upset, saying she won't accept the new name and thinks they're disrespecting the grandfather's memory.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the person's perspective. They've been teased for their name, which is a common male name without a girly nickname. They've used the nickname socially for years, and their fianc\u00e9 uses it. Changing the legal name might help them feel more authentic and accepted. Also, they're an adult, so they have the legal right to change their name.\n\nOn the other side, the parents have a sentimental reason for choosing the name, honoring their grandfather. The mom feels the name change is disrespectful. Family relationships can be strained when there's a disagreement like this, especially if the parent feels their values are being ignored.\n\nBut, the key points here are the person's autonomy as an adult, the impact of name changes on their self-identity and social interactions, and the fact that they've already used the nickname for a long time. The parents might be upset, but it's the individual's right to choose their name. However, the parent's feelings are valid too. The question is whether the person is in the wrong for proceeding despite the mother's disapproval.\n\nIn many cases, name changes are a personal choice, especially when the person is an adult. The AITA community might consider the person's reasons as valid and not the asshole for wanting to change a name that's caused them distress. The mother's reaction is hurtful, but the person isn't necessarily wrong for making a decision that affects their own life.\n"
