My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for changing their name from a male name given by their parents to a nickname that feels more like their identity. The parents named her after the grandfather, but it's a boy's name with no female equivalent. She's been teased for it and now wants to change both her first and last name to a nickname derived from her current last name. Her mom is upset, saying she's forsaking her grandfather's memory.\n\nFirst, the key points here are autonomy versus family tradition. The author is 21 and engaged, so she's an adult. The right to choose one's name is a personal choice. But there's a conflict with the family's feelings. The mother's disapproval is a factor, but does that make the author wrong? \n\nIn many societies, especially in Western ones, adults have the legal right to change their names. The emotional impact on the parents is significant, but the author's well-being and comfort with her identity might be more important. The nickname has been used by friends and her fianc\u00e9, indicating that it's part of her social identity. \n\nHowever, the argument against her might be that she's disregarding her family's wishes and the significance of her grandfather's name. But if the original name caused her distress and she's been using the nickname for a long time, maybe the change is valid. \n\nConsidering autonomy and the potential for the name to affect her happiness and social life, the author might not be in the wrong. The mother's feelings are valid, but the author's right to self-identify could outweigh that. So, the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
