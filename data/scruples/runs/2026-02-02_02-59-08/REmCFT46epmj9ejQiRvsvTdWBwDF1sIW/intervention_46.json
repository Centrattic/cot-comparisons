My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to change her name. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe author is a woman who was named after her grandfather, but the name is a boy's name\u2014like \"John.\" She mentions that there's no female version of it, so her name is a short male name without a girly nickname. She's been teased about it in school and now, at 21 and engaged, she wants to change both her first and last name to a nickname that her friends use, which is based on her current last name. Her mom is upset, saying she'd never accept the new name and thinks it's forsaking her grandfather's memory. The author's fianc\u00e9 uses the nickname, and she's always used the nickname in social settings.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong for proceeding despite her mom's disapproval. The user thinks she is in the wrong, but I need to consider other angles.\n\nFirst, the right to change one's name is a personal choice. In many places, adults can legally change their names without needing permission from family. The author is an adult, so she has autonomy over her identity. The nickname has been her social name for a long time, which might indicate that she's been using it as her de facto name. If the name change is about her comfort and self-identification, that's a personal matter.\n\nOn the other hand, her mother feels that changing the name is dishonoring her grandfather. There's a cultural or familial value here about preserving the grandfather's name. However, the author's reasons\u2014being teased and wanting to use a name that feels more like her own\u2014are valid. The mother's disapproval might be based on tradition or emotional attachment, but that doesn't necessarily mean the author is wrong to prioritize her own well-being and identity.\n\nThe key points are: autonomy, personal identity, long-standing use of a nickname, and the impact on her mental health (due to being teased). The mother's feelings are important, but they shouldn't override the adult child's rights. The fianc\u00e9's acceptance and usage of the nickname also support the idea that the new name is a natural extension of her identity.\n\nSo, considering these factors, the author isn't in the wrong. She's making a choice that aligns with her identity and well-being as an adult, which is her right. The mother's disapproval is unfortunate but doesn't make the author wrong. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, she's not in the wrong).\n"
