My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to change her name. The situation is that she was given a male name (like John) by her parents, which was meant to honor her grandfather. She's been teased for it, uses a nickname that her friends know her by, and now wants to legally change both her first and last names. Her mom is against it, saying she's forsaking her grandfather's memory.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the reasons she wants to change her name. The main points are being teased, using a nickname that feels more authentic, and her fianc\u00e9 using the nickname. Name changes are personal and often about identity and comfort. If the current name causes her distress and she's been using a different name socially, legally changing it can be a way to align her legal identity with how she presents herself.\n\nHer parents named her after her grandfather, which is a family tradition. The mom's reaction is strong disapproval, but the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key here is that the author has the right to choose her own name, especially if it's impacting her well-being. While family feelings matter, the ultimate decision should be hers as an adult. The fact that her fianc\u00e9 uses the nickname also suggests that this change is meaningful to her current life and relationships.\n\nSo the answer would be B (No), she's not in the wrong. Name changes are a personal choice, and while respecting family is important, her right to self-identify and her well-being take precedence.\n"
