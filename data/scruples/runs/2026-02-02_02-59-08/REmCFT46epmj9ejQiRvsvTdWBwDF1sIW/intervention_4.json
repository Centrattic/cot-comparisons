My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about changing her name from a male name given by her parents, which is causing her issues. She wants to change both her first and last name to a nickname based on her last name. Her mom is upset because she thinks she's dishonoring her grandfather.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The name was chosen by her parents, possibly with a specific intention (honoring her grandfather). But the name is male, and she's a girl, leading to teasing. She's been using a nickname for a long time, even her fianc\u00e9 uses it. She's 21 and wants to change her name legally. Her mom disapproves and says she won't accept the new name.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the name was given by her parents, but she's an adult now. Adults have the right to make decisions about their own lives, including their names. The issue is whether changing the name is disrespecting her grandfather. But if the nickname is something she's used for years, maybe it's more about her identity now. The mother's reaction is emotional, but the author's well-being is also important. People can change their names for various reasons, especially if it affects their happiness and how they're perceived.\n\nHer parents might feel hurt, but she's not doing it out of spite; it's to feel more comfortable. The fact that she's been using the nickname in social settings shows it's been her identity for a while. So, maybe she's not in the wrong. The answer might be B, not in the wrong.\n"
