My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the person in this situation is in the wrong. Let me read through the details again.\n\nThe person is a girl who was given a boy's name, \"John,\" by her parents, which was named after her grandfather. She mentions that there's no female version of the name, and it's been a source of teasing for her throughout school. Now that she's 21 and engaged, she wants to legally change both her first and last name to a nickname based on her current last name that her friends use. Her mom is against it, saying she won't accept the new name and thinks it's forsaking her grandfather. The person is considering going through with the name change despite her mom's disapproval.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong for wanting to do this. The options are A (yes) or B (no).\n\nFirst, I should consider the person's perspective. She's an adult now, 21, which in many places is the age of majority. That means she's legally an adult and can make decisions about her own name without needing parental approval. The fact that she's been using a nickname for her name in social settings and her fianc\u00e9 uses that name suggests that she's been living with that identity for a while. The teasing she experienced in school could have had a lasting impact on her self-esteem, so changing her name might be a way to reclaim her identity and feel more comfortable in her own skin.\n\nOn the other hand, her parents named her after her grandfather, which was a meaningful gesture. Her mom feels hurt that she's moving away from that legacy. The mother's disapproval is emotional, thinking that changing the name is forsaking her grandfather's memory. Family traditions and names can hold a lot of weight in some cultures or families, so this might be a significant point for her mom.\n\nBut then, the person argues that the name given to her is a male name with no female equivalent, which has led to negative experiences. She's not just changing her name for vanity but to align with her identity and stop the teasing. Since she's an adult, the right to autonomy over her own name is a key factor here. Legally, unless there are specific restrictions (which the scenario doesn't mention), she can change her name if she chooses.\n\nThe mother's reaction is hurtful and disapproving, but does that mean the daughter is in the wrong? Or is it about the daughter's right to self-determination? The mother's feelings are valid, but the daughter's right to choose her name might take precedence, especially given the negative impact the original name had on her.\n\nSo weighing these factors, the person is an adult making a decision that affects her own life. Her reasons are about self-identity and well-being. The mother's disapproval is unfortunate, but the daughter isn't in the wrong for seeking to change her name. Therefore, the answer would be B (No).\n"
