My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the person (a girl) is in the wrong for changing her name from a male name, like \"John,\" to a nickname that's more reflective of her identity, even though her parents named her after her grandfather.\n\nFirst, the user is 21 and engaged. She's been using the nickname for a while, and even her fianc\u00e9 uses it. The parents didn't name her the female version of the grandfather's name, leading to her being teased. The mom is upset, thinking she's forsaking the grandfather's memory.\n\nSo, the main factors here are personal identity versus family tradition. She's been using the nickname in social settings for a long time, which suggests it's important to her self-identity. Changing her name is a significant decision, but it's her legal name. The mother's concern is about honoring the grandfather, but the child might feel that the name doesn't fit her and is causing her distress.\n\nLegally, she can change her name as an adult. The ethical question is about respect for family wishes versus personal autonomy. Since she's an adult, the decision is hers to make, even if it upsets her parents. The nickname has been her social name for years, so transitioning to it legally might be more about consistency with her identity.\n\nThe mother's reaction is emotional, but the daughter's well-being and comfort are also important. Being teased for a name that doesn't fit can affect self-esteem. The grandfather's memory is honored by the original name, but the daughter is choosing a name that aligns better with her identity. It's a balance between honoring the past and embracing her present and future.\n\nSo, the answer would lean towards B, not in the wrong. She's making a choice that affects her own life and happiness, which is valid even if it upsets her parents.\n"
