My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for changing their name from a male name to a female one. The situation is that the parents named them after the grandfather, a short male name like John, and the author wants to change it to a nickname that's a female version. They're being teased at school, and now they're engaged and considering changing both first and last names.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the reasons given. The author mentions being teased, which is a significant emotional impact. Using a nickname that friends already use and the fianc\u00e9 uses suggests that this name is important to their identity now. The parents are upset because they feel it's forsaking the grandfather's memory. But does the author have the right to change their name if it's causing them distress?\n\nName changes are personal. In many places, adults can legally change their names as they choose, especially if they're of age. The parents' disapproval is a factor, but the author is an adult now. The key points are whether changing the name is a reasonable choice for the author's well-being and identity. The fact that they've used the nickname socially indicates they've integrated it into their life. The parents' reaction is emotional, but it's the author's name to change. So, the answer would likely be B, not in the wrong. The parents' feelings are valid, but the author's right to self-identify is stronger here.\n"
