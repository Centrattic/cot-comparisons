My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to change their name from a male name to a female one, which they've used as a nickname. Their parents named them after their grandfather, but the name is short and doesn't have a girly nickname. The author faces teasing and wants to change both first and last name to a nickname version.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the reasons the author gives. They mention being made fun of in school, which is a significant emotional impact. The name they were given is a male name, which doesn't fit their gender identity in terms of how they want to present themselves. They've been using the nickname for a long time, and their fianc\u00e9 uses it too, so it's part of their identity now. \n\nOn the other hand, the parents feel the name is a tribute to their grandfather, and the daughter changing it might seem like she's rejecting that connection. The mother is upset about this. The question is whether the author is wrong to proceed despite the parents' disapproval.\n\nI think about autonomy and personal identity. People have the right to choose their names, especially when it aligns with their gender identity or personal comfort. The teasing and the lack of a suitable female nickname suggest that the current name causes distress. Changing a name to better fit one's identity isn't inherently disrespectful. The grandfather's memory is honored through the original name, but the daughter is creating a name that feels authentic to her. \n\nHowever, the parents' feelings are valid, and the daughter might need to consider how to honor her grandfather while making her own choice. Maybe finding a middle ground, like keeping the original name in some contexts while using the nickname publicly. But the key here is that the author is adult and has the legal right to change her name. Her well-being is important too. So while there's a conflict of feelings, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for prioritizing her own identity and comfort. The mother's disapproval is unfortunate, but not a justification for the author being in the wrong.\n"
