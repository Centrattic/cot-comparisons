My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to change her name. The context is that her parents named her after her grandfather, but it's a male name that doesn't have a female equivalent. She's been teased for it and now wants to change her name to a nickname her friends use, which is based on her current last name. Her mom is upset about it, feeling like she's disrespecting her grandfather's memory.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The person is 21, so an adult. They're making their own decisions now. The name was given with a gesture (honoring the grandfather), but it's not a female version, leading to teasing. The person has been using the nickname socially for a long time, and their fianc\u00e9 uses it. The mom disapproves, but the person is going through with the change despite that.\n\nLegal rights: In most places, adults can legally change their names without parental consent. So legally, she's within her rights. The ethical question is whether she's in the wrong for going against her parent's wishes here. The parent's argument is about honoring the grandfather. But the person's argument is about their own identity and well-being.\n\nBalancing respect for family and personal autonomy. The person is choosing a name that feels more authentic to them, which is important for self-identity. The parent's reaction is about tradition and honoring the grandfather, which is understandable. But the person is an adult, so their autonomy might take precedence. The fact that she's been using the nickname for a long time suggests it's part of her identity now. The fianc\u00e9 using the nickname also shows social acceptance.\n\nIs she forsaking the memory? Maybe not. She's keeping the nickname based on her last name, so it's a variation. The grandfather was honored in her original first name, changing the last name might be less about dishonoring him and more about her own identity. The mother's disapproval is about the real name, but the person is changing both first and last names. The original first name was a male name, so changing it away from the grandfather's name might be the issue. However, the nickname-based last name might not directly conflict with the grandfather's name, so maybe it's a way to honor him through the last name while finding a first name that suits her better.\n\nThe main conflict is between family tradition and personal autonomy. In many cases, adults are allowed to make their own choices even if it upsets family. The key is whether the action is disrespectful versus just a personal choice. Since the person was given a name that caused her distress, especially in school, changing it to something that aligns with her identity and reduces negative experiences seems reasonable. The mother's disapproval is strong, but that doesn't make the daughter wrong in choosing her own path. So the answer is B (No).\n"
