My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that she's a girl named after her grandfather with a male name like \"John,\" and she's considering changing her name to a nickname based on her current last name. Her parents disapprove, especially her mom, who feels she's forsaking her grandfather's memory. The author has faced teasing in school and wants to use the nickname she's always been called by, even in her engagement. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. Should someone have the right to change their name if it's causing them distress? In many places, changing your name is a personal choice as long as it's legal. The fact that she's 21 and an adult means she's legally allowed to make this decision. Her parents' disapproval might be hurtful, but does that mean she's in the wrong?\n\nThen there's the part about the grandfather. The parents named her after him, which she appreciates the gesture, but the name is a male name without a female version. The grandfather is part of the reason for the name, but if the name is causing her ongoing issues, maybe that's a valid reason to change it. She's been teased throughout school, which can affect self-esteem and mental health. The nickname is something she's used socially, and her fianc\u00e9 uses it too, indicating it's her preferred identity now.\n\nHer mom's reaction is about feeling like she's forsaking the grandfather's memory. But if the name is causing her pain, is it selfish to keep it? Or is honoring the grandfather's memory more important than her well-being? There's a balance between respecting familial traditions and personal happiness.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9 calling her by the nickname might indicate that this new name is part of her authentic self, which is important in a marriage. Disrespecting the parents is one thing, but if the name change is for her own mental health and she's being respectful, maybe it's justified.\n\nI think the key points are autonomy, well-being, and respect. She's making a decision that affects her own life, and while the parents are upset, she's not necessarily in the wrong if she's being respectful and there's a valid reason like harassment and personal identity. The parents can disapprove, but the author is within her rights to change her name. So the answer would be B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
