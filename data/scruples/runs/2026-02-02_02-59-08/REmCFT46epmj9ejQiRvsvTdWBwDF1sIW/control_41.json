My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for changing their name from a male name (like John) to a nickname that's more feminine. Their parents named them after their grandfather, but didn't use the female version. They've been teased about their name and now they want to change both their first and last name to the nickname they've used socially. Their mom is upset, saying she won't accept the new name and thinks they're dishonoring their grandfather.\n\nFirst, I need to consider their reasons. They mentioned being teased throughout school, which is a significant emotional impact. Using the nickname they've always used socially and that their fianc\u00e9 uses makes sense for personal identity. The parents' reasoning is about honoring the grandfather, but they didn't use the female version when naming them. That seems like a cultural or familial choice they made, not something the person chose. \n\nChanging one's name is a personal choice, especially when it affects their self-perception and social interactions. The mother's disapproval is tough, but the person has the right to choose their own name. The grandfather's name was a gesture, but the person isn't rejecting the memory entirely\u2014they might carry it in other ways. The key here is autonomy versus family expectations. Since the person is an adult and the name change affects their own identity and happiness, they aren't in the wrong for making that choice. The mother's feelings are valid, but the person's right to self-determination is stronger here.\n"
