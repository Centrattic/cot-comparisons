My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to change their name from a male name given by their parents. The author explains that their parents named them after their grandfather, who had a name like \"John,\" which is a short male name without a girly nickname. The author has faced bullying in school and now, at 21 and engaged, wants to change both their first and last name to a nickname derived from their current last name that friends use. Their mom disapproves, saying she'd never accept the new name and feels the author is forsaking their grandfather's memory. The author is considering going through with it despite the mom's disapproval and is asking if they're the one at fault.\n\nI need to figure out if the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B). Let's break it down. Name changes are a personal choice, especially when it comes to identity and comfort. The author has been using the nickname for a long time, and their fianc\u00e9 uses it too. Changing the name could be about how they want to present themselves to the world. However, the parents gave the name with a specific intention, honoring the grandfather. The mom's reaction is about respecting that legacy. \n\nBut the key here is the age of the author. At 21, they're an adult, and changing their name is their right. The parents might disapprove, but they can't stop them. The author isn't wrong for prioritizing their own well-being and identity, especially after years of being teased. The grandfather's memory is honored in the name given, but the author is now choosing a name that feels more authentic to them. The parents might feel hurt, but the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for making that choice. It's about personal identity versus familial expectations. In many cases, adults are free to change their names for personal reasons, so the answer leans towards B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
