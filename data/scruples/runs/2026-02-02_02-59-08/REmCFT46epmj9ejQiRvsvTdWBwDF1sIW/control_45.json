My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole?) post is in the wrong for wanting to change their name. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe author is a woman named after her grandfather, but the name given is a typically male name like \"John.\" Her parents didn't use the female version of the name. She's been teased for it and now wants to legally change both her first and last name to a nickname that her friends use. Her mom is upset and says she won't accept the new name, thinking it's forsaking the grandfather's memory. The author is 21, engaged, and her fianc\u00e9 uses the nickname.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rights of the individual. In many places, adults can legally change their names for any reason, especially if it's to better reflect their identity or for personal reasons. The author mentions using the nickname socially, which suggests she's been living under that name for a while. Changing it legally might just formalize that.\n\nNext, the parents' perspective. The mom feels the name change is disrespectful to the grandfather. But the author was named after him, not the nickname. The original gesture was about honoring him, but the author's choice to change could be seen as a way to still respect the intent but adjust for her own identity. The parents can't necessarily control the child's name once they're an adult. Also, the author is in a committed relationship now, which might influence her decision for legal and marital reasons.\n\nThe key points here are autonomy and respect. The author has the right to choose her name as an adult. The parents' disapproval is hurtful, but the author's well-being and comfort with her name are important. The fact that she's been using the nickname for a long time and her fianc\u00e9 uses it supports her case. The parents' feelings are valid, but the author isn't wrong for prioritizing her own identity and the practical aspects of being teased.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is probably B (No, the author is not in the wrong). She's making a personal choice that affects her life, and while the parents are upset, she's within her rights and it's about her self-expression and happiness.\n"
