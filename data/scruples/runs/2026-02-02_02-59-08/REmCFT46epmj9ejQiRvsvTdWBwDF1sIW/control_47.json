My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for changing their name from a male name given by their parents to a nickname they've used. The original name was chosen after their grandfather, but there's no female version. The person has faced teasing and now wants to legally change their name, which includes the last name, as their fianc\u00e9 uses the nickname. Their mom is upset, thinking it's forsaking her grandfather.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation. The key points are the person's comfort with their name, the parents' intentions, and the family reaction. The name given by the parents is male, and the person is female, leading to teasing. They've used a nickname for years, and now want to make it official. The mother's disapproval is significant here.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, changing one's name is a personal choice. The parents gave a name with a specific meaning, but the person's experience with that name has been negative. The nickname they want to use is already part of their identity. The fianc\u00e9 uses it, so it's part of their personal and social identity. The mother's disapproval is a family matter, but the person's right to self-identify is important. So, the person isn't in the wrong for wanting to change their name to something they identify with, even if it goes against the parents' wishes. The parents can be disappointed, but the decision isn't unethical. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
