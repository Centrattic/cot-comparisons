My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for changing their name from a male name given by their parents to a nickname derived from their last name. The parents named them after their grandfather, but didn't do the female version. The name is like \"John,\" which is short and male, and they've been teased for it. Now, they're 21, engaged, and want to legally change both first and last names. Their mom is upset, saying she won't accept the new name and thinks they're dishonoring the grandfather. The fianc\u00e9 uses the nickname, which they feel is more theirs.\n\nSo, the question is whether they're in the wrong (A) or not (B). Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the parents gave them a name that doesn't fit their gender. The user is female and has a male name without a feminine counterpart. That's a common issue. Being teased for it at school is another point. At 21, they're legally an adult, so the right to change their name is there. The mother's disapproval is emotional, but does that make the user wrong?\n\nChanging one's name is a personal choice, especially when it affects their identity and well-being. The mother's argument is about honoring the grandfather, but the user is using a nickname from their current last name, not completely discarding family ties. Also, the fianc\u00e9 uses the nickname, which shows it's been part of their identity for a while.\n\nIn terms of ethics, respecting family wishes is important, but so is individual autonomy. Since the user is an adult, they have the right to make decisions about their own identity. The mother's disapproval might lead to conflict, but that doesn't make the user wrong. The key points are the user's well-being, the name being a poor fit for their gender, and the age being appropriate for such a decision.\n\nI think the answer is B, the user is not in the wrong. They're making a choice that aligns with their identity and happiness, which is valid even if the family disapproves.\n"
