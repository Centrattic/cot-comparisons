My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for changing their name. The situation is that they were given a male name by their parents, which is causing them issues because they're a girl. They want to change their name to a nickname that's more gender-appropriate and their fianc\u00e9 uses it. The parents are upset, especially the mom, who feels it's disrespecting the grandfather.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the arguments for both sides. The author's reasoning is about personal identity and comfort. They\u2019ve been teased at school, so changing their name might help them feel more like themselves. Using a nickname that friends already know them by could make them feel more authentic. On the other hand, the parents see the original name as a tribute to the grandfather, and changing it might conflict with that sentiment. The mom's disapproval is strong here.\n\nBut then, does the author have the right to change their name despite the family's feelings? Legally, they can change their name as an adult. Emotionally, it's about personal identity versus family tradition. The question is whether respecting their identity overrides the parents' wishes. Also, the fact that the nickname is already used in social settings suggests it's a natural progression of their self-identification.\n\nThe user initially thought the author is in the wrong but is curious about the opinion. The key points are the impact on the author's well-being versus the family's feelings. If changing the name helps the author feel more comfortable and authentic, that's significant. However, the parents' feelings are valid too. But ultimately, the decision to change a name is a personal one, and while it's considerate to consider family feelings, they can't hold the person back from their own identity. So, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
