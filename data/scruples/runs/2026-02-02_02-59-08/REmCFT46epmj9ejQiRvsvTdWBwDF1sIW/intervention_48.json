My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for wanting to change her name from a male name to a female one. She was named after her grandfather, but it's a male name with no female version. She's been teased at school, and now she's 21 and engaged, planning to change both her first and last name to a nickname her friends use. Her mom is upset and says she's forsaking her grandfather's memory.\n\nFirst, I need to consider her reasons. She's been made fun of, which is a valid reason for wanting a name change. At 21, she's legally an adult, so she has the right to make decisions about her name. The fact that her fianc\u00e9 uses the nickname suggests that it's something she's comfortable with in her personal life. Also, the nickname is based on her last name, which might be a creative solution.\n\nOn the other hand, her parents named her after her grandfather, which is a significant familial gesture. Her mother's disapproval is based on honoring the grandfather's memory, which is a cultural or family value. However, the author feels that the name isn't suitable for her identity, especially as a woman. The key here is that she's seeking a name that aligns better with her identity and has been a nickname she's used socially, which could mean it's part of how she presents herself to others.\n\nThe conflict is between family tradition and personal identity. In many cases, changing one's name is a personal choice, especially when it affects one's sense of self and well-being. The fact that she's been teased indicates that the current name has caused her distress, which supports her decision. However, the grandmother's sentiment about honoring the grandfather is also valid from a family perspective.\n\nBut the main point is autonomy. At 21, she's an adult and can choose her name regardless of her parents' wishes. The mother's disapproval is hurtful, but the author isn't doing anything illegal or unethical by changing her name. The question is whether she's in the wrong for proceeding despite her mother's disapproval. Since it's her life and she's choosing a name that makes her comfortable, it's more about personal choice versus family tradition. \n\nI think the answer leans towards her not being in the wrong. The AITA format often looks for who is being unreasonable. Here, the mother is not approving, but the author is acting in her own best interest. So the answer would be B, No.\n"
