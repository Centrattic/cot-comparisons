My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong for wanting to change their name. The person was given a male name by their parents, which was named after their grandfather. The name is short, male, no girly nickname, so they've been teased. Now they're 21, engaged, and want to change both first and last names to the nickname they've used. The mom is against it, saying it's forsaking the grandfather's memory. The question is if the person is in the wrong for going ahead despite the mom's disapproval.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The name was given by parents, but it's a male name for a girl, causing her distress and teasing. The name change would be to a nickname that's been used by friends and even the fianc\u00e9. The mother is upset, but the person is an adult now, 21, so legally they can make their own decisions. The main conflict is between the individual's desire for a name that fits her identity and the parents' wishes, specifically the mother's.\n\nLegally, the person is an adult, so changing the name is her right. The name change is about personal identity and comfort, which is a valid reason. The mother's disapproval is a family issue, but the person is not wrong for making a choice that affects her own life. The grandfather was honored by the original name, but the person is still honoring the intent (the gesture) while adjusting the name to fit her identity better. The fact that the nickname is already in use and accepted by friends and partner supports that it's her true name now, in practice.\n\nHowever, some might argue that changing the name could be seen as disregarding family tradition or disrespecting the grandfather's memory. But the person is not rejecting the grandfather entirely; she's just adapting the name to better suit her. The mother's disapproval is emotional, but the person's right to self-identify is also important. In AITA scenarios, the focus is often on whether the person did something clearly wrong. Here, the person is taking a personal step for their well-being, so it's likely they are not in the wrong. The answer would be B.\n"
