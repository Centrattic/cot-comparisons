My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for wanting to change their name from a male name (like John) to a female one. Their parents named them after their grandfather, but they were always called by a nickname. Now they're 21, engaged, and want to legally change both first and last names. Their mom is upset and says she won't accept the new name, thinking they're dishonoring the grandfather. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The name given by parents was a male name, which caused them to be teased. They've used a nickname since school, and their fianc\u00e9 uses that nickname too. The parents see the name change as forsaking their grandfather's memory. The person is over 18 and has the legal ability to change their name. \n\nLegal right here is important. In most places, adults can change their names without parental consent. The main issue is the moral or emotional aspect. The parents feel disrespected because the name is tied to their grandfather. But the person is changing their name for their own well-being and identity, which is a personal choice. \n\nThe fact that they were teased for the name is a significant factor. Being made fun of can affect someone's self-esteem and social life. Choosing a name that aligns with their gender identity or personal identity is a valid reason. The nickname they used is part of their identity now, and they want it to be their legal name. \n\nThe parents' disapproval is hurtful, but adults have the right to make decisions about their own names. The conflict here is between honoring family tradition and respecting an individual's autonomy. Since the person is an adult, their right to self-identify and the impact on their own life might outweigh the parents' feelings. \n\nHowever, some might argue that the person is ignoring the family's sentiment. But the person isn't doing this out of disrespect; they're trying to be true to themselves. The parents could be upset, but the author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing their own identity and comfort. \n\nSo, considering all that, I think the answer is B (Not in the wrong). The author has the right to choose their name, especially given the circumstances of being teased and wanting to use a name that aligns with their identity. The parents' disapproval is unfortunate, but the author isn't wrong for making this choice.\n"
