My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this \"Am I the Asshole\" scenario is in the wrong for wanting to change her name. The author was given a male name by her parents, based on her grandfather's name, and she's been teased for it. Now she wants to change her name to a nickname her friends use, and her mom is upset about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the motivations. The author feels that her given name doesn't fit her gender identity or personal identity. She's been bullied, which is a valid reason for wanting to change her name. The right to self-identify is important, especially if it affects her well-being. On the other hand, her parents named her after her grandfather, which was a meaningful gesture. The mother is upset because she feels the author is dishonoring her grandfather by changing her name. \n\nBut here's the thing: while the parents' intentions were good, the child has the autonomy to make decisions about her own identity, especially as an adult. The mother's disapproval is based on tradition and family legacy, but the daughter's comfort and identity are also significant. The fact that she's been using a nickname for a long time and her fianc\u00e9 uses it suggests that this is a part of her identity she's comfortable with. \n\nLegally, adults can change their names if they want, so there's no legal wrongdoing. Ethically, it's more about personal choice versus family expectations. The mother's reaction is emotional, but the daughter isn't necessarily wrong for prioritizing her own needs and happiness. The key points are autonomy, identity, and the right to self-determination. \n\nSo, considering all this, the answer is probably B, the author is not in the wrong. She's making a choice that aligns with her identity and well-being, even if it upsets her family. The mother's disapproval is valid in terms of feeling hurt, but the daughter isn't in the wrong for choosing her own name.\n"
