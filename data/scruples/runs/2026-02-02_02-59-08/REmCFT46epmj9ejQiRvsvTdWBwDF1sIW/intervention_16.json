My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong for wanting to change their name. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe author is a girl named after her grandfather, but the name is a male name, like \"John.\" She mentions that the name doesn't have a female version, and she's been teased for it throughout school. Now that she's 21 and engaged, she wants to legally change both her first and last names. The new first name is based on the nickname her friends use, which is derived from her current last name. She told her mom, who is upset, saying she doesn't approve and thinks she's dishonoring her grandfather. The author is considering going ahead despite her mom's disapproval.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B). The user initially thought the author is in the wrong but wants a second opinion.\n\nFirst, let's consider the legal aspect. In many places, adults can legally change their names without their parents' consent once they're of age. Since the author is 21, she's an adult, so legally she has the right to change her name. That seems like a point in her favor for being in the right.\n\nNext, the emotional and familial aspect. Her mom is upset, feeling that she's dishonoring her grandfather. The name was chosen with a gesture (honoring grandpa), but the author is now choosing a name that feels more authentic to her. This touches on personal identity versus family tradition. The author argues that the name has caused her distress and that she's been using the nickname for a long time, which her fianc\u00e9 also uses. It seems like the nickname is her preferred identity now.\n\nThe key points here are autonomy and respect for personal identity versus family legacy. On one hand, changing your name as an adult is a personal choice and part of self-expression. On the other hand, the mother's feelings of the name honoring her husband (the author's grandfather) might be hurt by the change. But the author didn't choose the name initially and has had a hard time with it.\n\nI think the balance here leans towards the author not being in the wrong because she's making a decision that affects her own life and well-being. While her mother's feelings are valid, the author has the right to choose her own name, especially if it's causing her emotional distress. The mother's disapproval is hurtful, but it doesn't negate the author's right to self-identify with a name that feels right to her. The fact that she's been using the nickname socially for years suggests it's an established part of her identity now.\n\nSo, considering all this, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
