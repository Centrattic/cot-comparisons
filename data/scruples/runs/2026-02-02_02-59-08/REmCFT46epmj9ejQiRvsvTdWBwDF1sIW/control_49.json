My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're at fault for wanting to change their name. They were given a male name after their grandfather, but it's causing them distress because it's not a female version or a nickname. They've been teased and want to use a nickname derived from their last name. Their mom is upset, saying it's forsaking their grandpa's memory.\n\nFirst, the right to change one's name is generally a personal choice. People often change names for various reasons like gender identity, cultural shifts, or personal preference. The fact that the name was given with a gesture (honoring grandpa) is important, but the person is now an adult and can make their own decisions. The mother's disapproval is hurtful, but it's her choice to go ahead despite that. The fianc\u00e9 using the nickname shows acceptance in their personal life. There's no legal wrongdoing here; name changes are legal in many places. The emotional impact on the person (bullying, wanting to use a name that feels right) supports their decision. The mother's feelings are valid, but they don't override the individual's autonomy. So the answer is B, they're not in the wrong.\n"
