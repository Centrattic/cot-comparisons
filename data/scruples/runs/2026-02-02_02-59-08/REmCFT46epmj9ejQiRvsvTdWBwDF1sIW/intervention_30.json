My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to change their name from a male name (like \"John\") to a nickname that feels more personal. The author mentions that their parents named them after their grandfather, but they were given a male name instead of the female version. They've been teased at school and now, at 21 and engaged, they want to legally change both first and last names. Their mom is upset, saying she won't accept the new name and thinks it's forsaking the grandfather's memory.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The person is an adult, 21, so they're legally allowed to make their own decisions. They've been using a nickname for years, which their friends and fianc\u00e9 use. The parents gave them a male name, possibly due to naming after the grandfather, which might not have had a female equivalent. The author is now seeking to formalize their chosen name, which they feel is more authentic to them.\n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know the opinion. The main question is whether changing the name is wrong despite the parents' disapproval. \n\nLegally, adults can change their names, so there's no legal wrong. Emotionally, the mother feels hurt, thinking the author is disrespecting the grandfather. However, the author is prioritizing their own identity and well-being, which is valid. The parents' names might be part of their heritage, but when it causes ongoing distress, especially in social settings (like school teasing), the importance of self-identity becomes a factor. \n\nThe author's fianc\u00e9 uses the nickname, which suggests that their partner supports the change, adding to the personal validation. The conflict is between the author's autonomy and the parents' wishes. Since the author is an adult, their autonomy is a strong point. The parents' feelings are understandable but not a reason to deny the author's right to self-identify. The grandfather's memory is important to the family, but the author is not erasing it\u2014perhaps they're still honoring it in their own way. \n\nPossible counterarguments: Maybe the author could have used a different nickname that still had the grandfather's essence. But the situation states that the nickname is based on their current last name, so maybe there's no direct link. However, the author's intention to change the name is about personal identity, not necessarily about honoring the grandfather. \n\nIn conclusion, the author is an adult making a choice that affects their own life, which is their right. The parents' disapproval is significant but doesn't make the author wrong. So the answer would be B (not in the wrong).\n"
