My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for changing their name from a male name to a female one. The name was given by their parents after their grandfather, but the person feels it's a male name like \"John\" without a female version. They've been teased about it and now want to change both first and last names, using a nickname that friends and their fianc\u00e9 use. Their mom is upset, saying it's forsaking their grandfather's memory.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). I need to figure this out based on the situation.\n\nFirst, the name was given by parents with a specific intention, but the child is now an adult. The name causes them distress and social issues. Changing one's name is a personal choice, especially when it affects their well-being. The parents might feel hurt, but at 21, the person is of age to make their own decisions. The grandfather's memory is important to the parents, but the individual's identity is also significant. The fianc\u00e9 and friends already use the nickname, indicating social acceptance. The mother's disapproval is strong, but that doesn't necessarily mean the person is wrong. \n\nIn many cultures, name changes are allowed, especially for personal reasons. The key points are the individual's autonomy, the impact on their life, and the parents' disapproval. While the parents' feelings are valid, the person's right to self-identify and change their name for their own well-being seems to outweigh the parents' disapproval. The grandfather's memory is honored in the original name, but the person might feel that the nickname better represents them now. \n\nSo, the answer would likely be B (No), the author is not in the wrong. They have a valid reason for wanting to change their name, and their autonomy as an adult is a key factor.\n"
