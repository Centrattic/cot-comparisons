My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for changing her name from a male name, which was given to her in honor of her grandfather. The parents didn't use the female version, so her name is like \"John,\" a typically male name. She's been teased in school, and now she's 21 and wants to change her name to a nickname derived from her current last name. Her mom is upset, saying she's forsaking her grandfather's memory.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The person is an adult, 21 years old, which is of legal age to make her own decisions. The name was chosen by her parents in honor of her grandfather, but it's a male name without a female equivalent, leading to teasing. The nickname she wants to use is already established among friends and her fianc\u00e9 uses it. Her mom's disapproval is strong, but the author is choosing to proceed despite that.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the main factors are autonomy and the reason for the change. Since she's an adult, she has the legal right to change her name. The reasons given are personal\u2014being teased and the name not feeling like hers. The mother's disapproval is emotional, tied to honoring the grandfather. However, the author's well-being and identity are also important. Changing her name to something that she identifies with more strongly isn't inherently wrong, especially when it's causing her distress. The mother's feelings are valid, but they shouldn't override the daughter's autonomy and happiness in this case. So the answer is B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
