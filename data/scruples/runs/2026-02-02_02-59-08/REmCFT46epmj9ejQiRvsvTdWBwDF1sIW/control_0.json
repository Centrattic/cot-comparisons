My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole?) story is in the wrong. Let me read through the details again to make sure I understand.\n\nThe author is a woman named after her grandfather with a male name, like \"John,\" but she's used a nickname based on her last name instead. She's being teased for her name in school and now wants to legally change both her first and last names to the nickname her friends use. Her mom is upset, saying she wouldn't accept the new name and thinks it's forsaking her grandfather's memory. The author is 21 and engaged, and her fianc\u00e9 uses the nickname. The main question is whether she's in the wrong for changing her name despite her mom's disapproval.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and personal aspects. Legally, adults can change their names for any reason, right? There's no law that says you can't change your name because it offends family members. So from a legal standpoint, she's within her rights.\n\nThen there's the emotional and familial aspect. Her mom is upset because she feels this disregards her grandfather's memory. The author's name was a gesture from her parents, but it's causing her distress and social issues. She's been teased for it, which is a valid reason for wanting to change it. The nickname she uses is more how she identifies, especially since her fianc\u00e9 uses it, so it's part of her personal identity now.\n\nBut is she in the wrong for prioritizing her own comfort and identity over her mother's feelings? Well, people have the right to choose their own names, especially if it's affecting their well-being. However, there's a cultural aspect too. Sometimes family names and traditions carry weight, and the mother might feel that changing the name is breaking that tradition. But the author isn't just changing the name to spite her parents or forget her grandfather\u2014she appreciates the gesture but finds the name problematic. The nickname is based on her last name, so maybe it's a way to keep a connection while adjusting for her needs.\n\nAlso, the mother's reaction is strong\u2014saying she'll never accept the new name and being \"insanely mad.\" But the author is an adult, so she has autonomy. While the mother's feelings are valid, they don't override the daughter's right to make choices about her own identity. The key here is that the author is not doing this to disrespect her grandfather directly, but to have a name that fits her better and reduces the negative attention she's faced.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the author is not in the wrong. She's making a decision that affects her own life and well-being, and there's no malicious intent. The mother's disapproval is hurtful, but that doesn't make the daughter the asshole. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
