I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for changing their name. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThey were given a male name by their parents, named after their grandfather. The name is something like \"John,\" which is a short, masculine name without a typically girly nickname. They've been teased for it in school, which is understandable. Now they're 21 and engaged, wanting to change both their first and last names. The new first name is a nickname derived from their current last name that friends have used. They mentioned this to their mom, who is upset and feels they're disrespecting their grandfather's memory. The author wants to proceed despite the mother's disapproval.\n\nFirst, I should consider the person's right to choose their own name. Legally, adults can change their names, so that's a point. The mother's disapproval is emotional, but the author is an adult now, so their autonomy is important. The name change is about their comfort and identity, especially since they've been using the nickname in social settings for a long time. The fianc\u00e9 also uses the nickname, which suggests their partner supports them.\n\nHowever, the mother's perspective is that the name honors the grandfather. The author acknowledges the gesture but feels the name doesn't fit. There's a cultural aspect here too\u2014some cultures place a lot of importance on family names and traditions. But the author is making a practical choice to avoid being teased and to feel more like themselves.\n\nI need to balance the respect for family tradition against the individual's right to self-identity. Since the author is an adult, their autonomy is key. The mother's feelings are valid, but the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for changing their name. They're not erasing the grandfather entirely; the original name is still their legal name, but they're choosing to use a nickname that feels more authentic to them now. So, the answer is probably B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
