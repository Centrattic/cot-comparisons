My name is practically \"John\", a short male name that doesn't have a girly nickname. I've been made fun of it all throughout school, and now that I'm 21 and engaged I'm looking into changing my first AND last name, to a \"nickname\" based off of my current last name that my friends have always used for me. I brought it up to my mom and she says she'd never accept the new name as my real name and that she thinks I'm forsaking the memory of my grandfather. She has made it clear she doesn't approve and would be insanely mad.\n\nAITA for wanting to do it anyways? I've always gone by this nickname in social settings so it feels more like my name than my real name does. My fiance even calls me by that name.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to change her name from a male name to a nickname based on her last name. The parents named her after her grandfather, but she's been teased for it. She's 21 and engaged, wants to change both first and last names. Her mom is upset, says she's forsaking her grandfather's memory.\n\nFirst, the key points here: the name was given with a specific intention (honoring the grandfather), but the author feels it's not suitable for her identity. She's been teased because it's a male name, and she's using a nickname that friends use. The fianc\u00e9 uses that nickname too. The mother disapproves and would be mad.\n\nSo, is she in the wrong? Well, the ability to choose one's name is a personal right. People often change names for various reasons like gender identity, cultural reasons, or just personal preference. The author is changing it to something she feels represents her better, especially since she's been using the nickname in social settings for a long time. The parents' disapproval is based on honoring the grandfather, but the author is making her own choice about her identity. \n\nHowever, the mother's feelings are valid. Honoring family members is important, and the author is changing a name that was meant to honor her grandfather. But at the same time, the author is an adult now, so she has the autonomy to make decisions about her own name. The teasing she's faced might add to the justification for changing it. The fianc\u00e9 using the nickname also shows that this name is accepted in her personal life.\n\nSo, the conflict is between respecting family legacy and personal identity. In most cases, adults have the right to change their names for personal reasons, even if it causes family tension. The mother's disapproval doesn't make the author wrong unless there's a legal or ethical issue, which there isn't here. The author isn't doing harm, just asserting her identity. Therefore, the answer is probably B (not in the wrong). But I need to make sure there's no cultural or legal factors mentioned. The scenario doesn't specify any such factors. So the answer is B.\n"
