I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. \n\nFirst, let me recap the scenario. The author is a 22-year-old guy in a long-distance relationship that started online. They met, had a good time, including physical intimacy. The girl expressed love, but the author didn't reciprocate. Now, he's conflicted because he's developed feelings but doesn't see her as a long-term partner. He wants to keep the relationship going for fun and experience while also pursuing others, but he doesn't want to cheat. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are:\n\n1. The relationship is long-distance with a mutual agreement to meet and spend time. They had a romantic and sexual connection.\n2. The girl expressed love, but the author hasn't. The author is worried about the future of the relationship but is keeping it going for enjoyment and to avoid hurting her.\n3. The author wants to \"pursue other girls\" while maintaining this relationship. He's trying to gain experience to prepare for a future relationship, but this seems to involve emotional and possibly physical infidelity.\n\nNow, thinking about the dynamics of relationships. If the relationship is monogamous, then pursuing others would be a breach of trust. However, the author hasn't clarified the relationship's boundaries. The girl might believe they're in a monogamous relationship, especially since she moved to visit him and expressed love. If the author is not honest about his intentions and continues to be in a relationship where he's planning to be with others, that's deceptive.\n\nThe author mentions he doesn't want to cheat, but the plan to \"pursue other girls\" while in a relationship with her implies that he's considering emotional or physical intimacy with others, which would be cheating unless it's an open relationship. Since there's no indication that the relationship is open, the author is likely engaging in a monogamous relationship under false pretenses.\n\nAlso, the author is using the girl for experience without intending long-term commitment, which could be seen as manipulative. Even if he doesn't want to hurt her, keeping her in the dark about his intentions and continuing the relationship while planning to pursue others is dishonest. The girl might not be aware that he's not committed to a monogamous relationship.\n\nSo, the author's actions involve deception and a lack of commitment to the current relationship. That would make him the asshole because he's not being honest and is leading the girl on. The answer should be A.\n"
