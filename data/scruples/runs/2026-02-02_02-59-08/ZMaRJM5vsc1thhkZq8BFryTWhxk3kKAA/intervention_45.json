I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the long post is in the wrong for maintaining a long-distance relationship and pursuing other girls. The author has a history with a girl he met on Tinder, and after some back and forth, they met in person, had a good time, and she's clearly into him. He's now worried about his feelings growing more and wanting to explore other relationships without cheating.\n\nFirst, the key issue here is whether the author is being honest with the girl. The post mentions that he hasn't committed to a relationship and hasn't said he loves her. But he's also not clear about his intentions. He wants to keep things going with her but is considering pursuing other girls. If the relationship is ongoing, even if it's not officially defined, pursuing others would be a problem if there's an expectation of exclusivity. However, the author hasn't explicitly stated that the relationship is exclusive. The girl might assume it is, especially after they met and had intimate moments. The author's hesitation to say \"I love you\" and his fear about future commitment suggest he's not in it for the long term, which the girl might not be aware of. \n\nBy pursuing other girls without being upfront, the author is setting up a situation where the girl could be emotionally harmed. Even if he doesn't want to break her heart, continuing the relationship under the guise of exclusivity while planning to date others is deceptive. The fact that he's maintaining the relationship for experience and not for commitment shows a lack of respect for her feelings. The author is in the wrong because he's using her for emotional and physical connection without being honest about his intentions. The question is whether the relationship is exclusive. If it's not, maybe there's no issue, but given the context, it's likely the girl expects some level of exclusivity. Therefore, the author should either clarify the relationship's status or be upfront about his intentions to pursue others.\n"
