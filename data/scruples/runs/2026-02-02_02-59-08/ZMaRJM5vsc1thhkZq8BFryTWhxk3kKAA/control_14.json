I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is a long-distance relationship where the guy met a girl online, they talked a lot, had a connection, met in person, and things were great. But he's now feeling conflicted because he's afraid of developing deeper feelings and not wanting to commit long-term. At the same time, he's thinking about pursuing other girls to gain experience before finding his \"soulmate.\" The key question is whether he's being unfair to the girl by maintaining the relationship while also looking for others.\n\nFirst, the basics of relationships: honesty and mutual expectations. If the guy isn't in a committed monogamous relationship, then pursuing other girls might be okay. But if they're in a monogamous relationship, then he's being dishonest. However, the story mentions that when she said she loves him, he didn't say it back but explained why. That might indicate that the relationship isn't officially monogamous, or maybe it's an open relationship. But the user didn't mention if they discussed boundaries or if it's an open arrangement.\n\nHe also says he's not cheating but considering pursuing others. If it's a casual or open relationship, then maybe it's okay. However, the problem is that he's leading her on. He's been with her for a long time, met in person, had sex, and she's clearly emotionally invested. If he's not planning to commit but wants to keep her around while also seeing others, that could be manipulative. He's not upfront about his intentions, which could hurt her later. The pressure he feels might be because she's into him, and he's not matching her emotional investment. \n\nAlso, the idea that he needs to \"gain experience\" by dating others while keeping this girl is a red flag. It sounds like he's using her for practice, which isn't fair. Even if they're not in a monogamous relationship, being transparent is important. If he's not clear about his intentions, he's not being honest, which is a problem. \n\nSo, the main points are: lack of clear communication about his intentions and the possibility of leading her on. If the relationship is supposed to be exclusive and he's pursuing others without her knowledge, that's wrong. But if it's an open relationship, then maybe not. However, given the information, there's no indication that they discussed an open arrangement. Therefore, he's likely being dishonest and using her without clear boundaries, which makes him the asshole for not being upfront and potentially hurting her later.\n"
