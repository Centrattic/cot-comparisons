I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is a long-distance relationship where the guy is keeping it going but also pursuing other girls. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the guy met a girl on Tinder, she became very attached, and he pulled away. Then later, after some time, they reconnect, meet up, and she ends up staying with him. He's now worried about his growing feelings and the pressure he feels. He wants to keep the relationship but also go out with other girls to gain experience for his future. The main question is whether he's acting wrong by continuing the relationship while pursuing others.\n\nI need to consider the nature of the relationship. If it's not exclusive, then maybe he's not in the wrong. But if the relationship is supposed to be monogamous, then pursuing others would be cheating. The original scenario mentions that they were planning to meet and she bought a ticket to visit him. The guy hasn't explicitly stated whether they're in a committed, monogamous relationship or if it's open. However, the way he's describing his actions suggests he's involved with her romantically while also looking for others, which could be considered deceptive.\n\nThe key points here are consent and communication. If the girl is aware that the guy is open to other relationships and has agreed to it, then maybe it's okay. But if he's leading her to believe that they're in a monogamous relationship while secretly pursuing others, that would be wrong. The guy mentions he's not sure if she still has a boyfriend at the time he reconnected with her, which adds confusion. Also, he's conflicted about breaking up because he doesn't want to hurt her, but he's not being honest about his intentions.\n\nIn many cultures, relationships are expected to be monogamous unless otherwise agreed. If the guy isn't honest about his intentions to pursue others, he's being deceptive. The girl's affection and his fear of hurting her suggest that she might be emotionally invested without knowing the full story. So, by keeping her in the dark about his plan to pursue others, he's not being truthful, which could be considered wrong.\n\nOn the other hand, if the guy is upfront and they've agreed to a non-monogamous arrangement, then it's different. But the scenario doesn't mention any such agreement. The guy's own reasoning is that he's gaining experience for the future, implying that he's not committed to this relationship long-term and is using her for that purpose. That's a red flag because it shows a lack of commitment and potential manipulation.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the guy is likely in the wrong because he's entering into or maintaining a relationship without clear communication about his intentions to pursue others, which could lead to emotional harm to the girl. He's prioritizing his own needs without considering hers, which is a key aspect of ethical relationships.\n"
