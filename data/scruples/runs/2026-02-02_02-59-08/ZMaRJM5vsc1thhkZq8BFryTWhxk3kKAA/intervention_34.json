I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for maintaining a long-distance relationship while pursuing other girls. The author is 22, had a LDR for about a year with a girl he met on Tinder, and they haven't met until recently. After meeting, his feelings grew, but he's still considering pursuing others because he believes he needs experience before finding his \"one.\" He doesn't want to break up with her because he thinks it would hurt her, but he's worried about cheating if he keeps the relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider what makes a relationship healthy. If the author is in a monogamous relationship, then pursuing others would be a breach of trust. The key here is whether the relationship was defined as non-monogamous from the start. The girl originally became attached over messages, and he gave her the cold shoulder to avoid her falling in love. Now, after meeting and sharing intimate moments, he's still thinking about pursuing others. \n\nThe author mentions he didn't say \"I love you\" back, but he's been in a LDR and planned a visit. Even if he didn't express love, the emotional and physical intimacy suggests a committed relationship. By continuing to pursue others without being honest about his intentions, he's likely leading her on. The fact that she bought a train ticket and visited him shows her investment and commitment, whereas he's not reciprocating that level of exclusivity. \n\nHis reasoning about needing experience for his future relationship is a bit selfish. It's using the current partner as a stepping stone, which isn't fair. If he's not willing to be monogamous, he should have communicated that upfront. Now, he's creating a situation where he could potentially hurt her by cheating or ending things later when he's ready. \n\nEven if he's not in love yet, the intimacy and time invested should require some level of honesty and commitment. The pressure he feels is on himself to maintain this balance, but the girl deserves to know where she stands. The author's actions risk emotional harm to her, which makes him at least partially responsible. \n\nSo, the answer is A. The author is in the wrong because he's not being honest about his intentions and is potentially leading her on while planning to pursue others.\n"
