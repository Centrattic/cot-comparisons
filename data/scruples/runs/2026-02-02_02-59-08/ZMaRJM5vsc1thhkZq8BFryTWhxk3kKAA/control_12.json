I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for maintaining a long-distance relationship and pursuing other girls. The key points from the situation are:\n\n1. The author met a girl on Tinder, they had a two-month conversation without meeting. She became very attached, which made him uncomfortable. He then gave her the cold shoulder, possibly due to fear of her falling in love with him. \n\n2. After ten months, he reconnects with her, they talk a lot, and she ends up confessing her love. He didn't reciprocate but explained why. They planned a meet-up, had a good time including intimacy, and he now feels his feelings have grown. However, he's worried about the long-distance aspect and the pressure of her affection.\n\n3. His main dilemma is wanting to keep this relationship while also pursuing others to gain experience before finding a \"soulmate.\" He fears cheating if he continues this path but doesn't want to break her heart now.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider the ethical aspects. In any relationship, honesty and commitment are usually expected. The author is in a long-distance relationship but is also considering pursuing others. That sounds like he's not fully committed, which could be seen as deceptive. He didn't reciprocate her love initially but now is keeping the relationship going while planning to move on. \n\nAlso, he's concerned about breaking up with her because he thinks it would hurt her. However, keeping her on a string while he looks elsewhere isn't fair. She might believe there's a future, but he's not ready to commit. This could lead to emotional harm later if she finds out. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that he wants to gain experience before settling down, but that doesn't justify being in a relationship without full honesty. If he's open about his intentions from the start, maybe it's different, but the way he's described suggests he's not being upfront. So, he's creating a situation where she might be emotionally invested without his full commitment. That's typically considered the wrong approach. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because he's not being honest about his intentions, which can lead to emotional harm for the other person.\n"
