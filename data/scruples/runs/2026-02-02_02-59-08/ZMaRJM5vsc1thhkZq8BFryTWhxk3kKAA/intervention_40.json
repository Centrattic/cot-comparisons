I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the long post is in the wrong. The author is in a long-distance relationship but wants to pursue other girls. They met a girl through Tinder, had a long-distance relationship, met in person, and now they're both attached but the author feels conflicted about their growing feelings and the fear of getting too deep into a relationship they don't think is serious. They also mention wanting to gain experience with other girls while not wanting to cheat. The question is whether they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The author is in a committed long-distance relationship where they've met in person, had intimate moments, and the girl has expressed love. The author hasn't reciprocated the love but is still maintaining the relationship. Now, they're considering pursuing other relationships while keeping this one, which would be non-monogamous. The problem is whether this is ethical or not.\n\nIn most relationships, especially when one person has expressed love (even if not reciprocated), maintaining exclusivity is usually expected unless both parties agree to an open or polyamorous arrangement. The author hasn't mentioned discussing this with the girl. If the author is pursuing other relationships without her knowledge or consent, that's cheating, which is generally considered wrong. Even if they're not cheating yet, the intention to do so while being in a committed relationship is problematic.\n\nAlso, the author is using the girl for emotional connection and physical intimacy while planning to move on later. That could be seen as using her and not being honest about their intentions. The girl put effort into the relationship, including financial commitment (buying a train ticket), and the author might be leading her on without a clear path forward. The author's reasoning that they don't want to hurt her by breaking up now is a red flag because it's not the other person's responsibility to wait and be hurt later. The right approach would be to be honest about their intentions from the start.\n\nSo, the author is aware of their own limitations and doesn't see this girl as a long-term partner. They're maintaining a relationship that's built on a false premise of exclusivity. That's being dishonest and is manipulative. Therefore, they are in the wrong.\n"
