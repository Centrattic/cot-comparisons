I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is a long-distance relationship, and the author is considering pursuing other girls while maintaining this relationship. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author met a girl online, she became attached, he pulled away because he didn't want her to fall too hard. Then after some time, they reconnect, meet up, have a good time, and she says she loves him. He doesn't reciprocate the love but doesn't break up with her. Now he's worried about his growing feelings and the pressure she's putting on him. He also wants to gain experience with other girls before finding his \"one,\" which makes him consider cheating.\n\nThe main issue here is whether it's wrong to continue the relationship while seeing others. The user is asking if the author is the asshole (A) or not (B).\n\nSo, the author is in a committed relationship, even though it's long-distance. If he's in a monogamous relationship, pursuing others would be cheating, which is wrong. But the text doesn't explicitly say if the relationship is monogamous. The author didn't confirm if she has a boyfriend, but she did mention she had one before. However, after reconnecting, they planned to meet, and she bought a ticket to visit him. The author hasn't broken up with her yet but is considering it because he doesn't want to hurt her.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that he's scared of getting too attached and doesn't want to commit yet, so he's trying to gain experience. But continuing the relationship while planning to be with others is a problem. Even if he's not in a monogamous relationship, being emotionally committed while seeing others can still be deceitful. Also, after meeting and having intimate moments, she's in love, and he's not, which adds to the problem. The author is using her for experience, which is manipulative.\n\nSo, whether the relationship is monogamous or not, the key is honesty. If he's not going to be faithful, he should end the relationship. Otherwise, he's leading her on and could hurt her. Therefore, the author is in the wrong (A).\n"
