I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this long post is in the wrong. The situation is about a long-distance relationship where the guy is maintaining it but also wants to pursue other girls. He's conflicted because he doesn't want to cheat but feels he might if he continues. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The guy met a girl online, she became attached, he pulled back, then reconnected later. They had a physical meetup, and he's now feeling conflicted about his growing feelings and the possibility of pursuing others. He mentions his mindset of wanting experience to prepare for a future \"real\" relationship. \n\nSo, the main issue here is whether it's wrong to be in a relationship while also considering pursuing others. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate that.\n\nIn most relationships, especially ones that involve physical intimacy and meeting in person, there's an expectation of exclusivity. The fact that they had sex and planned meetings suggests they're in a committed relationship. If the author is considering pursuing other girls, that's a form of cheating or at least emotional infidelity. Even if he hasn't acted on it yet, the intention to do so while being in a relationship is problematic. \n\nHe also mentions that he hasn't broken up with her yet, partly because he doesn't want to hurt her. But keeping someone in the dark about his intentions could be hurtful in the long run. The author's justification is that he wants experience for the future, but that doesn't negate the harm he could cause to the current partner. \n\nEthically, being in a committed relationship and planning to pursue others without the partner's knowledge is generally considered wrong. The author isn't being honest about his intentions, which is a breach of trust. Even if the relationship wasn't formalized with a clear commitment, the actions taken (meeting in person, having sex, planning future visits) imply a level of exclusivity that the author is violating by his intentions. \n\nSo, yes, the author is in the wrong. He's not being truthful, and his actions could lead to emotional harm for the girl. The fact that he's aware of the potential for cheating but still wants to continue the relationship while pursuing others makes it a clear ethical issue.\n"
