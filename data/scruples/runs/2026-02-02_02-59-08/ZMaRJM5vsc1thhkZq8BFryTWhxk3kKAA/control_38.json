I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for maintaining a long-distance relationship while pursuing other girls. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is 22, started a long-distance relationship with a girl he met on Tinder. They didn't meet for a while, and he started giving her the cold shoulder because he feared she was getting too attached. Later, they reconnect, she confesses her love, he doesn't reciprocate but isn't against the relationship. They meet up, have a great time, and now he's worried about their future because his feelings have grown, but he's also considering pursuing other girls to gain experience for his future \"soulmate.\"\n\nKey points: The author is in a committed relationship (they plan to meet again) but is thinking about pursuing other girls. The relationship isn't monogamous as he's planning to have other relationships. He also acknowledges that breaking up now would hurt her, but he doesn't want to. His reasoning is that he wants experience to avoid messing up his future \"real\" relationship.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. From a typical ethical standpoint, being in a relationship usually implies some level of exclusivity unless otherwise agreed. The author is planning to pursue others while in this relationship, which could be seen as deceitful if he hasn't communicated that to his partner. The fact that he's aware he might cheat if he continues suggests he's not being truthful with her, which is a problem.\n\nAlso, the situation where he gave her the cold shoulder previously shows a lack of consideration for her feelings. Now, he's avoiding commitment, which might not align with her expectations, especially since she expressed love for him. If he can't commit, being in a relationship with her while pursuing others is likely to cause harm.\n\nHowever, the user might argue that the relationship is long-distance and not officially defined. But even in long-distance, emotional commitment often exists. The author's plan to use her for experience without considering her emotional well-being is problematic. \n\nConsidering all that, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because he's not being honest about his intentions and is potentially leading her on, which is manipulative and hurtful. It's important to have clear communication and mutual understanding in relationships, which is lacking here.\n"
