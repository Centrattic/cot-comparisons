I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a long-distance relationship where the guy is considering pursuing other girls while maintaining the current relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the key points. The guy met a girl on Tinder, they had a long-distance relationship, met up, and things were good. He's now worried that his feelings might grow too strong and that he'll want to explore other relationships as part of his plan to get experience before finding his \"one.\" He doesn't want to cheat but feels like he might if he continues with the current relationship. He's conflicted about breaking up with her because it might hurt her, but he doesn't see her as his future partner.\n\nThe main issue here is whether it's ethical to be in a committed relationship while also planning to pursue others. The user mentions that he's in a long-distance relationship, which can be challenging even without additional complexities. The key question is whether the current relationship is exclusive. If it's not, then maybe he's not in the wrong. But if it is supposed to be exclusive, then pursuing others would be problematic.\n\nThe author says he hasn't defined the relationship as exclusive. However, the girl is affectionate and has expressed love, which might imply expectations of exclusivity on her part. If the author isn't clear about his intentions and continues to engage in behavior that could be seen as deceptive or manipulative, that could be considered wrong. He's using her for experience without committing, which might be emotionally harmful to her.\n\nAlso, he's planning to break up in the future, which could hurt her. Even if he waits, the fact that he's considering pursuing others while in a relationship suggests a lack of commitment and respect for her feelings. The author's rationale\u2014that he's just trying to gain experience\u2014doesn't necessarily justify his actions if the relationship isn't consensually non-exclusive.\n\nIn many cultural contexts, even if a relationship isn't formally exclusive, being emotionally intimate with someone while pursuing others can be seen as misleading. The girl might not be aware of his intentions, leading to potential emotional harm when the relationship ends. The author's fear of his own feelings growing is a personal issue, but it doesn't excuse the possible harm to the other person.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the author is in the wrong because he's engaging in behavior that could emotionally harm the girl, even if he doesn't intend to cheat yet. His actions lack full transparency and respect for her feelings, especially if she expects exclusivity.\n"
