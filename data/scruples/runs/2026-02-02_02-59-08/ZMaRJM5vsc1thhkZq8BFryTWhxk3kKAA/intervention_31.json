I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The person is in a long-distance relationship and is considering pursuing other girls while maintaining the current one. The key issue here is whether that's ethical.\n\nFirst, the user's situation: They met a girl online, had a connection, then drifted apart. Later, they reconnected, spent time together, and she expressed love. He didn't reciprocate but explained why. Now, he's feeling conflicted because he likes being with her but is also thinking about pursuing others. His main concern is not hurting her, but he's afraid of cheating if he doesn't explore other relationships.\n\nThe core question is whether it's wrong to keep the relationship while pursuing others. The main ethical point here is honesty and commitment. If he's not in a monogamous relationship, then maybe it's okay, but if he's leading her to believe it's exclusive, that's a problem. The user mentions they haven't discussed exclusivity yet. However, she bought a train ticket to visit him, stayed in his room, and he's planning future meetups. This seems like a committed setup, so even if they haven't explicitly said they're exclusive, they might be acting as if they are.\n\nHe's also thinking about pursuing other girls because of his belief that he should gain experience before finding his \"soulmate.\" This mindset is a red flag. If he's not committed to monogamy, he should be upfront. However, if the relationship is supposed to be exclusive, then pursuing others would be dishonest and a betrayal, even if there's no official label. The fact that he's worried about hurting her by breaking up suggests he's invested in making her feel secure, which conflicts with his desire to see others. That's a classic sign of being in the wrong because he's not being truthful about his intentions. \n\nThe user might argue that it's not cheating as long as both parties are okay with it. But since he's not sure about his own feelings and is keeping his options open, he's not being honest. The ethical thing would be to either commit to a monogamous relationship or be transparent about his non-monogamous intentions from the start. Since he's not, and he's leading her on, he's in the wrong. So the answer is A.\n"
