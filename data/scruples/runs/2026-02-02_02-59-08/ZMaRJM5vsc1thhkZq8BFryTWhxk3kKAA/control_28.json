I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a long-distance relationship where the guy is also considering pursuing other girls. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the key points. The author and the girl started a relationship through Tinder, had a long-distance setup, met up, and things went well. The girl is affectionate and even said she loves him. Now, after the meeting, he's feeling conflicted because he doesn't want to commit fully and is thinking about pursuing other relationships.\n\nThe main issue here is whether having a long-distance relationship while also seeing others is ethical. Long-distance relationships can be challenging because of the physical separation, which might lead people to seek emotional or physical connections elsewhere. But the key is whether there's mutual understanding about the relationship's boundaries. \n\nThe author didn't mention that the girl is aware he's dating others. If the relationship is exclusive, then pursuing other girls would be a breach of trust. However, if they agreed it's non-exclusive from the start, maybe it's different. The problem arises when one person expects exclusivity and the other doesn't. \n\nThe author also mentions he's not ready to commit long-term and wants to gain experience for the \"future soulmate.\" This mindset might be problematic because it treats the current relationship as a stepping stone rather than a genuine connection. The girl, on the other hand, seems to have deeper feelings, as she expressed love and bought a ticket to visit him. If she believes the relationship is exclusive, then his intention to pursue others might be hurtful and deceptive.\n\nAnother point is the author's fear of hurting her if he breaks up now. He's using this as a reason to continue the relationship, even though he might not be fully committed. This could be emotional manipulation, where he keeps her in the relationship while planning to move on, leading to potential heartbreak later.\n\nSo, the author is in a position where he's leading the girl on without being honest about his intentions. Even if he doesn't cheat, the deception is a problem if the relationship is supposed to be exclusive. The ethical issue here is about honesty and mutual expectations. If both parties are not on the same page regarding exclusivity, then the author is indeed at fault for not clarifying things upfront.\n"
