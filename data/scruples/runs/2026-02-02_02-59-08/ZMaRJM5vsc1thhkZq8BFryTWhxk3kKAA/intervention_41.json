I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the situation is in the wrong. The person is in a long-distance relationship and is considering pursuing other girls while maintaining the current relationship. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The man met a girl online, they had a long-distance relationship. He was scared of her getting too attached and gave her the cold shoulder. Then, after some time, they reconnected, met in person, and she fell in love. He didn't return the love but they continued the relationship. Now, he's worried about his growing feelings and the pressure, so he's thinking of pursuing other girls. \n\nThe main issue here is honesty and commitment. If he's in a relationship, even a long-distance one, and he's considering pursuing others, that's a red flag. The girl has expressed love, and he hasn't reciprocated. By continuing the relationship without being honest about his intentions to also date others, he's being deceptive. \n\nLong-distance relationships are already challenging because of the physical separation. Trust and communication are crucial. If he's not ready to commit and is planning to see other people, he's not being truthful to her. It's unfair to keep her in a situation where she's invested emotionally, especially after she's declared her love, while he's not giving the same commitment.\n\nHe also mentions his mentality about gaining experience for the \"one.\" While it's common for some people to date multiple people before finding a serious relationship, doing so without the partner's knowledge is dishonest. The girl deserves to know if he's not in it for the long term and if he's open to seeing others. \n\nEven if he doesn't want to break up with her right now, continuing the relationship under false pretenses is a setup for hurt. If he continues and later decides to see others, it would be a betrayal of her trust. The fact that he's planning to see other girls while in a relationship where she's in love with him is a clear ethical issue.\n\nSo, the answer would be A (Yes, he's in the wrong) because he's not being honest and is leading her on while intending to pursue others. It's important to be upfront about one's intentions to avoid emotional harm.\n"
