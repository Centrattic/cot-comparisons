I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for maintaining a long-distance relationship while pursuing other girls.\n\nFirst, the setup: the author is 22, had a long-distance relationship with a girl he met on Tinder. They never met until recently, and after spending time together, he's developed stronger feelings but also feels conflicted. He's now considering pursuing other girls while keeping this relationship, fearing he might cheat if he doesn't address his feelings.\n\nKey points to consider:\n1. **The nature of the relationship**: The author mentions they were planning to meet, had a three-day visit, shared intimate moments, and the girl expressed love. This seems like a committed LDR, even if it's not formalized. The fact that she bought a train ticket and stayed in his room suggests a level of commitment from her side.\n2. **Author's intentions**: He's not in love but enjoys her company, wants to avoid hurting her, and feels pressured. He's also thinking about future relationships and gaining experience. His main concern is that pursuing others might lead to cheating, which he wants to avoid.\n3. **Honesty and communication**: The author hasn't been upfront about his intentions. He's keeping her in the relationship without being clear that he's not fully committed and is planning to pursue others. This could be seen as deceptive.\n4. **Potential harm**: If the author continues the relationship without honesty, it could lead to emotional harm for the girl if she's under the impression of exclusivity or a future together. The author is aware of this but is delaying a breakup to avoid immediate hurt.\n\nEthical considerations:\n- **Consent and honesty**: Relationships require mutual understanding. If the author isn't willing to be completely honest about his intentions (i.e., that he's seeing others and not committed), he's not giving the girl full consent to be in the relationship.\n- **Emotional manipulation**: By keeping her engaged and not setting boundaries, the author might be leading her on, which can be emotionally damaging. Even if he doesn't want to break her heart, the lack of honesty is a form of manipulation.\n- **Personal growth vs. responsibility**: While the author is trying to gain experience for future relationships, he's neglecting his responsibility towards the current partner. Prioritizing his own needs without considering hers could be seen as selfish.\n\nPossible counterarguments:\n- The author isn't physically cheating; he's just considering future actions. However, emotionally, he's being dishonest by not addressing the issue. The intent to pursue others while maintaining the relationship is problematic regardless of current actions.\n- The girl might not be in a monogamous relationship, but the author's post suggests she was previously in a relationship and now is with him. If there's an assumption of exclusivity, his actions violate that.\n\nIn conclusion, the author is in the wrong because he's not being transparent about his intentions, which can lead to emotional harm for the girl. The key issue is the lack of honesty and communication, which is essential in any relationship, especially one that's long-distance and emotionally charged.\n"
