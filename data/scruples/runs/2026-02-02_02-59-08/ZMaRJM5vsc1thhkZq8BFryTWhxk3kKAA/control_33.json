I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a long-distance relationship and the guy wanting to pursue other girls while keeping the existing one. Hmm.\n\nFirst, the guy met a girl online, and she became very attached. He was scared of her affection, then gave her the cold shoulder. Later, they reconnected, she told him she loves him, and they planned a visit. After meeting, he realized his feelings have grown but is worried about the future. Now he's considering pursuing other girls but doesn't want to cheat. \n\nWait, so he's in a relationship? The user says he's maintaining a long-distance relationship and wants to pursue other girls. The key here is whether the relationship is exclusive. If the girl is his girlfriend and they've agreed it's monogamous, then pursuing others would be cheating. But the post doesn't clearly state if they're in an official, exclusive relationship. He mentions she bought a train ticket to visit him, stayed in his room, had sex, and he's planning future visits. But does that mean they're in a committed relationship?\n\nHe also said he didn't say he loved her back but she was content. Maybe they're in a casual or open relationship? The user's intention is to keep the current girl while exploring others, but he's worried about becoming too close and not wanting to hurt her by breaking up. The problem is if the relationship is monogamous, then pursuing others is definitely wrong. But if it's non-exclusive, then maybe not. However, the user didn't mention discussing boundaries with her. If he's keeping her in the dark about his intentions to see others, that's deceitful. \n\nHe also mentioned he's trying to gain experience for his future \"real\" relationship. This suggests he's using her for practice, which is not respectful. Even if the relationship isn't exclusive, being honest is important. If he's not upfront about his intentions, he's leading her on. The fact that he's worried about hurting her if he breaks up now but doesn't want to, yet plans to pursue others, shows a lack of commitment and consideration for her feelings. \n\nSo, the main issue is honesty and commitment. If he's not upfront about his plans, he's being dishonest. Even if the relationship isn't exclusive, if she believes it is, he's misleading her. The answer hinges on whether the relationship is mutual and exclusive. Since the user hasn't clarified that, but the girl has shown strong affection and bought a ticket to visit, it seems she's invested. The author's intention to pursue others without her knowledge makes him the asshole because he's not being transparent, which is a key part of any healthy relationship.\n"
