I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The question is whether he's at fault for maintaining a long-distance relationship while pursuing other girls.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The author is in a long-distance relationship with a girl he met online. They haven't met until recently when she came to visit him. After spending time together, their relationship becomes more intimate. Now, he's feeling conflicted because his feelings have grown, but he's also trying to pursue other women to gain experience before settling down. He's worried about cheating if he continues this path.\n\nThe key points here are the definitions of cheating and emotional commitment. If the relationship was never clearly defined as exclusive, then technically he might not be cheating. However, if there were any unspoken expectations or mutual exclusivity, then pursuing others could be considered wrong. The author mentions he didn't reciprocate the love she expressed, but they were planning to meet and spent time together. This might imply a level of commitment, even if it's not formal.\n\nAnother angle is emotional manipulation. The author might be leading the girl on, making her believe there's potential for a future together while also looking elsewhere. That's ethically questionable because it could lead to her emotional harm if she's under the impression he's exclusive to her.\n\nThe author's justification is that he wants to gain experience before finding a serious partner. However, using someone for experience without being honest about intentions can be seen as exploitative. Even if he doesn't cheat, the act of emotionally engaging with her while considering others could be deceitful.\n\nThe line between casual and serious relationships is blurry here. If he didn't commit to being exclusive, maybe it's not cheating, but the emotional investment from her side complicates things. He might be taking advantage of her feelings without reciprocating fully, which can be harmful.\n\nIn conclusion, while the relationship might not be legally or explicitly cheating, the ethical aspect is murky. The author is likely leading the girl on without clear boundaries, which can hurt her. So, he's in the wrong because he's not being honest about his intentions and is potentially causing emotional harm.\n"
