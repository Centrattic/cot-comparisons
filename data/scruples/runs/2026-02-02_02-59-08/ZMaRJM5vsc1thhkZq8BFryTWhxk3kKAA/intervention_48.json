I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a guy in a long-distance relationship who's considering pursuing other girls while maintaining the current relationship. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The guy met a girl online, they talked for a while, she became attached, but he was scared and gave her the cold shoulder. Then after some time, they reconnected, she said she loved him, he didn't reciprocate, but they planned a meet-up. They spent time together, had a good time, and now he's feeling conflicted because he's worried about his growing feelings and the pressure to commit. He wants to keep the relationship but also wants to date other girls to gain experience for his future \"soulmate.\" He's worried about cheating if he continues.\n\nThe key points here are about honesty and commitment. If the relationship is exclusive, then pursuing other girls would be a breach of trust, making him the asshole. But if the relationship is non-exclusive, maybe it's different. However, the problem here is that he hasn't clarified the terms with the girl. She seems very attached and has invested emotionally, even buying a train ticket to visit him. He's aware that she's emotionally invested and might get hurt if he breaks up with her, but he's not ready to commit.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that he wants to gain experience to prepare for his future, but this approach is using the current relationship as a stepping stone. That's ethically questionable because it's not respecting the other person's feelings and the mutual expectations. Even if the relationship isn't official, if there's a mutual understanding of exclusivity, then pursuing others would be wrong. \n\nAlso, he's keeping her in the dark about his intentions. The girl has shown love, and he hasn't been forthright about his desire to pursue others. That's a setup for emotional harm. The author is prioritizing his own needs without considering the girl's feelings and the potential for hurting her. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is in the wrong because he's not being honest, is using the relationship as a means to gain experience, and is risking emotional harm to the girl by keeping her attached while planning to move on. The answer should be A.\n"
