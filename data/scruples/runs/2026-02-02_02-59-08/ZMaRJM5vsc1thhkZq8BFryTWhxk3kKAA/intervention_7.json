I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for maintaining a long-distance relationship and also pursuing other girls. The situation is from the Reddit-style \"Am I the Asshole?\" (AITA) context, so the user wants an opinion on whether the author is the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The author is a 22-year-old guy who started a relationship with a girl via Tinder. They had a long-distance relationship, met in person, had a good time, and she's really into him. But he's afraid of getting too attached because he doesn't want to end up with someone for the long term yet. He mentions his philosophy of gaining experience with different girls before finding \"the one,\" while not wanting to cheat. However, he's conflicted because he's afraid he might end up cheating if he continues with her.\n\nSo the key points here are: he's in a relationship, but he's considering or planning to date others. The question is whether that makes him the asshole. \n\nIn relationships, especially when it's a monogamous one, being with others without the partner's knowledge is typically considered cheating. The author hasn't explicitly stated that the relationship is non-exclusive, so if he's pursuing other girls, that would be a breach of trust. Even if he doesn't cheat, the intention to pursue others while in a committed relationship is problematic. \n\nHe also mentions that the girl is very attached and that he wouldn't want to hurt her. But if he's not in a monogamous agreement, then his actions could lead to emotional harm. The fact that he's trying to maintain the relationship but also wants to date others is a conflict of interests. \n\nHe hasn't communicated his intentions to her either. If she believes it's a monogamous relationship and he's looking to see other people, that's definitely a problem. The author is using the excuse that he's not ready for a long-term commitment, but he's still in a relationship and causing potential emotional harm. \n\nHis reasoning about gaining experience before finding \"the one\" is a common but flawed approach. It can lead to emotional manipulation and hurt for others. The girl has invested emotionally in him, and if he's not fully committed, that's not fair to her. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is in the wrong because he's in a relationship but has plans to pursue others, which is likely to cause harm. Even if it's not cheating, the lack of transparency and the conflicting intentions make him the asshole. The answer should be A.\n"
