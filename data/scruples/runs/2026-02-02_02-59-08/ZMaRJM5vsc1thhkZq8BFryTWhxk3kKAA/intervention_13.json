I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for maintaining a long-distance relationship while also pursuing other girls. The author is 22 and has a mindset that he wants to gain experience with different girls to not mess up with his future \"one.\" He's in a long-distance relationship where they met online, had a connection, met up, and she's very affectionate. Now he's afraid of getting too attached and wants to keep her while also pursuing others, which he doesn't want to consider cheating.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The key points are the long-distance aspect, the emotional attachment from the girl, the author's fear of getting too deep, and his desire to explore other relationships. The question is about whether he's in the wrong for wanting to do both.\n\nThe user's own opinion is that the author is in the wrong, but they want to confirm. I should evaluate based on concepts like honesty, commitment, and consent in relationships. In a long-distance relationship, especially one that's emotionally intense, there's an expectation of exclusivity unless otherwise agreed. The author is planning to pursue other girls, which would be infidelity if the relationship is monogamous. He hasn't explicitly discussed this with his partner, so there's a lack of consent. Even if he doesn't consider it cheating, the act of wanting to be in a relationship while also pursuing others without disclosure is deceptive. The partner is clearly emotionally invested, and the author is using the distance as a buffer to avoid commitment, which can be seen as manipulative. Therefore, the author is not being honest about his intentions, which is a breach of trust. So, the answer would be A.\n"
