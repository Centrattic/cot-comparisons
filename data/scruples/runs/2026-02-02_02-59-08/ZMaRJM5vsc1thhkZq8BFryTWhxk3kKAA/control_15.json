I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe author is a 22-year-old guy in a long-distance relationship with a girl he met on Tinder. They didn't meet in person for a while, and he was hesitant because he didn't feel she was that attached. Then, after some time, they reconnect, she expresses love, and they plan to meet. They have a good time, including intimacy, and he's now worried about his feelings growing stronger. He also wants to pursue other girls to gain experience for his future \"soulmate,\" but he's conflicted about cheating. The main question is whether he's wrong for wanting to keep the relationship while seeing others.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the nature of their relationship. The problem here is whether the relationship is monogamous. The author hasn't explicitly mentioned discussing boundaries with the girl. If they're in a monogamous relationship, then pursuing others would be a violation of that agreement, making him wrong. However, if it's an open or non-monogamous arrangement, then it might be acceptable, but the author doesn't mention that.\n\nThe key points here are communication and consent. The author says the girl bought a train ticket to visit him, stayed in his room, and they had sex. This suggests a level of intimacy and possibly a romantic or sexual relationship. If they didn't discuss the terms of the relationship (like exclusivity), then the author's plan to pursue others could be deceitful. \n\nAlso, the author acknowledges that he's in a position where he might hurt her if he breaks up now but doesn't want to. However, continuing the relationship while planning to pursue others without her knowledge could lead to emotional harm. The author's reasoning about gaining experience for a future partner is self-serving and doesn't consider the girl's feelings or the ethical implications of leading her on.\n\nEven if the author doesn't cheat, the act of pursuing others while in a relationship (assuming it's monogamous) is being unfaithful in intent, which can be emotionally damaging. The author's actions, while not physically cheating, could still be considered a betrayal of trust if the relationship is supposed to be exclusive.\n\nSo, unless the author and the girl have an open agreement, the author is in the wrong for wanting to maintain the relationship while pursuing others. The lack of communication about boundaries is a significant factor here. The author's self-justification doesn't negate the potential harm to the girl.\n"
