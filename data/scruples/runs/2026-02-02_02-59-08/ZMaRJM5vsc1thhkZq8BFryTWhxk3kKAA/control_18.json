I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to maintain a long-distance relationship while also pursuing other girls.\n\nFirst, the author met a girl online, and she became very attached even before they met. He then gave her the cold shoulder because he didn't want her to fall in love with him. Later, after some time apart, they reconnected and had a romantic encounter. Now, he's conflicted because he's developed feelings but doesn't want a serious long-term commitment. He also wants to pursue other relationships to gain experience before settling down.\n\nThe key issues here are honesty and consent. The author's intention to pursue other girls while in a relationship, even if it's long-distance, implies a lack of exclusivity. If the relationship isn't defined as non-exclusive, then pursuing others without the partner's knowledge or consent is a problem. The author mentions they plan to meet again, which might suggest a more committed setup. However, the author's own uncertainty about future commitment and desire for multiple partners could be a red flag.\n\nThe question is about whether the author is in the wrong. If the relationship is monogamous (which is the default unless stated otherwise), then the author is being dishonest by planning to pursue others. Even if the relationship isn't formalized, if the partner believes it's exclusive, the author is still being deceptive. The author's intention to avoid commitment and seek multiple partners could be seen as manipulative, especially if the other person is emotionally invested and possibly in a more serious position (like being in a relationship at one point, as mentioned).\n\nSo, the answer would lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because they are engaging in a relationship with a person who is clearly emotionally attached, and planning to pursue others without transparency. This could lead to emotional harm, and it's not ethical to maintain a relationship with someone under false pretenses of exclusivity when you're planning to pursue others. The author's justification about wanting experience doesn't absolve the dishonesty involved.\n"
