I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is in a long-distance relationship and considering pursuing other girls. He's aware that the girl he's with is really into him and he's worried about his feelings growing too strong, leading to potential cheating. He also mentions a past where he gave her the cold shoulder because he was scared of her falling for him. Now, after some time and a meet-up, he's feeling conflicted.\n\nFirst, the ethical aspect here. If he's in a relationship, even if it's long-distance, pursuing others could be seen as dishonest or a breach of trust. But the user is asking if he's in the wrong. The key points are: he hasn't committed to a monogamous relationship, maybe? Wait, he started a LDR, but then later he's considering pursuing others. But he's not clear if the current relationship is exclusive. The original post says he's \"keeping a long distance relationship and also pursuing other girls.\" If the relationship isn't exclusive, then maybe it's not wrong. But if it's implied that it is exclusive, then he's in the wrong.\n\nHe also mentions she said she loves him, and he didn't reciprocate. So maybe the relationship is not serious? But they had a meet-up, shared intimate moments, and he's now worried about his feelings. He's trying to balance between not wanting to commit fully and not wanting to hurt her by breaking up. However, if he's already in a relationship and plans to be with others, that's problematic. The fact that he's considering breaking up later might be worse because it's a betrayal once the trust is there.\n\nAnother angle: he's 22, trying to gain experience for the future. But if he's in a relationship, even if not officially monogamous, the act of pursuing others while in a relationship is generally frowned upon. The question is whether he's being upfront. If he hasn't established boundaries with her, then pursuing others while she's in love with him is deceitful. He's using her affection, which could be seen as manipulative. So the answer might be A (in the wrong) because he's not being honest with her about his intentions and is leading her on while planning to be with others. Even if he's not in a formal relationship, the emotional investment from her side means he's not being truthful about his own intentions. Therefore, he's in the wrong.\n"
