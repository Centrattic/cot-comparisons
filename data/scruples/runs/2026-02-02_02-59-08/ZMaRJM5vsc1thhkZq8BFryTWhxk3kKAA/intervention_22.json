I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a 22-year-old guy who's in a long-distance relationship but wants to pursue other girls. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The author met a girl online, they had a connection, but he wasn't sure about his feelings. After some time apart and reconnecting, they met up, had a nice time, and she's now affectionate towards him. He's worried about growing more attached and not wanting to break her heart, but he also wants to explore other relationships.\n\nThe main question is whether it's wrong to stay in the relationship while pursuing others. From a relationship standpoint, if both parties are not in agreement about exclusivity, then it's a problem. The author mentions that he's planning to meet her again but also wants to date others. If the relationship is monogamous, then pursuing others would be cheating. However, if they're in an open relationship, then it's okay. The author doesn't mention discussing this with her, so it's likely that she expects exclusivity. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that he's trying to gain experience before a long-term relationship. But using someone else's feelings to gain experience without being honest or upfront is unethical. Also, the girl has expressed love, which the author didn't reciprocate but didn't end the relationship. Keeping her in a situation where he's not fully committed and might not be honest about his intentions can be seen as manipulative or inconsiderate.\n\nAnother point is that the author is keeping her in the dark, not addressing the possibility of his own feelings changing or his need to explore other options. The girl might be emotionally invested, and the author is putting her in a position where she could get hurt. The author acknowledges the potential for cheating if he continues, which shows he's aware of the ethical issues but is trying to justify it through time.\n\nIn conclusion, the author is being dishonest about his intentions and is putting the girl in a vulnerable position. Even if he doesn't cheat now, the setup is risky and unfair to her. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong (A).\n"
