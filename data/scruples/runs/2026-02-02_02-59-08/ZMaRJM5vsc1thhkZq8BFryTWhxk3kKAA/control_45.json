I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong for maintaining a long-distance relationship while also pursuing other girls. The original poster (OP) is a 22-year-old guy who's been in a long-distance relationship with a girl he met on Tinder. They haven't met until recently, and after a three-day visit, his feelings have grown stronger. However, he's also thinking about pursuing other girls because he wants to gain experience for his future \"one.\" He's conflicted about whether he's being an asshole by not ending the relationship but also not being fully committed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the nature of their relationship. They started as a long-distance relationship through Tinder, which is typically for dating. The girl became very attached, and even though the OP initially gave her the cold shoulder, they reconnected later. She expressed love, and he didn't reciprocate but explained why. They had plans to meet, and after the visit, he feels pressure because of his growing feelings and his desire to date others.\n\nThe key points here are communication and honesty. The OP hasn't been clear about his intentions. If he's in a relationship but is planning to pursue other girls, that's a problem unless it's an open relationship, which they haven't discussed. The fact that he's keeping her in the relationship while also looking to date others without her knowledge is deceptive. The OP is aware that he might cheat if he continues, which indicates he's not being honest with her. Even though he doesn't want to hurt her by breaking up, his current actions are leading towards emotional harm if the relationship continues without transparency.\n\nAlso, the girl's feelings are significant here. She's invested emotionally, bought a train ticket, stayed in his room, and expressed love. If the OP isn't fully committed and is planning to pursue others, even if he's not cheating yet, it's still a setup for betrayal. The OP's justification about gaining experience for his future is selfish and doesn't consider her feelings or the current relationship's validity.\n\nIn most relationships, especially in a long-distance one where emotional intimacy is high, exclusivity is expected unless otherwise agreed. The OP's behavior is dishonest because he's not upfront about his intentions. Even if he's not physically cheating, emotionally, he's leading her on. So, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because he's being deceptive and not honest about his intentions, which can lead to emotional harm for the girl.\n"
