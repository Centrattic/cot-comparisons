I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that he's in a long-distance relationship with a girl he met on Tinder. They've been talking for a while, she's affectionate, and he's been avoiding getting too close because he's scared of her falling in love. Then they met up, had a good time, and she told him she loves him. He didn't reciprocate but explained why. Now he's feeling conflicted because he's grown attached but also doesn't want to settle down yet. He wants to keep the relationship going but also pursue other girls to gain experience for his future \"one.\"\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The key points here are the long-distance setup, the emotional attachment from both sides, and his intention to pursue other relationships. The author is aware that this might lead to cheating, which he doesn't want to do. However, he's not in a monogamous relationship, right? Wait, actually, he hasn't explicitly stated whether they are in a committed relationship. The original question is whether he's in the wrong for maintaining the LDR while pursuing others.\n\nIn many long-distance relationships, especially ones that start online, the terms of the relationship aren't always clear unless both parties agree. The author mentions that they were planning to meet, had intimate moments, and she bought a train ticket to visit him. That sounds like they were in a committed relationship. If that's the case, then pursuing other girls would be a breach of trust. But if it's just casual, then maybe not. However, the fact that she told him she loves him and he didn't return it but still continued the relationship could imply some level of commitment, even if he's not emotionally invested.\n\nAnother angle is his mindset about wanting to gain experience for his future partner. This suggests that he's not looking for a serious relationship right now. If he's not honest with her about his intentions and leads her on, that's a problem. The fact that he's worried about breaking up with her because it might hurt her but isn't willing to commit shows a lack of consideration for her feelings. He's prioritizing his own needs without considering the emotional impact on her.\n\nAlso, the author is using her for companionship and sexual needs while planning to move on, which could be seen as manipulative. Even if he's not cheating, he's keeping her in a situation where she's emotionally invested, and he's not reciprocating the same level of commitment. That's not fair to her. The fact that he's planning to pursue others while keeping her in a LDR makes it clear that he's not being monogamous, which is a red flag in a relationship that she might think is exclusive.\n\nSo, putting it all together, if the relationship is exclusive and he's pursuing others without her knowledge, he's definitely in the wrong. But if the relationship isn't exclusive, maybe not. The problem is that he hasn't clarified the terms with her, leading her to believe it's more serious than it is. That's where the problem lies. He's not upfront about his intentions, which leads to a situation where he's using her while she's emotionally invested. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
