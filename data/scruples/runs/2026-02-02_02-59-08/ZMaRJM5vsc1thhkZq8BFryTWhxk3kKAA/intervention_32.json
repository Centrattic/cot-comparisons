I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for maintaining a long-distance relationship while pursuing other girls. The key points here are about honesty, commitment, and emotional impact.\n\nFirst, the author met a girl on Tinder, and they built a relationship without meeting in person. She became very attached, but he felt scared and started to pull away. Then, after some time, they reconnect, she expresses love, and they plan a visit. They have a good time, and he feels his feelings are growing but also fears getting too close. He mentions he wants to gain experience with other girls so he's ready for the \"one,\" but doesn't want to cheat.\n\nNow, the main issue is whether it's wrong to be in a relationship and pursue others. If the relationship is monogamous and he's considering pursuing others, that's a problem. But if the relationship is consensually non-monogamous, then maybe not. However, the author hasn't mentioned discussing this with his partner. He's planning to keep her while also seeking others, which sounds like infidelity if not agreed upon. \n\nAlso, he's worried about breaking up with her because he doesn't want to hurt her. That suggests he's aware of the emotional impact but is still considering it. The fact that he's not being upfront with her about his intentions means he's not being honest, which is a key part of a healthy relationship. \n\nEven if he's not cheating yet, the intent to pursue others while in a relationship is a form of dishonesty. The partner has invested time and emotion, and he's using her for experience while not committing fully. That's unfair to her. The author might not see it as wrong because he doesn't want to hurt her, but the act of pursuing others without transparency is unethical. So, the answer is A (Yes, he's in the wrong).\n"
