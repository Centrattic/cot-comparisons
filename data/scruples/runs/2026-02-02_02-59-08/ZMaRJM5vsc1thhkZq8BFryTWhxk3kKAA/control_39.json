I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a long-distance relationship where the guy is maintaining it while also considering pursuing other girls. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the key points. The guy met a girl online, they had a connection, but he was hesitant because he didn't feel the same level of affection. After some time, she became attached again, and they met in person. Now, he's conflicted because he's developed feelings but also doesn't think she's the one for the long term. He's worried about being in a long-distance relationship and possibly cheating if he continues seeing others.\n\nThe main question is whether it's wrong for him to stay in this relationship while pursuing others. The user is asking if the author is the asshole (A) or not (B). \n\nIn relationships, honesty and commitment are usually important. If the guy is in a relationship, even a long-distance one, and he's considering pursuing other people, that could be seen as a breach of trust. However, the situation isn't clear on whether they are officially in a monogamous relationship. The initial interactions were online, and he was cold towards her before. Now, after meeting and having a physical relationship, he's unsure about his feelings.\n\nThe user's reasoning is that he's trying to gain experience for the future \"one,\" but that's a common justification for non-monogamy. However, if the relationship is supposed to be exclusive, then pursuing others would be wrong. The problem here is that the author hasn't made his intentions clear. If he's not committed to exclusivity, he's misleading her. Even if they aren't in an official relationship, after meeting and having an intimate connection, continuing to pursue others might be hurtful.\n\nAlso, the girl expressed love for him, and he didn't reciprocate. Keeping her in a situation where she's emotionally invested while he's looking elsewhere could be considered manipulative. The author is prioritizing his own needs without considering the emotional well-being of the other person. Even if he plans to break up after some time, the fact that he's not honest about his intentions could make him the asshole.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is in the wrong because he's not being honest about his intentions and is leading the girl on while planning to pursue others. The answer should be A.\n"
