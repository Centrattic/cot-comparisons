I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for maintaining a long-distance relationship while pursuing other girls. The author's main points are:\n\n1. They're in a long-distance relationship where they met online, had a connection, met in person, and she expressed love. He hasn't reciprocated but they're planning to meet again.\n2. He's considering pursuing other girls to gain experience for his \"future soulmate\" but doesn't want to cheat.\n3. He's conflicted because he doesn't want to hurt her, but he feels pressure and growth in feelings might lead to a breakup.\n\nSo, the key issue is whether he's being dishonest. He's in a relationship (even if not exclusive), and he's planning to pursue others. The question is about being in the wrong, which usually relates to ethical or moral standards.\n\nIn most relationships, especially when a partner expresses love and there's physical intimacy, the expectation is monogamy unless otherwise agreed. The author hasn't set boundaries with the girl about being non-exclusive. By pursuing others, he's not being truthful about his intentions, which could be considered deceitful. Even if he doesn't cheat, the act of pursuing others while in a relationship (even LDR) can be seen as a breach of trust.\n\nHe also acknowledges the potential for future hurt, which shows he's aware of the risks but is choosing to proceed. This self-awareness might make it worse because he knows the consequences but is still acting in a way that could harm her.\n\nTherefore, the author is in the wrong because he's not being honest about his intentions and is setting himself up to potentially hurt his current partner by pursuing others.\n"
