I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again to make sure I understand all the details.\n\nThe author is a 22-year-old guy in a long-distance relationship with a girl he met on Tinder. They didn't meet for a long time, but she became very attached to him, which made him uncomfortable. He started giving her the cold shoulder because he was afraid she'd fall in love with him. Then, after some time, he reconnects with her, they talk a lot, and she ends up staying with him for three days. They have a good time, including intimacy. Now, he's feeling conflicted because his feelings have grown, but he's worried about being in a long-distance relationship and the pressure. He also mentions he wants to gain experience with other girls to prepare for his future \"one,\" but doesn't want to cheat. The question is whether he's in the wrong for wanting to maintain this relationship while pursuing others.\n\nFirst, I should consider the basics of relationships and honesty. The author is in a relationship, even if it's long-distance. If he's planning to be with other people, that's typically considered cheating unless both parties are okay with it. However, the author hasn't communicated this to the girl. He also mentions that she's fun and he enjoys her company but doesn't see her as a future partner. If he's not committed to her long-term and is planning to date others, that's a problem because it's a betrayal of trust. \n\nThe key points here are communication and consent. If the relationship is supposed to be monogamous, then pursuing others without her knowing is definitely wrong. The author hasn't mentioned discussing boundaries with her. Even if they didn't have a formal commitment, long-distance relationships often require a level of exclusivity. The fact that he's considering pursuing others while in a relationship suggests he's not being honest. \n\nMoreover, he's aware that breaking up now would hurt her, but he's not willing to end it. That's a sign of emotional manipulation or at least a lack of consideration. He's keeping her in a situation where she's investing emotionally, while he's planning to move on. That's unfair. \n\nThe author's justification is that he's trying to gain experience before finding \"the one.\" But that's a flawed reasoning because it's not the girl's responsibility to be part of his preparation. Relationships should be about mutual respect and honesty. If he can't commit and is planning to see others, he should end things now to avoid leading her on. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because he's in a relationship and planning to pursue others without being honest, which is a breach of trust and respect.\n"
