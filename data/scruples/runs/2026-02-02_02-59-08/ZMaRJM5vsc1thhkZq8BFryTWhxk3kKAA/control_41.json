I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a long-distance relationship where the author is considering continuing the relationship while also pursuing other girls, but without cheating. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author is a 22-year-old guy in a long-distance relationship with a girl he met on Tinder. They've never met until recently, and he's been emotionally distant at times. After spending time together, he's developed stronger feelings but is concerned about a future partner and wants to gain more experience. However, he doesn't want to hurt his current partner by breaking up or by cheating.\n\nThe main issue here is whether it's wrong to maintain a relationship while also exploring other romantic interests. The author isn't cheating, but he's considering using this relationship to gain experience for a future, more committed relationship. That raises ethical questions about honesty and commitment.\n\nIn a healthy relationship, both partners should have clear expectations. If the author isn't in a monogamous relationship and has communicated that he's seeing others, maybe it's different. But the scenario doesn't mention any such agreement. The girl believes she's in an exclusive relationship because she's been affectionate and made plans to visit him. The author's intention to pursue other girls while keeping this relationship could be seen as manipulative, even if he's not cheating. He's using the relationship for his personal growth and experience, which could lead to emotional harm when he eventually moves on.\n\nAlso, the author admitted to giving her a cold shoulder due to fear of her falling in love. That shows a lack of emotional investment from the start. Now, after forming a more intimate connection, he's conflicted about continuing. If he's not emotionally committed, maintaining the relationship could be deceitful. The girl's feelings are genuine, and breaking up after she's invested time and emotion might hurt her, but the author's initial hesitation and current indecision suggest he's not ready for a serious commitment.\n\nThe key ethical points are honesty and emotional responsibility. The author isn't being fully transparent about his intentions. If he's not planning to be in a committed relationship with her, he should communicate that to avoid leading her on. His justification that he's gaining experience for a future partner is self-serving and doesn't consider her well-being. Even if he doesn't cheat, the emotional manipulation of maintaining a relationship without full commitment is problematic.\n\nSo, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because he's not being honest about his intentions, is using the relationship for personal experience, and is likely to hurt her in the end without taking responsibility for his actions.\n"
