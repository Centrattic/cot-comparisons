I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this relationship scenario is in the wrong. Let me read through the details carefully.\n\nThe author is a 22-year-old guy who started a long-distance relationship with a girl he met on Tinder. They didn't meet for a while, and he was hesitant because she became very attached. After some time, they reconnect, she visits him, and they spend time together, including having sex. Now, he's feeling conflicted because he's developed deeper feelings and is worried about the long-distance aspect. Additionally, he wants to continue seeing other girls for experience before finding his \"soulmate,\" but he doesn't want to cheat. He's torn between not wanting to hurt her by breaking up and not wanting to be in a serious relationship yet.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if he's being dishonest or deceptive. He mentions that he's keeping the relationship going but also wants to pursue others. If he hasn't told her about his intentions to see other people, that could be a problem. In many relationships, even long-distance, honesty is key. If he's leading her to believe they're in a monogamous relationship while he's planning to see others, that would be a betrayal of trust.\n\nHe also says he doesn't want to break up with her because he doesn't want to hurt her, but he's not sure if he can commit. That's a common dilemma, but it's important to consider her feelings and whether she's aware of his intentions. If she believes they're an exclusive couple and he's not being upfront about his desire to date others, that's a problem.\n\nAnother point is the long-distance aspect. They're planning to meet periodically, but he's worried about the feelings growing more when they're apart. If he's not committed, this could lead to emotional harm for her when the relationship eventually ends.\n\nThe user is asking if he's in the wrong. The key factors here are honesty and commitment levels. If he hasn't communicated his intentions to her, he's not being truthful, which can make him responsible for her potential heartbreak. Even if he doesn't want to cheat, pursuing other relationships while she's in a monogamous mindset would be unethical.\n\nAlso, the fact that she has a history of being attached and he was initially afraid of her affection might indicate that he's aware of her emotional state. Continuing the relationship under these circumstances without being honest about his own intentions could be seen as manipulative or inconsiderate.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is likely in the wrong because he's not being transparent about his intentions to pursue other relationships while maintaining a romantic connection with her. This lack of honesty can lead to emotional harm, and he's using her for experience rather than considering her feelings and the nature of their relationship.\n"
