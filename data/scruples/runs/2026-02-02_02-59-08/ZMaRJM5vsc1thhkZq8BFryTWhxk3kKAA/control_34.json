I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a guy in a long-distance relationship who's considering pursuing other girls while maintaining the current relationship. \n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The author met a girl online, had a connection, but pulled away because he was scared of her attachment. Then, they reconnected later, had a romantic encounter, and now he's feeling conflicted. He's grown closer to her but is worried about future commitment and wants to gain experience with other girls without cheating. \n\nThe key points here are: the relationship's status, communication, and intentions. The author hasn't explicitly mentioned if the relationship is monogamous. If it's not, then maybe it's not wrong. But if it is, then pursuing others could be a problem. However, the author is considering breaking up to avoid hurting her, which shows some level of care.\n\nBut the main issue is whether it's ethical to stay in a relationship while pursuing others. If the relationship is exclusive, then that's cheating. However, the author might not have set clear boundaries. The original post mentions he's unsure if he's an asshole, which indicates he's aware of potential wrongness. \n\nAlso, the author hasn't confirmed if the girl is still with her previous boyfriend. Wait, the timeline says she had a boyfriend in between, but he thought she still had one when he reached out. That could be a red flag if he knew or should have known she was in a relationship. But he says he thought she still had a boyfriend but decided to contact her anyway. That part might be problematic if she was in a relationship at the time.\n\nBut the main question is his current intentions. He's in a situation where he's seeing her, planning visits, and considering pursuing others. If the relationship is supposed to be monogamous, that's a breach. If it's open or non-monogamous, then maybe not. However, the author hasn't discussed this with her. The problem is his internal conflict: he's afraid of commitment and wants to explore other options without being dishonest. \n\nThe answer depends on whether the relationship is exclusive. Since the author hasn't clarified that, but the girl expressed love and they were planning to meet, it's likely expected to be monogamous. Therefore, pursuing others without her knowledge would be in the wrong. The author is being dishonest if he's not upfront about his intentions. Even if he plans to break up later, the act of pursuing others while in a relationship is deceptive and could be considered wrong. \n\nSo the answer would be A (Yes, he's in the wrong) because he's not being truthful about his intentions and is considering cheating, which is unethical in a presumably monogamous relationship.\n"
