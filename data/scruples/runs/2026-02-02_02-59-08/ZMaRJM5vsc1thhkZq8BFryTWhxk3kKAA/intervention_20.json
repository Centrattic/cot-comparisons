I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. The author is in a long-distance relationship and also considering pursuing other girls. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author met a girl online, they had a long-distance relationship, met up, and things were great. The author now feels conflicted because they don't want to commit fully but also don't want to hurt her. They mention wanting to gain experience with other girls before finding their \"one.\"\n\nThe main issue here is whether the author is being deceptive or emotionally manipulative. If the author is in a relationship, even a long-distance one, and is considering pursuing others, that's typically considered a breach of trust. But the situation is a bit ambiguous because the author hasn't explicitly labeled the relationship. They met online, had a connection, met up, but the author hasn't committed to a monogamous relationship. \n\nWait, the author says they didn't say they love her back, but they were planning to meet and spent time together. The girl said she loves him, so maybe she sees it as a serious relationship. The author, on the other hand, is unsure and wants to date others. That could be emotionally exploitative because the girl is invested, and the author might not be fully honest about their intentions.\n\nAlso, the author mentions they haven't broken up with her but are keeping her waiting while considering others. That could lead to emotional harm if they eventually leave. Even if the relationship isn't officially monogamous, the author's intent to pursue others without her knowledge might be wrong. \n\nIn most relationships, even informal ones, honesty is key. If the author isn't upfront about their intentions to date others, that's a problem. They might be leading her on and not being transparent, which is unethical. So, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because they're not being honest and are potentially emotionally manipulating the girl.\n"
