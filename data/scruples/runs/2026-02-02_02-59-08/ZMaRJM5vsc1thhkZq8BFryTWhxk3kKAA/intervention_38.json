I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a long-distance relationship where the author is considering pursuing other girls while maintaining the current relationship. Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, the author met a girl online, and she became very attached. He felt scared of her attachment and pulled away. Then, after some time, they reconnect, she expresses love, and they meet up. After their meeting, he feels more attached but also has reservations about committing. He mentions his goal of gaining experience with different girls to prepare for a future serious relationship, but he doesn't want to cheat. However, he's worried he might if he continues the current relationship.\n\nThe key point here is whether the author is being dishonest or deceptive in the current relationship. If he's in a relationship with this girl and is simultaneously pursuing others, that's typically considered cheating, which is a breach of trust. Even if he's not physically cheating, emotionally investing in others while in a relationship can be problematic. The girl has shown significant emotional investment and even confessed her love, so the author's intention to pursue others while keeping her might be seen as leading her on. The author also acknowledges the pressure he's putting himself under, but that doesn't excuse potentially misleading behavior towards the girl. If the author isn't ready for a committed relationship, it might be better to be honest from the start rather than allowing things to progress emotionally. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong because he's not being truthful about his intentions, which can hurt the girl when she's emotionally invested.\n"
