I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is a long-distance relationship where the author is considering pursuing other girls while maintaining the current relationship. \n\nFirst, the author met a girl on Tinder a year ago, and she became very attached even though they never met. He started giving her the cold shoulder because he was scared she'd fall in love with him. Then, after some time, they reconnect, meet up, and have a great time. Now, he's worried about the distance and his growing feelings, but he also wants to gain experience with other girls before finding his \"soulmate.\" He doesn't want to cheat but feels he might if he keeps the current relationship.\n\nSo, the key issue here is whether it's okay to be in a relationship while pursuing others. If the author is in a committed relationship, even if it's long-distance, then pursuing others could be considered cheating or at least emotionally dishonest. But the problem is, the author isn't sure if this is a committed relationship. The girl said she loves him, and they were planning to meet up, but the author hasn't committed to her either. \n\nWait, the author didn't say he reciprocated her feelings. He told her he couldn't say he loved her, but they were still planning to meet. So maybe their relationship isn't officially defined. If they're not in a monogamous relationship, then maybe the author isn't in the wrong. But if they were implied to be a couple, then pursuing others could be problematic. \n\nAlso, the author is concerned about hurting her if he breaks up, but he's also not ready to be fully committed. That could be seen as leading her on. The girl might believe there's a future with him, even if he's not sure. So, by continuing the relationship while looking for others, he might be emotionally manipulating her, which would be wrong. \n\nOn the other hand, if the author is being honest with himself and the girl about his intentions, maybe it's not wrong. But the author hasn't mentioned discussing boundaries with her. The question is whether the author is being deceptive. If he's leading her to believe there's exclusivity when he's not, then yes, he's in the wrong. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author is keeping the girl in a situation where he's not fully committed and is planning to pursue others, which could be emotionally harmful. Therefore, the answer is A: the author is in the wrong.\n"
