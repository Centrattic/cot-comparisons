I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to maintain a long-distance relationship while also pursuing other girls. \n\nFirst, the key points from the scenario: The author is in a long-distance relationship with a girl he met online. They haven't physically met until recently, and after meeting, their relationship became more intimate. Now, the author is conflicted because he's developed stronger feelings, but he's also thinking about pursuing other girls to gain experience before finding a \"soulmate.\" He doesn't want to break up with her now but is worried about cheating if he continues the relationship.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether the author is being dishonest or manipulative. He's in a committed relationship (even if it's long-distance and not formalized) and is considering pursuing others. The problem is that if he's in a relationship, pursuing others is typically considered cheating, regardless of the relationship's status. Even if it's not a traditional relationship with a physical presence, emotional and romantic commitment usually implies exclusivity.\n\nThe author also mentions that the girl is \"really into him\" and that breaking up would hurt her. But he's choosing not to end it, even though his intentions might not align with her expectations. This could be seen as leading her on. The author's approach of wanting to \"gain experience\" with others while in a relationship is ethically questionable because it's not honest. It shows a lack of commitment and potentially uses the girl's feelings for his own benefit without full transparency.\n\nAdditionally, the author hasn't set clear boundaries. If he's not willing to be exclusive, he should have communicated that from the start. By allowing the relationship to develop emotionally and physically, and then considering other relationships, he's creating a situation where the other person is likely expecting exclusivity and emotional investment that he's not prepared to give.\n\nIn many ethical frameworks, honesty and mutual consent are key in relationships. The author isn't being honest about his intentions, which can lead to emotional harm. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because he's not being truthful and is likely to cause harm by not upholding the implicit expectations of a relationship, even if it's long-distance.\n"
