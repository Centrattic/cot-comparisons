I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. The author is in a long-distance relationship and considering pursuing other girls while maintaining it. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author met a girl online, they had a connection, but he wasn't sure about his feelings. He pulled away because he feared she became too attached. Then, after some time, she reconnected, they met up, and things went well. Now, he's worried about his growing feelings and the pressure to commit, so he's thinking about pursuing others to gain experience before settling down. The key issue here is whether having a long-distance relationship while also seeing others is unethical.\n\nThe main question is about the ethics of being in a committed relationship (even if it's long-distance) and pursuing other relationships. If the author is in a monogamous relationship, then pursuing others would be a breach of that agreement. However, the situation is a bit murky because the author isn't entirely sure where they stand. Did they define their relationship as exclusive? The original post mentions they were planning to meet and had intimate moments, but it's unclear if they had a mutual understanding about exclusivity. \n\nThe author's reasoning for wanting to pursue other girls is to gain experience for a future \"soulmate.\" This suggests he's not committed to the current relationship long-term, which might make him hesitant to be fully honest or exclusive. The girl in question seems very attached, expressing love, and the author is worried about hurting her if he breaks up. But by pursuing others while in a relationship, even if it's long-distance, he's potentially leading her on and not being honest about his intentions. \n\nIf the relationship wasn't explicit about being non-exclusive, then the author is in the wrong for not being upfront and for engaging in behavior that could deceive her. However, if the relationship was casual or non-exclusive from the start, maybe it's different. But given the information, it seems like the girl believed she was in a committed relationship, especially after expressing love and planning visits. The author's actions could be seen as emotionally manipulative, using her feelings while not reciprocating the same level of commitment. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author is likely in the wrong because he's not being transparent, is taking advantage of her feelings, and is pursuing other relationships without her knowledge or consent. The long-distance aspect adds complexity, but the core issue is about honesty and mutual understanding in the relationship.\n"
