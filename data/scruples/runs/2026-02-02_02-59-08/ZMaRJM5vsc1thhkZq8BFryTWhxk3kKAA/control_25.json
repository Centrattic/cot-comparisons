I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this situation is in the wrong. The author is in a long-distance relationship but also wants to pursue other girls. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author had a previous situation where a girl became very attached to him, which he found uncomfortable. Now, he's in a similar dynamic with another girl. The key issue here is whether he's being truthful about his intentions. He's keeping the relationship going but not committing fully, possibly to avoid hurting her now. But he's planning to pursue others. \n\nLooking at the details: he hasn't told her he loves her, but they've had a lot of intimate moments. He's meeting her in person, which is a big step. If he's not committed, then being in a physical relationship while seeing others is a problem. The girl is clearly emotionally invested, and he's holding her in a state of uncertainty. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that he wants to gain experience before settling down. But if he's in a relationship, even long-distance, and he's not being honest about his intentions, that's not fair to her. He's creating a bond and then considering moving on, which would hurt her. The fact that he's already planning to pursue others while in this relationship suggests he's being deceptive. \n\nEven if he hasn't broken up with her yet, maintaining a relationship without full commitment while pursuing others is generally considered unethical. The girl has invested time and emotion, and he's not being upfront. So yes, the author is in the wrong because he's not being honest and is leading her on.\n"
