I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that he's in a long-distance relationship with a girl he met online. They've been talking for a while, she became very attached, and he started pulling away because he didn't want her to fall in love with him. They eventually met up, had a good time, and she told him she loves him. He didn't say it back but explained why. Now, after she left, he's conflicted because his feelings have grown more, but he's also thinking about pursuing other girls to gain experience for his future \"one.\"\n\nHmm, first thing to consider is the nature of the relationship. He's been in a long-distance one, and they met in person. If they are in a committed relationship, then pursuing other girls would be a problem. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. The key points here are communication and mutual understanding. Did they discuss the boundaries of their relationship? If he's in a monogamous relationship and he's considering pursuing others, that's cheating and he would be in the wrong. But if the relationship isn't defined as exclusive, maybe it's different. \n\nThe user mentions that he's been in a long-distance relationship where she bought a train ticket to visit him. It seems like she's invested a lot, and he's now unsure about his feelings. He's afraid of hurting her if he breaks up, but he also doesn't want to commit fully. If he's not honest with her about his intentions, that's a problem. If he's leading her on or not clear about his expectations, that's being inconsiderate. \n\nAlso, his mentality about wanting experience before the \"one\" is a red flag. It sounds like he's not ready for a committed relationship and is using this as a way to gain experience without being upfront. If he's not in a committed relationship, maybe it's his choice, but the way he's acting could be manipulative. Since he's planning to pursue others while being with her, that's a conflict if she expects exclusivity. \n\nHe might not have explicitly stated the terms of the relationship, so maybe she thinks it's exclusive while he's considering it as a casual or non-exclusive one. That would be the problem. Without clear communication, he's not being honest, which can hurt her. So, even if the relationship isn't formalized, if he's leading her to believe they're in something serious and then plans to date others, that's being deceitful. \n\nIn conclusion, if the relationship is intended to be exclusive and he's not being upfront, then he's in the wrong. But if they never discussed exclusivity, maybe he's not. However, given the context, she's shown a lot of commitment (buying tickets, visiting him), which implies she sees it as more than casual. His hesitation to commit and his intention to pursue others while in this setup makes him the asshole because he's not being honest and is using her for experience, which is unfair to her.\n"
