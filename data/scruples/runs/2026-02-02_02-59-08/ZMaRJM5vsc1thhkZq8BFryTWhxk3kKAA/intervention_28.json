I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for maintaining a long-distance relationship while also pursuing other women. The author is 22 and has a mindset that he wants experience to not mess up his future \"one.\" He's in a relationship where they met online, had a lot of emotional and physical connection during a three-day visit. Now, after she left, he's feeling conflicted because he doesn't want to commit but also doesn't want to break her heart. He's considering pursuing other girls while still keeping this relationship.\n\nFirst, the key issue here is honesty and commitment. The author hasn't explicitly asked if the relationship is exclusive. If the relationship is not exclusive, then his actions might be okay. But if it's implied to be exclusive, then he's being dishonest by pursuing others. The problem is that the woman in the relationship has shown strong feelings, even saying she loves him. The author, however, isn't reciprocating the same level of commitment. He's using her for experience, which could be seen as using her emotionally. \n\nAlso, he's planning to meet again, which gives her the impression that the relationship is ongoing. If he's not fully committed and is looking to date others, that's a betrayal of trust. Even if he doesn't want to cheat, the fact that he's maintaining the relationship while seeking others is a form of emotional cheating. It's about setting boundaries and being truthful. If he's not ready for a committed relationship, he should communicate that, but instead, he's leading her on. \n\nThe author's reasoning about needing experience might be his justification, but it doesn't excuse the potential harm to the other person. The question is whether he's being deceptive or not. If the relationship isn't exclusive, then maybe not. But given the context, it seems like it's a monogamous relationship. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because he's not being honest about his intentions and is potentially leading her on while planning to pursue others. So the answer is A.\n"
