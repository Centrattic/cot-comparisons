I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person in the given situation is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the guy started a long-distance relationship with a girl he met on Tinder. They didn't meet for a while, and he kept her around even though he wasn't sure about his feelings. Then after reconnecting, they met up, had a good time, and she expressed love. He didn't reciprocate, but now he's conflicted because his feelings might be growing. He wants to continue the relationship but also wants to pursue other girls to gain experience for his future relationship. He's worried about cheating if he keeps things going with her.\n\nThe key points here are honesty and commitment. In a relationship, even if it's not exclusive, being upfront about your intentions is crucial. If the guy isn't in a monogamous relationship, he should clarify that. But the story suggests he's maintaining a relationship while planning to pursue others, which is a form of cheating if the relationship is supposed to be exclusive. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong for wanting to keep her while pursuing others. \n\nHe hasn't broken up with her yet, and he's aware that she might not be his future partner. His reasoning is that he wants experience. But without clear communication, he's leading her on. Even if their relationship isn't formal, if she believes it's exclusive, then he's being dishonest. The fact that she bought a ticket to visit him and the intimacy they shared (sex, etc.) implies a level of commitment. If he's not committed to being faithful, that's a problem. \n\nSo, even if he's not currently cheating, his intentions to pursue others while in a relationship (even if not official) could be seen as manipulative or inconsiderate. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, and based on the lack of communication and the potential for emotional harm, I agree. The answer should be A for Yes.\n"
