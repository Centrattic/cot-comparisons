I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The question is whether they should be considered the asshole for maintaining a long-distance relationship while also pursuing other girls. \n\nFirst, I need to parse the situation. The author is 22 and in a long-distance relationship with a girl they met on Tinder. They didn't initially feel the same level of affection she had, so they pulled away. Then, after some time, they reconnected, met up, had a good time, and she told him she loves him. He didn't reciprocate but explained why. They plan to meet again, and now he's feeling conflicted because he's developed stronger feelings but also wants to pursue other relationships to gain experience for his future \"soulmate.\"\n\nThe key points here are: Is he in a committed relationship? The post says she bought a train ticket to visit him, they stayed in his room, had sex, and he's considering pursuing other girls. If the relationship was supposed to be exclusive, then pursuing others would be a problem. However, the author hasn't explicitly stated that they agreed on exclusivity. But typically, when someone is in a relationship, even long-distance, there's an expectation of exclusivity unless otherwise stated.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that he wants to gain experience for his future partner, but that's not a valid justification for being emotionally or physically involved with others if the current relationship isn't open. Even if it's not officially exclusive, if the girl believes it is, then the author is misleading her. Also, he's aware that breaking up might hurt her, but he doesn't want to do that, so he's choosing to keep her while also pursuing others. That seems manipulative because he's keeping her in a situation where she's emotionally invested while he's not fully committed.\n\nAnother angle: The author is conflicted about his feelings. He says he doesn't want to break up with her because she's fun, but he doesn't see her as his future. Pursuing others while in a relationship is generally considered wrong because it's not honest. Even if the relationship isn't formalized, if there's an understanding of exclusivity, then pursuing others is a breach of trust.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because he's not being honest about his intentions and is leading the girl on while pursuing other relationships, which is a form of emotional dishonesty or manipulation.\n"
