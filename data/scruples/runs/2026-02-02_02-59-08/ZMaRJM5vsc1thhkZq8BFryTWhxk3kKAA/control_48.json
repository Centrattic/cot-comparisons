I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a long-distance relationship where the guy is also pursuing other girls. Let's break down the key points.\n\nFirst, the guy met a girl online, she became very attached, but he wasn't sure about her feelings. He gave her the cold shoulder because he was scared of her falling in love. Then after some time, they reconnect, she tells him she loves him, and they meet up. They spend three days together, have sex, and he starts to feel more attached. Now he's worried about their future because he's not sure if he can commit and wants to explore other relationships. His reasoning is that he wants experience to prepare for his future \"one.\" But he's also concerned about breaking her heart if he ends things now.\n\nSo, the main question is whether it's wrong to maintain a relationship with her while pursuing others. Let's consider the dynamics. The core issue here is about honesty and the nature of the relationship. The author hasn't explicitly stated that they're in a monogamous relationship. If they're not in a committed, monogamous relationship, then perhaps he's not in the wrong. However, the girl might have assumed exclusivity, especially since she told him she loves him and bought a train ticket to visit him. If the author is leading her on or not being transparent about his intentions, that could be problematic.\n\nThe key factors are:\n\n1. **Communication**: Did they discuss the relationship's boundaries? If he hasn't clarified that it's non-exclusive, and she's acting as if it's a serious relationship, then the author is being deceptive. If he's not honest about wanting to date others, that's a problem.\n\n2. **Intentions and Actions**: Even if they're not in a monogamous relationship, pursuing others while in a romantic connection can be seen as emotionally unavailable or manipulative. The girl's affection and commitment might not align with his, which could lead to her being hurt when he eventually leaves or if she expects exclusivity.\n\n3. **Emotional Impact**: The author acknowledges that breaking up might hurt her, but he's choosing to stay because he enjoys her company. This could be a form of emotional exploitation, where he's using her for companionship while planning to move on. That's ethically questionable.\n\n4. **His Justification**: The idea that he's gathering experience for future relationships is a common trope, but it's often used to rationalize inconsiderate behavior. It's important to recognize that others' feelings matter and shouldn't be secondary to personal goals.\n\nIn relationships, even casual ones, honesty about intentions is crucial. If the author isn't upfront with the girl about wanting to date others, he's not being transparent. Since she's invested emotionally (loved him, visited him, etc.), and he's aware of her attachment, maintaining a relationship with her while seeing others without her knowledge or consent could be considered wrong. It's about respecting her autonomy and making her an active partner in the relationship rather than a passive participant in his plans.\n"
