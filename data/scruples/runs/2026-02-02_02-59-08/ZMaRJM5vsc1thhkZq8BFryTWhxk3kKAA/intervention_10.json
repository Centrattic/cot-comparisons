I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this long post is in the wrong. The situation is about a long-distance relationship and the author's intentions to pursue other girls while maintaining it. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author, a 22-year-old guy, has been in an LDR with a girl he met on Tinder. They didn't meet for a while, but after reconnecting, they had a nice time together, including meeting in person. Now, he's feeling conflicted because he's developed stronger feelings but doesn't see her as a long-term partner. He wants to continue the relationship for now but also wants to \"get experience\" by pursuing other girls, to prepare for a future serious relationship. The main question is whether he's being dishonest or manipulative by keeping the current relationship while looking elsewhere.\n\nThe user's own opinion is that the author is in the wrong, but they're seeking others' perspectives. So I need to evaluate the ethics here. The big issue here is honesty and commitment. If the author is in a relationship, even a long-distance one, and is planning to pursue other people without being upfront, that's a problem. The fact that he hasn't even considered being transparent about his intentions with the girl he's already seeing is a red flag. \n\nThe author mentions that the girl is very affectionate and expressed her feelings (she said she loves him), but he didn't reciprocate. Now, he's enjoying the relationship but doesn't see her as the future. However, by continuing the relationship while planning to pursue others, he's setting himself up for potential emotional harm to her. The girl has already invested a lot, and if he's not committed, that's a form of emotional manipulation or at least a lack of honesty. \n\nEven though he says he doesn't want to cheat, the act of pursuing others while in a relationship (even if not exclusive initially) is still unethical if there's an expectation of monogamy. The author's reasoning that he's just gaining experience for the \"real\" relationship in the future doesn't excuse his actions. Relationships require mutual understanding and consent. If he's not interested in a monogamous commitment, he should have communicated that from the start. \n\nAnother point is the power dynamic. The girl has been more emotionally invested, especially after rekindling the connection and expressing her feelings. The author is taking advantage of her affection without being honest about his own intentions. This could lead to hurt feelings when she eventually finds out, even if he doesn't act on the pursuit of others immediately. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author is in the wrong because he's being dishonest and potentially leading the girl on without her knowledge, which is harmful. The answer should be A.\n"
