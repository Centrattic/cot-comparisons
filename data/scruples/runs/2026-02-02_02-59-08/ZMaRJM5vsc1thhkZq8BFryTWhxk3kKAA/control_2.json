I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for maintaining a long-distance relationship and pursuing other girls. The author is 22, met a girl on Tinder, had a connection, but was scared of her attachment. Then after some time, they reconnect, meet up, and have a great time. He's now worried about being in a relationship with her but also wanting to date others to gain experience before finding a \"soulmate.\" He doesn't want to cheat but feels he might if he continues. The main question is if he's the asshole for wanting to keep her while pursuing others.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author is in a long-distance relationship, which he has agreed to maintain. However, he's also planning to pursue other relationships. The key issue here is whether the relationship is monogamous. If it's not, then maybe it's okay, but usually, relationships are expected to be exclusive unless otherwise stated. The author didn't mention discussing boundaries with the girl, so it's likely she expects exclusivity. \n\nHe mentions they met up, had intimate moments, and she told him she loves him. If he's not in love yet but feels pressured, he might be in a situation where he's leading her on. Even if he's not cheating yet, the intention to pursue others while in a relationship can be problematic. It's important to consider consent and mutual understanding. If the girl believes they're exclusive and he's planning to see others, that's a breach of trust. \n\nThe author also says he's not an asshole, but his actions could be seen as such. The idea that he's building experience for a future relationship implies that this current one isn't serious from his perspective, which might not align with hers. The Tl;dr question is about whether it's wrong to keep her while pursuing others. In most cases, relationships require some level of exclusivity, so unless the partner is aware and okay with it, the author is being dishonest. \n\nHe also mentions not wanting to break up with her because it would hurt her, but this is a way to avoid confrontation. It's not fair to keep someone in a relationship if he's not committed to monogamy. The pressure he feels might be his own fear of commitment, but that doesn't justify leading her on. So, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because he's not being honest about his intentions and is potentially violating the expectations of the relationship.\n"
