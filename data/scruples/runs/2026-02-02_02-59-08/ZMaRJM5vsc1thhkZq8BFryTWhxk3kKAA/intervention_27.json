I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a long-distance relationship where the guy is still dating other people. \n\nFirst, the guy started a relationship with a girl he met on Tinder. She got very attached, and he pulled away because he was scared. Then after a while, they reconnect, she says she loves him, they meet, have sex, and he's into her but not in love. He's worried about growing more attached and wants to keep dating others to gain experience for his future \"soulmate.\" The question is whether he's in the wrong for maintaining the long-distance relationship while pursuing others.\n\nSo, the key points here. The main issue is whether he's being deceptive or dishonest. If they are in a monogamous relationship, then pursuing others would be a problem. But the question is if he's in the wrong. The guy doesn't mention that he's told her he's seeing others. If he hasn't, then he's being dishonest. Even if the relationship isn't officially monogamous, the fact that he's keeping it a secret might be the issue.\n\nAlso, the girl is very attached and he's worried about hurting her if he breaks up. But he's not breaking up; he's choosing to keep her while seeing others. That could be seen as using her, even if he doesn't cheat. Emotional honesty is important here. If he values her, he should be upfront about his intentions rather than leading her on.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that the guy is in the wrong. I agree because in a relationship, especially a long-distance one, emotional honesty is crucial. If he's not willing to commit and is seeing others, he should not be in a relationship with her. Even if it's not physical cheating, emotional cheating can still hurt. The guy is keeping her in the dark about his intentions, which is unfair. He should either be transparent and set boundaries or end it to avoid leading her on.\n"
