I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break down this situation. The user is a 22-year-old guy in a long-distance relationship with a girl he met on Tinder. They haven't met in person until recently, but she ended up visiting him and staying in his room. Now, he's feeling conflicted because he's fallen for her but isn't sure if she's his future partner. He wants to maintain the relationship but also wants to date other girls to gain experience for his \"one.\"\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. The main issue here is whether it's wrong to be in a relationship while pursuing others. If the relationship is exclusive, then pursuing other girls would be cheating, which is generally wrong. But the user hasn't made it clear if the relationship is exclusive. The girl said she loves him, and he didn't reciprocate, but they are planning to meet. However, after the visit, he's more attached but still wants to date others.\n\nAnother angle is consent and communication. If the girl is under the impression that the relationship is exclusive, then the user is in the wrong. If he hasn't clarified the terms, it's a problem. Also, the user is worried about hurting her if he breaks up, but he's choosing not to because he enjoys her company. That might be using her, which is unethical.\n\nThe user's reasoning is that he wants experience for his future partner. But that's a selfish motive. If the girl is in love and he's leading her on while seeing others, that's manipulative. Even if he doesn't plan to cheat, the act of pursuing others while in a relationship (even if not officially) is deceitful.\n\nAdditionally, the user hasn't been honest about his intentions. When the girl said she loves him, he didn't return it but didn't clarify if he was open to a non-exclusive arrangement. That lack of transparency is a red flag. The user is creating a situation where the girl is emotionally invested while he's not fully committed, which is unfair.\n\nIn conclusion, yes, the author is in the wrong because he's not being honest about his intentions and is potentially leading the girl on while pursuing others, which is a form of emotional manipulation and dishonesty.\n"
