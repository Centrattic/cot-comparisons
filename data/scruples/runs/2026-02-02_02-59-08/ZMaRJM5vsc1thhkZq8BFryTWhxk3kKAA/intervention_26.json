I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is about a long-distance relationship where the guy is continuing the relationship but also pursuing other girls. He mentioned he's in a shared house and they met for a visit, and now he's conflicted because he's grown feelings but doesn't want to commit.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The original question is \"Am I the asshole (AITA) for keeping a long-distance relationship while also pursuing other girls?\" The key points here are whether the author is being honest with his partner and if he's treating his partner respectfully.\n\nThe author explains that he's been in a relationship with this girl for a year, had a period where communication dwindled because he was scared of her falling in love, then reconnected. She confessed her love, he didn't reciprocate, but they continued a relationship. They met in person, and now he's considering that he might not want to commit but still wants to keep her around while also pursuing others.\n\nThe main ethical issue here is about honesty and emotional manipulation. If the author is not in love with her and is keeping her in a relationship while also seeing other people, that's a problem. Even if he's not physically cheating, emotionally he's not being truthful. The girl is clearly invested, and the author is leading her on without a clear commitment. This can hurt her emotionally, as the author himself acknowledges that breaking up might hurt her. However, keeping her in a state of uncertainty for potential future commitment while pursuing others is unethical.\n\nAnother angle is the concept of exclusivity. If the author is in a relationship, even a long-distance one, pursuing other people typically would be considered cheating unless both parties have agreed to an open relationship. The question is whether the author and his partner have discussed and agreed to non-exclusivity. The text doesn't mention that, so it's safe to assume it's a monogamous relationship by default. Therefore, the author is violating the terms of the relationship by seeking others, which makes him the asshole.\n\nAlso, the author's reasoning about gaining experience for future relationships is a bit self-centered. It's using the current partner for practice rather than a genuine relationship, which is unfair to her. She deserves a partner who is emotionally committed and truthful, not someone who's using her for experience.\n\nIn conclusion, the author is not upfront about his intentions and is keeping the girl in a situation where she's emotionally invested without a clear future. That's being in the wrong. So the answer should be A.\n"
