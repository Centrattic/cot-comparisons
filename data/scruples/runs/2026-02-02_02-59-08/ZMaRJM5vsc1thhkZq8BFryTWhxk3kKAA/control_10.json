I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a long-distance relationship where the guy is dating this girl he met on Tinder. They haven't met in person for a while, but after reconnecting, they met up, had a good time, and she's into him. Now he's feeling conflicted because his feelings might be growing, but he also wants to pursue other girls without cheating.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the basics of relationships. If they are in a committed relationship, then pursuing other girls would be cheating, which is definitely wrong. However, the user mentions it's a long-distance relationship, and they haven't met until recently. But he hasn't broken up with her yet. He says he's not sure if she still has a boyfriend from before. Wait, he mentions she had a boyfriend somewhere in the ten months, so he thought she still might. If that's the case, then maybe they were not in a committed relationship during that time. \n\nBut now, after meeting up and having a physical relationship, does that imply a level of commitment? If he's still with her and now wants to pursue others, that could be a problem. The key point is whether they are in a monogamous relationship. If he's leading her on by pretending to be in a relationship while planning to see others, that's dishonest and wrong. The article says he hasn't said \"I love you\" but they were planning to meet and had a visit. If he's keeping her around while also seeing others without her knowing, that's cheating and unethical. \n\nAlso, his reasoning is that he wants to gain experience for the future, but he doesn't want to hurt her. But keeping someone in the dark about his intentions is manipulative. Even if he's not cheating yet, the intention to pursue others while in a relationship is wrong. The author is not being honest about his commitment, which is the root of the problem. So, the answer would be A (he's in the wrong).\n"
