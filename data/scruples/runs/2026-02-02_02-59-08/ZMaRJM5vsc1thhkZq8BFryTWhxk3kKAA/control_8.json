I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. The author is in a long-distance relationship and is considering pursuing other girls while maintaining the current one. \n\nFirst, I need to figure out the key points here. The author met a girl on Tinder, they had a connection but he was scared of her getting too attached. He gave her the cold shoulder, then after some time, reconnected and they met up. Now, he's feeling pressure because his feelings might be growing, but he doesn't see her as a long-term partner. He wants to keep the relationship going while also pursuing others to gain experience before settling down. The question is whether this is wrong.\n\nSo, the main issue is about whether it's okay to be in a relationship with someone while seeing others. The author is in a long-distance relationship, which can be challenging. But he's also considering pursuing multiple partners. If he's in an exclusive relationship, then pursuing others would be a breach of that exclusivity, making him in the wrong. However, if the relationship is not exclusive, maybe it's different.\n\nLooking at the details: The author says he hasn't deleted her from Snapchat, and they planned a visit. After meeting, he's grown more attached but still doesn't see her as the future. He wants to continue the relationship but also pursue others to get experience. The problem is that if the relationship is supposed to be exclusive, then he's being deceptive. If it's non-exclusive, then maybe not. However, the original post mentions he's in a long-distance relationship but doesn't clarify if it's exclusive. The key here is that even if the relationship isn't exclusive, being honest with the partner is important. \n\nThe author hasn't mentioned discussing boundaries with the girl. If he's planning to see others without her knowledge, that's definitely wrong. But if they agreed on non-monogamy, then it's different. Since the post doesn't state that they've discussed this, it's likely the girl expects exclusivity. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because he's leading her on without being upfront about his intentions to pursue others. It's important to communicate and be honest about what the relationship entails. Also, using the excuse of wanting to gain experience for a future relationship doesn't justify potentially hurting someone else. The answer would be A.\n"
