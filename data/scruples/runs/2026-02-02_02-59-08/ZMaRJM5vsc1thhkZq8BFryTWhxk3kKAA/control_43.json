I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for maintaining a long-distance relationship while also pursuing other girls. The situation is a bit complex.\n\nFirst, the author and the girl started talking on Tinder, which is a dating app. They had a long-distance relationship, met up, had an intimate experience, and she's very attached. The author now feels conflicted because he's developed feelings but isn't ready to commit and wants to explore other relationships. He's worried about hurting her if he breaks up, but he also doesn't want to be in a relationship that might lead to cheating.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author is in a relationship, even if it's long-distance. He's considering pursuing others, which would be cheating unless there was prior agreement. The question is whether he's being dishonest or manipulating the situation.\n\nIn most relationships, exclusivity is implied unless otherwise stated. The author isn't being upfront about his intentions to pursue others. He's also hesitant to break up because he doesn't want to hurt her, but instead of being honest, he's choosing to keep her in the dark. That's a red flag. The girl is emotionally invested and has traveled to meet him, which shows her commitment. The author is using her affection to avoid making a decision, which is inconsiderate.\n\nAdditionally, the author's reasoning about gaining experience for a future \"one\" is a common but flawed rationale. It's using the girl as a means to an end, which isn't respectful. The fact that he's in a committed relationship with her but planning to pursue others suggests infidelity, which is generally considered wrong unless it's non-monogamous and consensual.\n\nTherefore, the author is being deceptive and is in the wrong because he's not being honest about his intentions and is leading the girl on without considering her feelings beyond his own.\n"
