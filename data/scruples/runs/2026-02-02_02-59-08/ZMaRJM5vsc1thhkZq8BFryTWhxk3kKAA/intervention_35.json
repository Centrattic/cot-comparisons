I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. The author is a guy in a long-distance relationship with a girl he met on Tinder. They haven't met until recently, and after spending time together, he feels his feelings have grown. However, he's considering pursuing other girls because he wants to gain experience for a future \"soulmate.\" He's worried about cheating or breaking her heart if he ends things.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The relationship is long-distance, and they haven't met before the recent visit. She's affectionate and expressed love, but he can't reciprocate. He's now thinking about pursuing others while keeping the relationship. The main issue is whether he's being deceptive or leading her on.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, if the relationship is supposed to be exclusive, and he's considering pursuing others while still being with her, that's a problem. Even if he doesn't want to cheat, his intention to seek other relationships while in a committed one (assuming it's exclusive) is dishonest. The girl has invested time and emotions, and he's not being transparent about his intentions. Leading someone on without clear communication can be harmful, especially if she believes the relationship is serious. The author's rationale about gaining experience for the \"right person\" might be a way to justify his actions, but it's still unethical to engage in a relationship with someone while planning to pursue others. The answer would likely be \"Yes, the author is in the wrong\" because he's not being honest and is setting up a situation where one person is being used for experience while the other is led on.\n"
