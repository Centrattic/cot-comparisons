I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves a long-distance relationship where the author is considering pursuing other girls while maintaining the current relationship. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author is 22, met a girl on Tinder, had a 2-month conversation where she became very attached. He then gave her the cold shoulder for 10 months, maybe due to fear of her falling in love. They met up recently, had a great time including sex, and now he's feeling pressured because his feelings might grow. He's thinking about pursuing other girls to gain experience for his future \"soulmate,\" but doesn't want to cheat. The question is whether he's wrong for wanting to keep the current relationship while also dating others.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether the author is being deceptive or unfair. If he's in a relationship with this girl, even a long-distance one, and he's pursuing others without her knowing, that's a red flag. But the post doesn't explicitly say he's in a monogamous relationship. He mentions they were planning to meet and that she was into him, but he never said he committed to her. \n\nHowever, when she told him she loves him, he didn't return the feelings but explained why. She seemed content. Then after the meetup, he's feeling conflicted. The problem is, if he's not in a monogamous agreement, then maybe it's not inherently wrong. But usually, when someone is in a relationship where the other person has expressed love, even if not reciprocated, it's expected to be honest about intentions. \n\nHe's using her to gain experience, which might not be respectful. Also, he's keeping her in the dark about his plans to pursue others, which can lead to emotional harm. The fact that he's not planning to break up but wants to take time to let things settle might be prolonging the inevitable. If he's not willing to commit, he should have been clear from the start. The girl might be getting emotionally invested, and he's toying with her feelings by not being upfront. \n\nSo, even if the relationship isn't formal, the author's actions could be seen as leading her on. The answer would likely be A (in the wrong) because he's not being honest and is potentially using her, which can be hurtful. The key is whether he's in a committed relationship. If not, maybe B. But since she expressed love and he didn't, but continued the relationship, he's in a gray area. However, pursuing others without her consent is still wrong. So A.\n"
