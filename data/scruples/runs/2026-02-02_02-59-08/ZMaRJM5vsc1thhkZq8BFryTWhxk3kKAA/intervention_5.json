I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the story is in the wrong for maintaining a long-distance relationship while also pursuing other girls. The key points here are about the nature of the relationship and the expectations both parties have. \n\nFirst, the author and the girl met on Tinder, had a two-month conversation without meeting, and she became very attached. The author wasn't sure about her feelings and gave her the cold shoulder because he feared she might fall in love. Then, after ten months, they reconnected, met in person, and had a good time. The girl told him she loves him, but he couldn't reciprocate the love, so he didn't. They planned to meet again soon.\n\nNow, the author is feeling conflicted because he's grown feelings for her after meeting but also wants to pursue other girls. He mentions his mentality of gaining experience to not \"fuck it all up\" with his future soulmate. The main question is whether it's wrong to keep the relationship going while seeing others.\n\nIn a committed relationship, even if it's long-distance, exclusivity is usually expected. If the author isn't in a monogamous agreement with the girl, then pursuing others might not be wrong. But if there's an unspoken expectation of exclusivity, especially after meeting and planning future visits, then he's in the wrong by not being honest. \n\nThe author didn't clarify his intentions when the relationship started. He didn't tell her he was open to other relationships or that he wasn't looking for something serious. The girl might believe they're in a committed, exclusive relationship. If the author is okay with being with her while also dating others, that's non-monogamy, which requires consent from all parties involved. Since he hasn't discussed this with her, proceeding without her knowledge or consent would be dishonest. \n\nAlso, the author is hesitant to break up because he doesn't want to hurt her. But by not being upfront about his intentions from the start, he's setting her up for potential hurt later. The fact that he's considering pursuing others while still keeping her around suggests he might be using her for experience, which could be seen as manipulative or inconsiderate.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the relationship was non-monogamous by mutual agreement. Since the author didn't establish that, and the girl's affection seems genuine, the author is likely in the wrong for not being transparent and for potentially leading her on. The correct answer would be A.\n"
