I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. So the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for maintaining a long-distance relationship and pursuing other girls. The situation is a bit complex. The author is a 22-year-old guy who's been in a long-distance relationship with a girl he met on Tinder. They didn't meet for a while, and there was some back and forth. Then they met in person, had a good time, and she expressed love, but he didn't reciprocate. Now he's conflicted because he's developed feelings but also wants to explore other relationships to gain experience before finding a \"soulmate.\"\n\nFirst, I need to consider the nature of their relationship. They were in a long-distance relationship, which implies some level of commitment, even if it's not formal. The key point here is whether the author is being honest with his partner about his intentions. The author mentions that he's pursuing other girls without being upfront with her. The main issue is that if he's in a relationship, even if it's not exclusive, then pursuing others could be considered a breach of trust unless both parties are aware and okay with it. The author hasn't mentioned discussing this with his partner. \n\nHe also says he doesn't want to cheat, but he's afraid he might if he continues. That suggests he's already engaging in behavior that could be considered cheating. The fact that he hasn't broken up with her yet, but is still pursuing others while keeping her in the loop, is problematic. The girl is clearly emotionally invested, as she bought a train ticket to visit him, and he's afraid to break up with her because he doesn't want to hurt her. However, by not being honest about his intentions and pursuing others, he might be leading her on, which could be more harmful in the long run.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that he wants to gain experience before committing to a long-term relationship. While that's a common mindset, it's important to be transparent with his partner. If he's not in a monogamous relationship, he should communicate that clearly. The fact that he's maintaining the relationship while also seeing others without her knowledge is deceptive. Even if the relationship isn't formal, if she expects exclusivity, then he's in the wrong. \n\nMoreover, the author's actions may be exploiting her feelings. She's put effort into the relationship\u2014buying a ticket, visiting him, expressing love. If he's not committed to a monogamous relationship and isn't honest about it, he's not treating her with the respect she deserves. The key here is the lack of communication. The author needs to have an open and honest conversation with his partner about his intentions and whether they're in agreement on the relationship's terms. Without that, he's acting in a way that's not considerate of her feelings and could lead to emotional harm.\n\nSo, putting this all together, the author is in the wrong because he's not being honest with his partner about his intentions to pursue others, which is a form of emotional manipulation. He should communicate clearly and either commit to the relationship as it is or break up if he can't be honest. By continuing to engage with her while pursuing others, he's violating trust and potentially leading her on."
