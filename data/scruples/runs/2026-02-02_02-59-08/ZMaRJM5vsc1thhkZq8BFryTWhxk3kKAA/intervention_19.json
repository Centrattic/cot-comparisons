I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong.\n\nThe author is in a long-distance relationship and is considering pursuing other girls. He's been with this girl for a year, met in person, had a romantic trip, and she's now very attached. He's enjoying the relationship but feels his feelings are growing too much, fearing commitment. His mindset is that he wants experience to avoid messing up a future \"soulmate\" relationship. \n\nHmm. So, he's not cheating yet, but he's planning to pursue others while staying with her. He's worried about breaking up because it might hurt her, but he doesn't want to commit long-term. The key point is whether he's being dishonest or manipulative. \n\nIn relationships, trust and honesty are crucial. If he's not upfront about his intentions to explore other relationships, then he's being deceitful. Even if he's not cheating now, his plan to pursue others while in a committed relationship (even if not officially labeled as such) is problematic. He's leading her on, making her believe there's potential for a future when he's not sure. Plus, the fact that he's keeping her in his room during her visit adds to the intimacy and could be seen as misleading. \n\nHe's aware of his own limitations and fears commitment, but instead of being honest, he's keeping her around while planning to move on. That seems unfair. The girl is emotionally invested, and he's not giving her the truth. So, yes, he's in the wrong by not being truthful and potentially using her for experience without considering her feelings.\n"
