I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The author is a 22-year-old guy in a long-distance relationship with a girl he met online. They haven't met until recently, and after a three-day visit, he's now considering pursuing other girls while keeping the LDR. \n\nFirst, the main issue here is about honesty and commitment. The question is whether it's wrong to maintain the relationship while pursuing others. The key points are: the author is still in a relationship, even if it's long-distance, and he's thinking about being with other people. \n\nIn relationships, especially when it's exclusive, the norm is monogamy unless otherwise agreed. The author hasn't explicitly mentioned if the relationship is exclusive. If it's not, then maybe both parties are okay with non-monogamy. But if it's supposed to be a monogamous LDR, then the author is being dishonest by planning to pursue others. \n\nThe author is also aware that the girl is into him and that breaking up might hurt her. He's using the idea of gaining experience before settling down as a justification, which is a common but not necessarily valid excuse. The problem is that he's keeping her in the loop while he's not committed to her. That's emotionally manipulative and unfair to her. \n\nEven though he doesn't want to cheat by sleeping with others, the act of pursuing other relationships while being in one is a form of cheating if the relationship is exclusive. The author's mindset of \"I need experience for my future soulmate\" implies that the current relationship is just a stepping stone, which isn't respectful to the girl's feelings. \n\nSo, the answer would be A (author is in the wrong) because he's not being honest about the relationship's boundaries and is leading the girl on even though he's not committing to her.\n"
