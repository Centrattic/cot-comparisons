I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a long-distance relationship where the author is considering pursuing other girls while maintaining the current relationship. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author is in a LDR with a girl he met on Tinder. They haven't met until recently, and after meeting, their relationship became more intimate. The author now feels conflicted because he's developing stronger feelings but isn't ready for a committed relationship. He also mentions his philosophy of gaining experience with different girls to prepare for his \"one true love.\" However, he doesn't want to cheat but is afraid he might if he continues the current relationship. The core question is whether it's wrong to keep the LDR while pursuing others.\n\nThe user wants a yes or no answer based on whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nSo, what's the ethical standpoint here? In most relationships, especially romantic ones, exclusivity is typically expected. If the author is in a relationship and then pursuing others, that's generally considered cheating unless both parties have agreed to an open relationship. The author hasn't mentioned discussing this with his current partner, so it's implied that she's unaware. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that he doesn't want to break her heart by ending it now but also doesn't want to commit long-term. However, by continuing the relationship while looking for others, he's being dishonest and potentially leading her on. Even if he doesn't cheat, the intention to pursue others while in a relationship is deceitful. \n\nThe key issue here is deception and the lack of consent from the partner. The author isn't being upfront about his intentions, which could harm the other person emotionally. The author's actions, though not necessarily physical cheating, are still ethically questionable because they involve leading someone on without full transparency. \n\nTherefore, the author is in the wrong because he's maintaining a relationship with the knowledge that he's not looking to commit and is planning to pursue others, which is dishonest and potentially harmful.\n"
