I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So the user wants to know if the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. The author is in a long-distance relationship with a girl he met on Tinder. They haven't met in person until recently, and after a visit where they had a good time, he's feeling conflicted. He's worried about his growing feelings and the pressure she's putting on him. He also mentions wanting to pursue other girls to gain experience for his future relationship but not wanting to cheat.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications here. The key points are honesty, consent, and mutual understanding in relationships. The author is in a long-distance relationship, which typically requires a lot of trust and communication. He's keeping her in the relationship while also considering pursuing others. But does that count as cheating? If the relationship isn't exclusive, maybe not. However, the problem arises if he's not transparent about his intentions.\n\nThe author mentions that she's affectionate and expressed love, but he hasn't reciprocated. Now he's planning to maintain the relationship while also pursuing others. This could lead to emotional harm if she's not aware of his intentions. The user is asking if he's in the wrong for wanting to do this. \n\nIf the relationship is casual and both parties are aware that he's not looking for a monogamous commitment, then maybe he's not in the wrong. But if she believes they are in a committed relationship and he's not being honest about his intentions to pursue others, that's where the issue lies. The author seems to be aware that this might hurt her, but he's choosing to delay breaking up to avoid immediate hurt.\n\nAnother angle is the initial part where he gave her the cold shoulder because he was afraid she was falling for him. That might have been a breach of trust or emotional manipulation. Plus, he hasn't deleted her even after she had a boyfriend, which might indicate he wasn't entirely upfront about his intentions back then.\n\nIn summary, the author's main issue is not being honest about his intentions to pursue others while maintaining the current relationship. If the relationship is supposed to be exclusive and he hasn't communicated his plans to see others, then he's in the wrong. However, if it's a casual arrangement with mutual understanding, maybe not. But the way he's described it, it seems like he's keeping her in the dark about his intentions, which is unethical. Therefore, the answer is likely A (he is in the wrong).\n"
