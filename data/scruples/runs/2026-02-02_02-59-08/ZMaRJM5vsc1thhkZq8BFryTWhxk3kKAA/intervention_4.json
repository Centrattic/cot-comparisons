I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is a long-distance relationship where the guy is considering pursuing other girls while maintaining the current relationship. \n\nFirst, the user says they met on Tinder a year ago, and the girl became very attached even though they never met. The user felt scared of her attachment and started giving her the cold shoulder. Then later, they reconnect after some time, and she ends up loving him. The user doesn't reciprocate the love but explains why. They plan to meet, spend time together, and he feels his feelings are growing. However, he's worried that if he continues, he might want to pursue others and not want to commit, so he's conflicted about breaking up with her to avoid hurting her.\n\nThe key points are: the user is in a relationship where they didn't reciprocate the girl's feelings initially but now have grown feelings. However, they also have a mindset of wanting to \"get experience\" to prepare for a future relationship, which involves pursuing other girls. The user is conflicted between not wanting to hurt the girl and their own desire to explore other relationships.\n\nNow, considering ethical standards, when someone is in a relationship, they have a responsibility to be honest and not engage in deceptive behavior. If the user is in a committed relationship, pursuing others could be considered cheating or at least emotionally unethical. However, the original question is whether the user is in the wrong for wanting to keep the relationship while also pursuing others. \n\nThe user's reasoning is that they don't want to hurt the girl by breaking up now, but they need to \"gain experience\" for the future. However, the girl seems to be in love with the user and expects exclusivity. If the user is not in a monogamous relationship, maybe it's not cheating, but if they are in a committed relationship (even if not officially), then pursuing others without disclosure is wrong. \n\nThe user hasn't explicitly mentioned whether the relationship is monogamous. However, when the girl says she loves him and they plan to meet, it's implied that there's some level of commitment. The act of pursuing others while in this situation could be seen as deceitful, as it doesn't honor the girl's feelings and expectations. The user is also aware that this might lead to cheating, which is a problem.\n\nIn many relationships, especially when love is expressed, exclusivity is expected. Even if the relationship isn't formally monogamous, the user's intent to pursue others while being in a relationship where the other person is deeply emotionally invested is questionable. The user is prioritizing their own needs over the girl's well-being, which could be seen as unethical or inconsiderate. \n\nTherefore, the author is in the wrong because they are maintaining a relationship where they are not fully committed and are planning to pursue others, which can lead to emotional harm to the girl. The fact that they are aware of this potential harm and still considering it makes it wrong.\n"
