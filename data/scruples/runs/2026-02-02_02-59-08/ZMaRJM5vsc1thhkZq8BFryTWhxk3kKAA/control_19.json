I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that he's in a long-distance relationship with this girl he met on Tinder. They didn't meet for a while, then reconnected, met up, and things were great. Now he's feeling conflicted because he wants to keep the relationship going but also wants to pursue other girls to gain experience before finding his \"one.\"\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. If the relationship is supposed to be monogamous, then pursuing other girls would be a problem. The author mentions he's not cheating yet, but he's considering it because he wants experience. The key question here is whether the relationship was ever monogamous. The user didn't specify if they discussed exclusivity. If they did, then pursuing others would be a breach of trust, making the author wrong. But if it was never exclusive, maybe it's different.\n\nLooking at the story, the girl said she loves him, and he didn't reciprocate. But they were planning to meet and had a physical relationship. If he's in a committed relationship, even without formalizing it, his actions could be deceitful. The author is worried about hurting her by breaking up, but he's also considering pursuing others, which implies he's not being honest about his intentions.\n\nAnother angle is emotional manipulation. The girl is clearly attached and invested, and the author is taking advantage of her feelings while planning to move on. Even if he doesn't cheat right now, keeping her in a situation where she's emotionally invested while he's not fully committed could be harmful. The author's reasoning about gaining experience for a future relationship doesn't justify using someone else in the process.\n\nAlso, the author's fear of commitment might be a red flag. If he can't commit, it's fair for the other person to know. By not being upfront about his intentions to pursue others, he's not being honest, which is a key component of any healthy relationship. So even if both parties are adults, the lack of transparency and the intention to be unfaithful (even if not acted on yet) makes him the asshole.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A.\n"
