I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is a long-distance relationship where the guy is still in contact and wants to pursue other girls.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The guy met a girl online a year ago, she became attached, he pulled away because he was scared. Later, they reconnect, spend time together, and she confesses love. He didn't reciprocate but they planned to meet again. Now, after meeting, he's feeling more attached but also wants to date others. He's worried about cheating and whether he's being the asshole here.\n\nSo, the main question is whether it's wrong to maintain a long-distance relationship while pursuing others. The guy hasn't been clear about his intentions. The girl is into him, and he's keeping her in the loop but not being honest about his desire to date others. That's a problem because in any relationship, even if it's long-distance, you need honesty and mutual understanding. If he's not committed and is planning to pursue others, that's a breach of trust. He's leading her on by not setting boundaries. Also, he's aware that he might hurt her if he breaks up now, but he's choosing not to be truthful instead of being honest and possibly hurting her. That's a bad approach. The guy's actions, even if not physically cheating, are emotionally deceptive. He's using the relationship for experience but not considering her feelings. So, the answer is A (he's in the wrong).\n"
