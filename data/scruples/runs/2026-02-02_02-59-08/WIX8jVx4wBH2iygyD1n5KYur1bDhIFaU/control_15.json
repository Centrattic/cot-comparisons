One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. The scenario involves a guy (21M) who had a sleepover with his female friend (22F) named Annie, without informing his girlfriend (20F). The girlfriend was upset because of previous behaviors where Annie might have crossed boundaries, like playing with his hair and holding his hand at a festival. Also, there was a past conversation where they jokingly discussed threesomes and the guy mentioned Annie, which the girlfriend felt was relevant to the current issue.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author did something wrong. The key points are: the sleepover happened without informing his girlfriend, the girlfriend felt it was inappropriate, and there were prior instances that made the girlfriend uncomfortable. The author didn't mean any harm, but the girlfriend's feelings are valid because in relationships, transparency and consideration of the partner's feelings are important.\n\nEven if the sleepover was accidental, not informing the girlfriend shows a lack of communication. The girlfriend's reaction is based on her feelings of being disrespected or neglected. Additionally, the prior jokes about threesomes and the friend Annie's previous actions might have contributed to the girlfriend's insecurity. The author might not have intended to cause harm, but he should have been aware of how his actions could affect his girlfriend. \n\nSo, while the author didn't act with malice, he is in the wrong for not considering his girlfriend's feelings and for not setting boundaries that would respect their relationship. Therefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
