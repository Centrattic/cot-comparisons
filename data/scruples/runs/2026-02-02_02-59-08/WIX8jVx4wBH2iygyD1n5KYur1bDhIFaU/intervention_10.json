One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break down this situation. The author, a guy in a 2-year relationship, had a female friend over for drinks and ended up sleeping in his bed. His girlfriend found out and was upset, especially because there was a prior conversation where they joked about threesomes, and he mentioned his friend. \n\nFirst, the key points: The friend was in a relationship too, and they both fell asleep together. The author didn't think to tell his girlfriend at the time. The girlfriend was already sensitive because of past incidents, like the friend being touchy, and the joke about threesomes. \n\nThe author's defense is that he didn't mean anything by it and he loves his girlfriend. But the girlfriend felt it was inappropriate, especially after the joke. The author is now conflicted between his girlfriend's feelings and his friendship.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author didn't inform his girlfriend about the sleepover, which could be seen as a lack of transparency. Even if he didn't have intentions, not mentioning it might have been careless. The girlfriend's reaction is partly due to the prior joke about threesomes, which added context that the author didn't account for. \n\nThe author might be in the wrong for not considering how the sleepover could be perceived, especially after their conversation about threesomes. Even if unintentional, it's about respect for the girlfriend's feelings and boundaries. However, the girlfriend's reaction could also be overblown. The author's friend was in a relationship too, so the situation isn't entirely one-sided. \n\nBut the main issue is that the author didn't communicate the sleepover, and the prior joke created a context that made the girlfriend feel insecure. The author should have thought about how his actions might be interpreted, even if he didn't have ill intentions. So, the answer might lean towards A, but there are nuances. However, since the question is about being in the wrong, the lack of communication and the prior context likely make the author at least partially in the wrong.\n"
