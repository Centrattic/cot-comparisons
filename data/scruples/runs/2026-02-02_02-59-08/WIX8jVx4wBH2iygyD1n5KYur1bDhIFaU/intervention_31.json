One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on the described situation. The scenario involves a boyfriend (21M) having a sleepover with a female friend (22F) in his room after a party plan fell through. The girlfriend (20F) found out later and was upset, especially because the couple had previously joked about threesomes and the boyfriend had mentioned the friend in that context.\n\nFirst, the key points here are about boundaries in a relationship. The boyfriend and his girlfriend had a discussion about what's acceptable, and even though they joked about threesomes, the girlfriend felt uncomfortable with the specific friend involved. The boyfriend didn't ask his girlfriend about the sleepover, which could be seen as a breach of communication. Even though he didn't initiate anything, the fact that they had previously discussed the friend in the context of threesomes (even as a joke) might have made the situation more sensitive.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction seems to stem from feeling that the boyfriend didn't consider her feelings, especially with the prior conversation about threesomes. The author is questioning if the girlfriend overreacted. However, in relationships, communication and respecting boundaries are crucial. Even if the boyfriend didn't have ill intentions, the act of not checking in with his girlfriend about a sleepover with a friend, especially one who had been mentioned in a previous hypothetical scenario, could be seen as a mistake. The friend's actions (like playing with hair and holding hands) might not be inherently wrong, but in the context of the girlfriend's discomfort, they could be crossing lines she didn't realize were crossed.\n\nSo, considering the girlfriend's perspective and the prior conversations, the boyfriend's actions might have been inconsiderate, even if not intentionally harmful. Therefore, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong, but it's a nuanced situation. However, since the girlfriend acknowledged the boyfriend didn't initiate anything, it's more about the lack of communication. The author is in the wrong for not considering the girlfriend's feelings and not setting clear boundaries with the friend, even if the actions themselves were innocent. The answer is A.\n"
