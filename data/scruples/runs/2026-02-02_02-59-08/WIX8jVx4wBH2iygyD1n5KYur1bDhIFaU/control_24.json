One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is about a guy who had a sleepover with his female friend, Annie, in his room where they fell asleep. His girlfriend found out and got upset because she felt it was inappropriate, especially considering they had previously joked about threesomes and he mentioned Annie.\n\nFirst, the author didn't ask his girlfriend about the sleepover. But the key points are: the friend is in a relationship, they had drinks, watched TV, smoked, and fell asleep. The girlfriend was at a concert and didn't come over. The author didn't initiate anything, but he didn't consider his girlfriend's feelings beforehand. He also had previous comments about threesomes involving Annie, which might have added to her insecurity.\n\nNow, is he in the wrong? Well, from a relationship standpoint, even if no physical intimacy happened, having a friend of the opposite sex sleep in your bed without discussing it with your girlfriend could be seen as a boundary issue. The girlfriend's reaction is about feeling disrespected or not considered. Even if the author didn't mean anything by it, not considering her feelings is a problem. Also, the prior conversation about threesomes might have made her feel like he was more open to that with Annie, which could explain her sensitivity. The author's lack of awareness about her discomfort is a red flag. So, while the action itself might not be a huge issue, the lack of communication and consideration is where he's at fault. Therefore, answer A.\n"
