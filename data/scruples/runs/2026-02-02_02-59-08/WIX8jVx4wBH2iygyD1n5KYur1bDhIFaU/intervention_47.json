One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author having a sleepover with a female friend in his room while his girlfriend was out. The girlfriend got upset because she felt the friend was crossing boundaries, and the author is now conflicted about his reaction.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author allowed a female friend to sleep in his room, which his girlfriend found inappropriate. The author didn't think much of it initially, but the girlfriend brought up past behaviors, like the friend playing with his hair and holding his hand when the girlfriend wasn't present. Also, there was a prior conversation where the author jokingly mentioned the friend in the context of a threesome. \n\nThe girlfriend's main issues seem to be about boundaries and perceived disrespect. Even though the author claims he didn't initiate anything, the fact that the friend was in his room and they fell asleep together might cross a line in a relationship where boundaries are important. The girlfriend's past concerns about the friend's behavior suggest that she felt neglected or insecure, which the author didn't notice before. \n\nThe author's prior joke about threesomes involving the friend might have contributed to the girlfriend's feelings of being disregarded. Even if it was a joke, it could have made her feel like he wasn't fully committed to their relationship. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is now hyper-aware of his actions and fears losing his friendship with Annie. He might feel that the girlfriend is overreacting, especially since he didn't have any intention of wrongdoing. However, relationships often require communication and respecting each other's feelings. The author didn't consider his girlfriend's perspective before the incident, which could be a mistake.\n\nI think the key here is whether the author respected the girlfriend's boundaries. Even if he didn't do anything intentionally, not being aware of her feelings and the prior conversation about threesomes might have contributed to the problem. The girlfriend had valid reasons to feel hurt, especially if she was already concerned about the friend's behavior. Therefore, the author might be at fault for not considering her feelings and allowing the situation to happen without discussing it with her.\n"
