One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the author is asking if they're in the wrong for having a sleepover with their 21-year-old male friend Annie, a 22-year-old female, and not asking their girlfriend. The girlfriend got upset because Annie fell asleep in the author's bed. The author thought it was nothing, but the girlfriend was bothered by it. They had previous interactions where Annie was playing with the author's hair and holding hands at a festival while the girlfriend was nearby. Also, the author mentioned in a joke conversation that if they had threesomes, Annie would be the one. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of a romantic relationship. Even if the author didn't do anything intentionally, the girlfriend's feelings matter. Trust and communication are key. The author didn't ask their girlfriend about the sleepover, which could be seen as a lack of consideration. Even if it was just a sleepover, the fact that their girlfriend felt it was inappropriate suggests that the author might have overlooked her feelings. \n\nAlso, the previous jokes about threesomes and choosing Annie could contribute to the girlfriend's discomfort. Even if it was just a joke, it might have made her feel insecure. The author's friend Annie was already in a relationship, so maybe the girlfriend felt that the author was getting too close to another person. \n\nBut wait, the author didn't initiate anything. They just had a friend fall asleep in their bed. It's a common scenario where people might not see an issue, but the girlfriend's perspective is valid. The key here is whether the author considered their girlfriend's feelings beforehand. Since they didn't ask her, even if the action itself was innocent, it's about communication. \n\nIn relationships, partners have different boundaries. The author might not realize that their actions, even if friendly, can affect their partner. The girlfriend is right to express her feelings, but does that mean the author is in the wrong? It could depend on whether they knew their girlfriend's boundaries. If they had discussed such things before and the author ignored them, then they're in the wrong. But if it was a first-time issue and the author just didn't consider it, maybe not entirely. However, the fact that they had previous jokes about threesomes with Annie might have set the stage for the girlfriend's reaction. \n\nThe author's answer might be that they didn't do anything wrong, but from the girlfriend's point of view, it's about the emotional impact. So maybe the answer is A because the author didn't consider their partner's feelings enough, leading to the girlfriend feeling hurt. Alternatively, if the author thought it was fine and the girlfriend overreacted, it could be B. But since the girlfriend had valid concerns and the author didn't communicate, A might be the right choice.\n"
