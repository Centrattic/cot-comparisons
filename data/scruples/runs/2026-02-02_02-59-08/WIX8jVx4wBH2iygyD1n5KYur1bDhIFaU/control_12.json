One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation involves a guy who had a sleepover with his 22F friend, Annie, in his dorm room while his 20F girlfriend was out. The girlfriend got upset because he didn't ask her, and there were past incidents where Annie was affectionate towards him. The guy argues that he didn't do anything intentionally wrong and that the girlfriend is overreacting because of a previous conversation about threesomes where he mentioned Annie.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The main issue is whether having a female friend sleep over in his bed without informing his girlfriend is wrong. The girlfriend was in a relationship and they had prior discussions about boundaries. The guy didn't realize his actions were making her uncomfortable until she confronted him. He also mentioned they joked about threesomes, which might have added to her sensitivity.\n\nThe guy's defense is that he didn't initiate the overstepping and that he loves his girlfriend. However, not communicating with his girlfriend about a sleepover could be seen as a breach of trust, even if it was accidental. The girlfriend's perspective is important here; if she felt uncomfortable, even if the guy didn't mean to, it's a valid feeling. The fact that he didn't notice her discomfort before she confronted him might indicate a lack of awareness of her feelings, which could be a point against him.\n\nAlso, the previous mention of threesomes involving Annie might have created a context where the girlfriend felt more threatened. Even if they were joking, it's possible that the girlfriend took it seriously, leading to her reaction. The guy now feels hyper-aware and worried about his friendship with Annie, which shows the situation has affected their dynamics.\n\nNow, considering societal norms and relationship expectations, communication is key. Even if the sleepover was innocent, not checking in with his girlfriend could be seen as a mistake. However, the girlfriend's reaction might be influenced by her own insecurities and past incidents. The guy might not be in the wrong if the actions were unintentional, but he could still have a responsibility to be more perceptive and communicative.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's valid feelings shouldn't be dismissed. If she felt the boundaries were crossed, that's a legitimate concern. The guy's lack of awareness about her feelings could be a flaw, but if he didn't act with malice, it's debatable. The fact that he didn't initiate the overstepping (like Annie's actions) might exonerate him a bit.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the failure to communicate and the lack of awareness of her feelings makes him at fault. Since the AITA format often sides with the person who had the intention to harm or not, but here the girlfriend's feelings are hurt, even if unintentionally. So maybe the guy is not in the wrong (B), but there's a gray area. However, the fact that he didn't notice her discomfort and didn't communicate might lean towards him being partly at fault. But since he didn't act with intent, maybe the answer is B. Alternatively, depending on the community's view on communication in relationships, it could be A. I need to recall similar AITA cases. Typically, if someone's actions (even if innocent) hurt their partner's feelings and they were unaware, it's often a B because they didn't mean harm, but they should have been more aware. However, not informing the partner about a sleepover is a common issue, often seen as a mistake, but not necessarily the person being in the wrong. So the answer is likely B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
