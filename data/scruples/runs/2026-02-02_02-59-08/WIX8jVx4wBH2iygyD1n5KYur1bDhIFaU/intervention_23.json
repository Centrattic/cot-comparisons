One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person in the AITA (Am I the Asshole) situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a guy who had a sleepover with his female friend who's in a relationship, and his girlfriend got upset about it.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The guy and his friend, Annie, ended up sleeping in his bed after a party. His girlfriend found out and was upset. She mentioned past instances where Annie crossed boundaries, like holding his hand and playing with his hair when she was nearby. Also, there was a conversation where they joked about threesomes and he mentioned Annie. Now the guy feels his girlfriend overreacted and is worried about his friendship with Annie.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider relationship boundaries. Even if the sleepover was innocent, having a friend of the opposite sex in the bed could be a trigger for a partner. The girlfriend's main issue might be the lack of communication. The guy didn't ask his girlfriend about the sleepover, which could be seen as a breach of trust. Even if he thought it was nothing, not discussing it with her first is a problem.\n\nAlso, the past behavior mentioned by the girlfriend\u2014Annie's overstepping\u2014suggests there were previous concerns he might have ignored. The joke about threesomes further complicates things because it might have made the girlfriend feel her boundaries were disrespected. The guy didn't consider how his actions, even if unintentional, could affect her feelings. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The fact that he didn't think to ask his girlfriend about the sleepover and didn't take her previous concerns seriously (like Annie's boundary-crossing) shows a lack of consideration. While the sleepover itself might not be inherently wrong, the context and the girlfriend's valid reactions point to the author being in the wrong because he didn't prioritize his partner's feelings and boundaries.\n"
