One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author had a sleepover with their male friend Annie, who is 22 and in a long-term relationship, and the author's girlfriend found out and got upset. The key points here are about boundaries in a relationship and how the author's actions made the girlfriend uncomfortable.\n\nFirst, the author and Annie were watching TV in the author's room, smoked joints, and fell asleep together. The author didn't mention this to the girlfriend until the next morning. The girlfriend was at a concert with a friend and came back to her place instead. The author didn't think it was a big deal initially but the girlfriend was upset. She mentioned that Annie had crossed boundaries before, like playing with the author's hair and holding his hand at a festival when the girlfriend was alone. The author didn't realize these things upset her. Also, there was a previous conversation where they jokingly discussed having threesomes with their friends, and the author had mentioned Annie. The girlfriend feels this made the situation worse because of that comment.\n\nNow, considering relationship norms, even if the author didn't do anything intentionally harmful, the girlfriend's feelings are valid. Being in a relationship means being considerate of the partner's boundaries. Sharing a bed with another person, even if it's just sleep, can be seen as crossing a line, especially when the girlfriend is already sensitive about boundaries. The fact that the author hadn't noticed previous behaviors that upset his girlfriend suggests he wasn't paying attention to her feelings. Also, the mention of a past joke about threesomes involving Annie might have made the girlfriend feel that the author's actions were more problematic than they actually were, or that he wasn't taking her concerns seriously.\n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't initiate the sleepover and it was an accident. He didn't have intentions to hurt his girlfriend, but his lack of awareness and communication might have contributed to the problem. However, the girlfriend's reaction could be seen as overblown if the actual incident wasn't malicious. But in relationships, it's about how each person feels, not just the action. The author's failure to recognize the girlfriend's discomfort in previous instances and now not being considerate enough in the sleepover situation might mean he's at least partially responsible.\n\nSo, the author didn't do anything illegal or clearly wrong, but in the context of a relationship, not being mindful of the partner's boundaries can be seen as wrong. The girlfriend's perspective is valid, and the author's negligence in recognizing her feelings leads to a problem. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because he didn't consider his girlfriend's feelings and boundaries, even if unintentionally.\n"
