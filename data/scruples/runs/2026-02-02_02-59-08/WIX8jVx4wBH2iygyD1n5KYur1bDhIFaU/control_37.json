One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author had a sleepover with their female friend Annie, who is in a relationship. The girlfriend found out and was upset, especially because the author had previously joked about having threesomes and mentioned Annie. The author argues that they didn't do anything wrong because they didn't initiate the situation and that the girlfriend blew it out of proportion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the boundaries in the author's relationship. The girlfriend is upset because her partner had a friend, who's in a relationship, sleep over in his bed. Even if they just fell asleep, it's possible that the girlfriend felt her trust was compromised. The key here might be communication. The author didn't ask permission or inform the girlfriend beforehand, which can be a point of contention in a relationship. Even though they were just hanging out, sharing a bed with another person can be a sensitive issue, especially if one partner is more possessive or has trust issues.\n\nThen there's the part about the previous conversation about threesomes. Even if it's just hypothetical and not serious, bringing up the friend's name in that context might have created a seed of doubt. The girlfriend might feel that the author's offhand comment made the situation with Annie more significant than it was. The author might not have realized how much that comment affected their girlfriend's perception.\n\nAnother angle is the author's awareness. They admit they didn't notice that the girlfriend was bothered by Annie's actions before. That suggests they might not be as attuned to their girlfriend's feelings as they should be. In a healthy relationship, both partners should be aware of each other's boundaries and comfort levels. The author's lack of awareness here could be a problem.\n\nAlso, the fact that the author is now hyper-aware of their actions around Annie shows that they are concerned about their girlfriend's feelings, but they also fear losing their friendship. This indicates a conflict between their social life and their relationship, which is common but needs to be navigated carefully.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, the argument is that they didn't do anything intentionally wrong. But in relationships, intentions aren't the only factor\u2014perceptions and communication matter. Even if the author didn't mean to cross a line, not considering the girlfriend's perspective and not communicating openly about boundaries might be where they went wrong. The girlfriend has the right to feel uncomfortable, especially if there were prior jokes about threesomes involving her partner and Annie. The author's failure to recognize the girlfriend's concerns and address them proactively could contribute to the problem.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might be overreacting if the situation was innocent. However, the key here is that the girlfriend felt it was a big deal, and the author didn't address her feelings until after the fact. In relationships, it's important to validate each other's feelings, even if they seem out of proportion. The author might not have been in the wrong in terms of actions, but in terms of communication and consideration of the girlfriend's feelings, there's room for them to have handled it better. So maybe the answer is A, the author is in the wrong, because they didn't communicate and consider their girlfriend's perspective, even if the action itself wasn't malicious.\n"
