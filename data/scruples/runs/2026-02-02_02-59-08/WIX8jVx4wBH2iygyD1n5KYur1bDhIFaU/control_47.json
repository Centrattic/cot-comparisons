One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author had a sleepover with their male friend Annie, who is in a long-term relationship. They had drinks, watched TV, smoked some joints, and fell asleep in the author's room. The girlfriend found out later and was upset about it. She also brought up past instances where Annie had touched the author in ways that bothered her, like playing with his hair or holding his hand at a festival when she was walking behind. The author didn't think much of those actions before, but now he's worried about his friendship with Annie.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the girlfriend's perspective. She's in a two-year relationship, so trust and boundaries are important. Even if the author didn't do anything wrong on purpose, the fact that Annie was sleeping in his bed could be seen as a breach of trust. Plus, the girlfriend mentioned a past conversation where they discussed having threesomes and the author mentioned Annie. That might have planted some seeds of doubt or insecurity in her mind. Even if they were just joking around, mentioning it could make her feel like he's been fantasizing about someone else, which might not be fair to her.\n\nThen there's the part where the author didn't ask his girlfriend about the sleepover. If they have open communication, maybe he should have checked in with her before having Annie over. The fact that he didn't notice the boundaries Annie crossed before might indicate he wasn't paying attention to her feelings, even if unintentionally. However, the author didn't initiate the sleepover; it just happened after plans fell through. So maybe he didn't have malicious intent.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend is reacting strongly to things that the author didn't realize were problematic. The question is whether her reaction is disproportionate. The author feels she's blowing it out of proportion, but in relationships, boundaries are crucial. Even if the actions themselves aren't overtly wrong, the perception and the girlfriend's feelings matter. The author might have been negligent in being aware of how his actions affected his girlfriend, especially since there's a history of them discussing such scenarios.\n\nAlso, the author now feels hyper-aware of how he acts around Annie, which could strain their friendship. But if the girlfriend's feelings are valid, the author should probably adjust his behavior to respect her boundaries. So, maybe the author isn't entirely in the wrong because he didn't act with intent to hurt, but he might have been careless in not considering the impact of his actions on his girlfriend. The key points are the lack of communication before the sleepover, not noticing Annie's previous boundary-crossing, and the girlfriend's justified insecurity based on past conversations. So, balancing these factors, the author might share some responsibility, but maybe the girlfriend's reaction is also valid. However, since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, the answer might be A (Yes) because he didn't consider his girlfriend's feelings and boundaries adequately, even if unintentionally.\n"
