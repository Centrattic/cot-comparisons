One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation involves the author having a sleepover with a female friend who ended up in his bed, not informing his girlfriend, and the girlfriend being upset about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The friends were supposed to go to a party but decided not to, so they stayed in the author's room, watched TV, smoked, and fell asleep. The girlfriend was at a concert with a friend. The next day, the author tells the girlfriend, but she's upset. She mentions past instances where the friend crossed boundaries, like playing with his hair and holding hands. The author had mentioned the friend as a potential person for a threesome in jokes, which might have contributed to the girlfriend's feelings.\n\nThe author feels the girlfriend overreacted. But from the girlfriend's perspective, even if the author didn't do anything intentionally, the situation could be seen as crossing a boundary. Sharing a bed with another person, especially a friend of the opposite sex, might be a red flag in a relationship. Plus, the girlfriend points out prior boundary issues and the comment about threesomes, which adds context to her concerns.\n\nEven if the author didn't mean anything by it, not considering how the girlfriend might feel is a problem. Communication is key in relationships. The author didn't check in with his girlfriend about the plans, which led to her feeling blindsided. The fact that he didn't realize these actions bothered her before suggests he wasn't attuned to her feelings, which is a common issue in relationships.\n\nSo, even if the author didn't have malicious intent, the lack of communication and awareness of the girlfriend's feelings makes him responsible. The answer would likely be A, that he's in the wrong.\n"
