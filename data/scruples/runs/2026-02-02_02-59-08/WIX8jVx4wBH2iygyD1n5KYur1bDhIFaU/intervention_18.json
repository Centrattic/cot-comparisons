One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. The question is between A (Yes) or B (No). \n\nFirst, I need to parse the scenario carefully. The author (21M) had a sleepover with his friend Annie (22F) in his room after a night of drinking and smoking. The girlfriend (20F) found out and was upset. The key points here are about boundaries and communication in a relationship.\n\nThe author didn't inform his girlfriend about the sleepover. Even though the intention was just hanging out with a friend, the fact that they ended up in the same bed without informing his girlfriend could be a problem. The girlfriend felt it was inappropriate, especially since she had mentioned previous instances where Annie crossed boundaries, like playing with his hair and holding his hand while she was nearby. The author might not have realized how these actions affected his girlfriend, but the lack of communication is a red flag.\n\nAlso, there's the part where the author and girlfriend had joked about threesomes and he mentioned Annie. This could have triggered the girlfriend's insecurities. Even if it was just a joke, it shows that the author's friend is someone they both consider in a sexual context, which might not be comforting for the girlfriend.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, relationships require communication and respecting each other's boundaries. Even if the author didn't have ill intentions, not telling his girlfriend about the sleepover and being unaware of her discomfort with Annie's behavior could be seen as neglecting her feelings. The author might not have done anything malicious, but the lack of awareness and communication is where the issue lies.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might be overreacting, but that doesn't mean the author is right. In a healthy relationship, both partners should address their concerns. The author's failure to acknowledge his girlfriend's perspective and the previous boundary issues Annie had might make him at fault, even if unintentionally. \n\nSo, considering all that, I think the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because he didn't communicate the sleepover and wasn't attentive to his girlfriend's concerns about Annie's behavior, which led to her feeling disrespected or insecure.\n"
