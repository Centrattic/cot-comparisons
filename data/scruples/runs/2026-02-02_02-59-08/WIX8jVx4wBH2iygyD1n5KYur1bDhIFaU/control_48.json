One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is about a guy who had a sleepover with his female friend, and his girlfriend got upset about it. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The guy and his friend ended up sleeping in his bed after a party. The girlfriend found out later and was upset. The girlfriend mentioned past instances where the friend touched him in ways she didn't like, like holding hands and playing with hair. Also, there was a previous conversation where the guy said he'd sleep with his friend if they had threesomes, which he thought was just a joke. \n\nNow, the girlfriend's main issues seem to be about boundaries and past comments. The author might not have realized how his actions affected her. But did he do something wrong? If the sleepover was just falling asleep together without any intention, maybe not. However, the fact that he mentioned the friend in a hypothetical threesome scenario could be a red flag. Even if it was just a joke, it might have made the girlfriend feel insecure. \n\nAlso, the friend was in a long-term relationship herself, so maybe the guy didn't think it was a big deal. But the girlfriend felt hurt because she noticed the boundaries being crossed. The author's problem is that he didn't consider how his actions made her feel, even if he didn't mean anything by them. So, is he in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. \n\nOn one hand, he didn't do anything intentionally. On the other, he might have been neglectful in acknowledging her feelings and past concerns. The girlfriend has a right to feel upset if she felt those boundaries were being crossed. So maybe the answer is A, but I need to check if the main issue is the sleepover or the past comments. The past comments about the threesome might be the bigger issue here because it shows a lack of consideration for her feelings. So the author might be in the wrong for that, even if the sleepover itself wasn't intentional.\n"
