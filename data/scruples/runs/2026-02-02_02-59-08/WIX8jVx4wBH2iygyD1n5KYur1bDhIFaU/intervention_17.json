One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation involves a guy having a sleepover with his female friend when his girlfriend wasn't present. They ended up in his bed without explicitly asking his girlfriend, which led to some tension.\n\nFirst, communication is key in relationships. The author didn't inform his girlfriend about the sleepover, which could be a red flag. Even if the friend fell asleep accidentally, not checking in with his girlfriend shows a lack of consideration for her feelings. The girlfriend felt it was inappropriate, and even though the author didn't intend anything, the lack of communication is on him.\n\nAlso, the girlfriend mentioned past instances where the friend crossed boundaries. The author might not have realized the extent of her discomfort until she brought it up, but he should have been more attentive to her feelings. The fact that they had joked about threesomes involving Annie might have added to the girlfriend's anxiety, making her feel her boundaries were being ignored.\n\nHowever, the author didn't initiate any wrongdoing; he just didn't foresee the issue. The core issue here is the lack of communication and not being aware of the girlfriend's perspective. So, the author might be partially at fault for not considering her feelings and not setting clear boundaries with his friend. Therefore, the answer leans towards A.\n"
