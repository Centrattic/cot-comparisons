One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break down this situation. The user, a 21-year-old male, had a sleepover with his female friend Annie (22F) without informing his girlfriend (20F). They both fell asleep in his bed after hanging out. His girlfriend found out later and was upset, especially because they had previously joked about threesomes and mentioned Annie. Now, the user feels his girlfriend overreacted and is worried about his friendship with Annie.\n\nFirst, even though the user didn't have any intentions, the act of having a friend of the opposite sex sleep over in his bed without informing his girlfriend can be seen as violating trust. Relationships often have unspoken boundaries, and not communicating such a situation can lead to feelings of betrayal. The girlfriend might feel that the sleepover, even if innocent, was a transgression of those boundaries.\n\nNext, the girlfriend mentioned past instances where Annie crossed lines, like playing with his hair and holding hands. The user didn't realize these actions upset her, which shows a lack of awareness of the girlfriend's feelings. The fact that they had joked about threesomes and mentioned Annie adds another layer. Even if it was just a joke, bringing up a specific friend in that context could make the girlfriend feel insecure or disrespected.\n\nThe user's current feelings that he's being blamed for something minor might be valid if the girlfriend's reaction was excessive. However, the core issue is about communication and respect for the girlfriend's feelings. The user didn't ask for permission or even inform his girlfriend about the sleepover, which is a significant oversight. In relationships, transparency is key to maintaining trust. \n\nSo, while the user might not have acted with ill intent, the lack of communication and the girlfriend's justified concerns about Annie's behavior point towards the user being at least partially in the wrong. The main fault lies in not considering the girlfriend's perspective and the boundaries she might have, which led to the conflict.\n"
