One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation involves a guy who had a sleepover with his female friend, and his girlfriend was upset about it. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The guy's friend, Annie, came over to his room to watch TV and smoke. They ended up falling asleep together in his bed. The girlfriend found out later and was upset, especially because there was prior talk about potential threesomes involving Annie. The guy claims he didn't do anything wrong since he didn't initiate the interaction, but he also didn't realize his actions upset his girlfriend.\n\nNow, considering the girlfriend's perspective. In relationships, communication and boundaries are crucial. Even if the guy didn't have intentions, the act of having a friend sleep in his bed might cross the line from the girlfriend's point of view. The fact that they had discussed threesomes jokingly and he mentioned Annie makes it more sensitive. The girlfriend might feel insecure or that her trust is being compromised, even if there's no actual infidelity.\n\nOn the guy's side, he might not see it as a big deal because there was no physical intimacy, and he didn't mean to hurt her. However, the issue is about perception and how his actions affect his partner's feelings. The girlfriend is valid in expressing her discomfort, especially since the conversation about threesomes could have triggered her insecurity. The guy's not being aware of her feelings shows a lack of communication, which is a problem in a relationship.\n\nSo, the question is whether the guy is at fault. He didn't act with malice, but he didn't consider how his actions might affect his girlfriend. In relationships, partners need to be mindful of each other's feelings and boundaries. Even if the situation was innocent, the girlfriend's reaction is valid because her trust and comfort matter. The guy might not be \"wrong\" in a malicious sense, but he is responsible for not addressing her concerns and not being more considerate of her perspective. Therefore, he shares some responsibility here.\n"
