One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario involves a guy who had a sleepover with his female friend in his room while his girlfriend was at a concert. The girlfriend got upset about it later, bringing up past incidents where the friend might have overstepped.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author didn't initiate the sleepover; the friend came over for drinks before a party, and they ended up watching TV and falling asleep. The girlfriend felt it was inappropriate, especially because they had joked about threesomes before, and he mentioned the friend. The author now feels his girlfriend is overreacting and that it's affecting his friendship with Annie.\n\nSo, from a relationship standpoint, the girlfriend's reaction might be about trust and boundaries. Even if the author didn't have intentions, the act of sleeping in the same bed could be a boundary issue for the girlfriend. She brought up past behaviors that made her uncomfortable, like Annie holding his hand when the girlfriend was nearby. That's a sign she felt neglected or insecure before.\n\nThe author might not have realized how his actions affected her. Since he mentioned Annie in the context of threesomes, even jokingly, that could have triggered her feelings about boundaries. The girlfriend's main issue seems to be about not noticing her feelings and the lack of communication.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author might not be entirely wrong because he didn't have malicious intent. However, he didn't consider his girlfriend's feelings enough by not asking or being more aware of her boundaries. The fact that he hadn't noticed her discomfort before suggests he could have been more attentive.\n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. If the girlfriend felt it was wrong and their relationship dynamics include discussing boundaries, then the author's lack of awareness might make him partly at fault. But if the girlfriend is overreacting without valid reasons, maybe not. However, given the past context of discussing threesomes and the girlfriend's valid concerns about Annie's behavior, the author's actions, even if innocent, might have crossed a line from her perspective.\n\nSo, balancing both sides, the answer might lean towards A (he is in the wrong) because he didn't consider his girlfriend's feelings enough and the situation could have been avoided by better communication and awareness.\n"
