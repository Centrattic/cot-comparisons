One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for having a sleepover with a friend and not informing his girlfriend. The situation involves the author's girlfriend being upset about his friend Annie sleeping in his bed, even though he didn't intend anything. \n\nFirst, the key points: The author and his friend Annie ended up sleeping in his bed after drinking and smoking. The girlfriend found out later and was upset. The author didn't think it was a big deal, but the girlfriend felt it was inappropriate. The girlfriend also mentioned past instances where Annie might have overstepped, and there was a conversation about threesomes where the author mentioned Annie.\n\nNow, considering relationships, communication is key. The author didn't inform his girlfriend about the sleepover. While he didn't have intentions of being inappropriate, not discussing it with his girlfriend could be seen as a breach of trust. The girlfriend's reaction seems to stem from feeling insecure or not being considered in the author's decisions. The fact that they had talked about threesomes and the author mentioned Annie might have planted seeds of doubt in the girlfriend's mind, making her more sensitive to Annie's interactions.\n\nThe author didn't realize how his actions affected his girlfriend. Even if he didn't mean anything by Annie being in his bed, the lack of communication is a problem. The girlfriend's valid concerns about boundaries and the past comments about threesomes might have been the root of her anger. The author should have been more aware of her feelings and discussed the situation with her proactively to avoid misunderstandings.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might be overreacting if she's holding past jokes about threesomes against him. The author didn't act on those jokes, but the mention of Annie in that context could have caused unnecessary anxiety. The author's hyper-awareness of his behavior towards Annie now shows that he's trying to adjust, but the initial mistake was not communicating openly with his girlfriend.\n\nSo, the author is in the wrong because he didn't communicate with his girlfriend about the sleepover, which is a significant part of maintaining trust in a relationship. Even if his intentions were innocent, not discussing it with his partner led to hurt feelings and a breakdown in communication. The answer would be A, he is in the wrong.\n"
