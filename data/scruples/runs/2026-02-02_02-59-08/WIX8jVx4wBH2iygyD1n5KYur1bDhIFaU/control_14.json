One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario involves a guy who had a sleepover with his female friend, Annie, in his room after they both decided not to go to a party. His girlfriend found out and was upset, especially because there was a previous conversation where the author mentioned Annie in the context of hypothetical threesomes.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author didn't initiate the sleepover, and it was accidental\u2014they fell asleep together after drinking and smoking. The girlfriend was at a concert with a friend, so she wasn't expecting him to be alone. The author didn't ask his girlfriend beforehand, which might be a point of contention. \n\nThe girlfriend's main issue seems to be not just the sleepover but also previous instances where Annie crossed boundaries, like playing with his hair and holding his hand. The fact that the author had mentioned Annie in a hypothetical threesome conversation probably exacerbated her feelings of jealousy or insecurity. \n\nThe author claims he didn't mean anything by Annie's actions and loves his girlfriend. However, the girlfriend felt hurt and that he didn't notice her concerns before. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not considering her feelings or if the girlfriend overreacted.\n\nIn relationships, communication and boundaries are key. Even if the sleepover was accidental, the author should have considered his girlfriend's perspective. The fact that he had mentioned Annie in a hypothetical sexual context might have made the girlfriend feel that his casual attitude towards Annie could be a problem. \n\nOn the other hand, if the author didn't have any intentions and it was a genuine accident, maybe the girlfriend overreacted. But relationships often require being mindful of each other's feelings, especially when it comes to close friends. The author might not have done anything intentionally wrong, but he could have been more considerate of his girlfriend's feelings by maybe not having Annie in his room in the first place, especially since there were past issues.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the author's actions, while not intentional, were careless regarding his girlfriend's feelings. The mention of the threesome conversation adds another layer, making the girlfriend's reaction more understandable. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not being more attentive to his girlfriend's boundaries and for being in a situation that could be misinterpreted, even if it was accidental.\n"
