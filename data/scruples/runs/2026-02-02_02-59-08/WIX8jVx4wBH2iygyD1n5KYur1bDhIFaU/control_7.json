One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong. The situation involves a guy who had a sleepover with his female friend in his room while his girlfriend was out. The next day, his girlfriend confronted him about it, feeling it was inappropriate. The key points here are the context of the sleepover and the girlfriend's past conversations with the author about threesomes.\n\nFirst, the sleepover happened because they were not going to the party. They watched TV, smoked, and fell asleep. The author didn't initiate the sleepover, but it's in his room. The girlfriend was out with friends. The author didn't inform the girlfriend beforehand, which could be a point of contention.\n\nThe girlfriend brought up past instances where the friend crossed boundaries, like playing with his hair and holding hands at a festival. The author didn't realize these actions bothered her until she mentioned them. Also, there's the mention of a previous joke about threesomes where the author suggested the friend. This could have planted seeds of insecurity in the girlfriend.\n\nNow, considering relationship norms, trust and communication are crucial. The author didn't think to ask his girlfriend about the sleepover, which might have been a breach of trust. Even if the sleepover was innocent, not discussing it beforehand could make the girlfriend feel excluded or insecure. The girlfriend's reaction might be influenced by her past conversations with the author about threesomes involving the friend, making her more sensitive to the situation.\n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't do anything intentionally wrong. The sleepover was with a friend, and he didn't initiate it. The girlfriend's reaction seems to be more about her own insecurities and past comments rather than the actual event. However, in relationships, partners often expect their significant others to consider their feelings and communicate about their interactions with friends, especially when it involves sleeping together.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. He didn't mean any harm, but he didn't consider his girlfriend's feelings beforehand. The girlfriend's reaction is partly justified because of the past context, but maybe she overreacted. The author's not in the wrong for the sleepover itself, but he could have handled the communication better. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong in general. Since he didn't do anything intentionally harmful, but also didn't consider his girlfriend's perspective, it's a B (not in the wrong) but with a caveat about communication.\n"
