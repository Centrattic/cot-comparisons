One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author, a guy, had a sleepover with his female friend Annie, who's in a long-term relationship. They were hanging out, drinking, smoking, and ended up falling asleep in his bed. His girlfriend found out and was upset because of past incidents where Annie had crossed boundaries, plus the fact that they had joked about threesomes and the author mentioned Annie's name.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author didn't ask his girlfriend beforehand, which might be a red flag. Communication is key in relationships, so not informing her about a sleepover with a friend, especially one in a relationship themselves, could be an issue. Also, the fact that they were in his room and ended up in bed might be problematic, even if they didn't intend anything sexual. The girlfriend's reaction is based on feeling that these interactions are inappropriate, even if the author didn't mean them to be.\n\nThen there's the part where they had discussed threesomes playfully, and the author mentioned Annie. Even though it wasn't taken seriously, that comment might have triggered the girlfriend's insecurities. She might feel that the author's casual mention of Annie in that context, combined with the sleepover, is a setup for something more. The author might be in the wrong for not being aware of how his actions and words affect her feelings. He didn't notice her being bothered before, which suggests he might not have been paying attention to her boundaries or emotional state.\n\nOn the other hand, Annie didn't initiate the sleepover; the author was just too tired to move her out. Also, he didn't do anything wrong intentionally, but the girlfriend's feelings are valid. Jealousy and insecurity can stem from past behaviors even if they weren't meant to be harmful. So the author's lack of awareness and not communicating could have contributed to her feeling hurt or neglected.\n\nBut the question is whether he's in the wrong. The key points are: not informing the girlfriend, the sleepover in his bed, and the past comments about threesomes. The girlfriend's perspective is important here. Even if the author didn't mean for anything to happen, the actions still caused her distress. The fact that he was hyper-aware after the conversation and worried about his friendship with Annie might show he's trying to be considerate now, but that doesn't negate the initial oversight.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would likely be A (Yes), the author is in the wrong for not being mindful of his girlfriend's feelings and not communicating properly. But maybe there's a nuance where the girlfriend overreacted based on past issues. Wait, the author didn't do anything wrong per se, but the girlfriend felt it was inappropriate. In relationships, intentions matter but the impact on the partner is also important. Even if it was unintentional, not checking in and being unaware of her boundaries could be seen as a mistake. However, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. The girlfriend's reaction is valid, but the author's actions\u2014sleeping in the same bed as a friend when he's in a relationship\u2014might be seen as crossing a boundary. So yeah, probably A.\n"
