One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the story) is in the wrong. The situation involves a girlfriend (GF) and a close female friend (Annie) who slept over with the author. The author didn't inform the GF, and the GF is upset.\n\nFirst, the key points from the story: The author and Annie had a sleepover after a party, fell asleep in his room. GF was at a concert with a friend. The author told her the next day, but didn't think much of it. The GF later confronts him about it, pointing out other instances where Annie crossed boundaries (hair, hand-holding). The author mentioned Annie as a potential person for a threesome in a joking conversation, which the GF brought up as a reason for her hurt.\n\nNow, the author is wondering if the GF overreacted and if he's in the wrong for feeling that way, affecting his friendship with Annie.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but is curious. So, the task is to decide A (Yes, author is wrong) or B (No).\n\nLooking at the elements: The author didn't inform the GF about the sleepover. Even though it might have been accidental, not informing a partner about someone else sleeping in the same bed can be a red flag. The GF was upset about previous incidents where Annie was affectionate in ways that made her uncomfortable. The author might not have realized how these actions (even if unintentional) could make the GF feel insecure or undervalued. Additionally, the mention of Annie in the context of a threesome, even in a joking manner, could contribute to the GF's feelings of being disregarded. \n\nThe author's response was to not think much of it for days, which shows a lack of immediate communication or consideration. The GF's reaction is about feeling that the boundaries weren't respected. The author might be in the wrong for not being more mindful of the GF's feelings and for not addressing the issue sooner, even if the actions themselves were innocent.\n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't initiate the sleepover, and Annie's actions might have been out of her control. The author didn't have malicious intent. The GF's reaction might be influenced by the past conversation about threesomes, which could have made her more sensitive. However, in relationships, communication and considering the partner's feelings are key. The author's failure to recognize the GF's discomfort and the potential for misunderstanding could make him share some blame.\n\nConsidering all factors, the author's lack of awareness and communication might make him in the wrong, so the answer would be A.\n"
