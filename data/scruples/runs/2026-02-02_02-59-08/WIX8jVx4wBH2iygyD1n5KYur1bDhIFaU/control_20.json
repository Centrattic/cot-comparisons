One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author, a guy, had a friend (Annie) over to his room. They had drinks, smoked weed, watched TV, and ended up falling asleep together in his bed. The girlfriend found out and was upset, especially because there was prior talk about threesomes and the friend crossing boundaries. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author didn't plan for Annie to stay overnight. They were at a party and then decided not to go, so they stayed in his room. But the key issue here is having a sleepover with a friend of the opposite sex when the girlfriend is not around. Even though they just fell asleep, the girlfriend felt it was inappropriate. \n\nThe girlfriend mentioned past incidents where Annie had crossed boundaries, like holding his hand or playing with his hair in front of her. The author didn't realize these made her uncomfortable. Also, there was a conversation where the author mentioned Annie in the context of potential threesomes, which seems to have triggered her reaction.\n\nNow, whether the author is in the wrong depends on the boundaries they've established as a couple. If they never discussed what's acceptable behavior with friends of the opposite sex, the author might not be entirely at fault. However, the girlfriend's feelings are valid. Even if the author didn't intend anything, the act of having another girl in his bed could be seen as a breach of trust or emotional boundaries, especially given the prior talk about threesomes.\n\nThe author might argue that it was innocent, but the girlfriend's perspective is important. Relationships require communication and awareness of each other's feelings. The author didn't consider how the sleepover might affect his girlfriend and wasn't aware of the previous boundaries she was concerned about. So, while he didn't do it intentionally to hurt her, his lack of awareness and communication could be seen as a mistake.\n\nOn the other hand, if the girlfriend didn't clearly express her boundaries before, the author might not have known. But since she later explained her feelings and the prior mention of threesomes, it's possible he should have been more cautious, especially if they've discussed such topics lightly before. The fact that he now fears his friendship with Annie will change suggests he realizes the sensitivity of the situation.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the author might not be entirely in the wrong, but he could be at fault for not being more attentive to his girlfriend's feelings and boundaries, especially given the prior context. However, the situation is nuanced, and the girlfriend's reaction is also valid given her feelings.\n"
