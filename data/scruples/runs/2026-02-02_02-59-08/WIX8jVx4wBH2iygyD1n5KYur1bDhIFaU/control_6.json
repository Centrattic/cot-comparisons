One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author, a guy in a two-year relationship, had his female friend, Annie, over for a sleepover. They ended up in his bed after a night of drinking and smoking, while his girlfriend was out at a concert with a friend. The girlfriend found out later and was upset, bringing up past incidents where Annie might have been too familiar. The author didn't think much of it at the time but now feels the girlfriend is overreacting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of a relationship. Trust and communication are key. The author didn't ask his girlfriend about the sleepover, which could be seen as a breach of trust, even if it was just a friend sleeping in the same room. The girlfriend mentioned that they had talked about threesomes and the author mentioned Annie in that conversation, which might have planted a seed of insecurity in her.\n\nEven if the author didn't have any intentions, the fact that a friend of the opposite sex slept in his bed without the girlfriend's knowledge could be a red flag. Relationships often have boundaries, and not discussing such a situation with the partner can lead to hurt feelings. The girlfriend's perspective is valid because she felt her boundaries were crossed, even if the author didn't. Also, the past incidents where Annie was overly familiar (like playing with hair and holding hands) might have contributed to her current anxiety.\n\nThe author's defense is that he didn't mean anything by it and loves his girlfriend, but in relationships, actions matter more than intentions. The girlfriend's reaction is about feeling disrespected and insecure. The author not noticing these behaviors before might indicate a lack of awareness of her feelings, which is important in a relationship. \n\nOn the other hand, if the author had no intention of being with Annie and the situation was accidental, maybe the girlfriend is overreacting. But the key points here are the lack of communication and the girlfriend's justified insecurity based on previous behavior and discussions. The author's failure to consider how his actions affected her trust and the boundaries of the relationship suggests he might be in the wrong. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is likely A, the author is in the wrong because he didn't communicate properly and failed to respect his girlfriend's feelings and boundaries.\n"
