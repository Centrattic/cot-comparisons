One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. Let me break it down.\n\nSo, the author had a sleepover with his friend Annie, who is in a long-term relationship. The girlfriend found out and was upset. She mentioned other instances where Annie might have overstepped, like playing with his hair and holding his hand at a festival. The author didn't think anything of it, but the girlfriend was hurt. Also, there was a prior conversation where they joked about threesomes, and the author mentioned Annie. The girlfriend is upset that he didn't consider her feelings, even though he didn't mean to.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks he is, but wants my opinion. Let's consider the key points. The author didn't ask his girlfriend, but did he have a responsibility to? Since they were in a two-year relationship, communication is important. Even if the sleepover was innocent, the girlfriend felt it was inappropriate, especially in the context of past jokes about threesomes. The fact that the author didn't notice her discomfort until she brought it up shows a lack of awareness of her feelings. \n\nAlso, having a friend of the opposite sex sleep over in his bed, even if it was accidental, could be a red flag for the girlfriend. The author's casual attitude towards Annie's actions (like holding hands) might have contributed to her feeling that he's not respecting their boundaries. The girlfriend's reaction seems valid because trust and communication are crucial in a relationship. The author might be in the wrong for not being more considerate of her perspective and for not being proactive in avoiding situations that could cause her distress, even if unintentionally.\n\nBut wait, the author didn't initiate the sleepover. They were both too tired after getting high. He didn't mean to overstep, and he loves his girlfriend. However, the prior conversation about threesomes complicates things. Even if it was a joke, bringing up Annie in that context could have made the girlfriend more sensitive. The author should have been more mindful of how his actions might affect her, especially if they had discussed such topics before. \n\nSo, the main issue is the lack of communication and not considering her feelings. The author might not have done anything intentionally wrong, but he didn't take her feelings into account, which is part of being in a relationship. Answering A (in the wrong) makes sense because he should have been more aware and communicated better. But if the situation was truly innocent, maybe B (not in the wrong) is possible. However, given the girlfriend's perspective and the prior context, A is more likely.\n"
