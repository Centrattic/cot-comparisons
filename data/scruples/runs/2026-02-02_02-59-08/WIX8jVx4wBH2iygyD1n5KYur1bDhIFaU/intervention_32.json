One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario involves the author (21M) having a sleepover with a female friend (22F) and not informing his girlfriend (20F). The girlfriend is upset about this, even though the author didn't do anything intentionally wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the girlfriend's perspective. She's in a two-year relationship, so trust and boundaries are important. The fact that the girlfriend felt the need to talk to the author about this issue suggests that she felt her trust was compromised. Even if the author didn't do anything wrong, not informing his girlfriend about the sleepover could be seen as a lack of communication or consideration for her feelings. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend mentioned past instances where the friend crossed boundaries, like holding his hand and playing with his hair. The author might not have realized how these actions affected his girlfriend, but the fact that they had discussed threesomes and the author mentioned the friend could have planted seeds of insecurity in the girlfriend. \n\nFrom the author's side, he didn't intend to hurt his girlfriend. He thought the sleepover was innocent and didn't realize it was a problem until she pointed it out. However, in a relationship, it's important to communicate openly about boundaries. Even if the author felt the situation was minor, not checking in with his girlfriend could be a mistake. The key here is the girlfriend's feelings and how the author's actions, even if unintentional, affected her trust.\n\nIn relationships, what matters is how each person feels, not just the objective facts. The author might not be at fault in terms of actions, but in terms of communication and considering his girlfriend's feelings, there could be room for improvement. The answer might be that the author is not in the wrong (since he didn't do anything intentionally), but there's a misunderstanding about boundaries and communication. So, the answer would be B (No), because the author isn't in the wrong, but he could have been more considerate in communication.\n"
