One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for having a friend sleep over in his bed and not informing his girlfriend. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author's friend, Annie, came over before a party, had drinks, smoked, and fell asleep in his room. The author didn't think to inform his girlfriend, who was at a concert with a friend. The next day, he tells her, but she's upset because she feels there were previous boundary issues with Annie, like holding hands and playing with hair. Also, there was a conversation where they joked about threesomes, and the author mentioned Annie.\n\nNow, considering the girlfriend's perspective: She's in a two-year relationship, so trust and communication are important. The fact that she felt the need to bring up past behavior suggests she had concerns about the friendship. The author didn't realize how his actions affected her, even though he claims he meant no harm. The key points here are communication and the girlfriend's feelings of being neglected or insecure about the friendship.\n\nThe author didn't do anything intentionally wrong, but he failed to consider his girlfriend's feelings. Not informing her about Annie's sleepover could be seen as a lack of transparency. Even if it was a casual sleepover, the girlfriend's reaction is valid because she felt it crossed a line, especially with the prior context of the threesome conversation and Annie's behavior.\n\nHowever, the author didn't initiate the sleepover, and the situation happened without malicious intent. The main issue is the lack of communication. In relationships, it's important to be open about social interactions, especially when friends of the opposite sex are involved. The girlfriend's anger stems from feeling that her boundaries weren't respected, which the author didn't recognize.\n\nSo, while the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for the sleepover itself, he is at fault for not considering his girlfriend's feelings and past concerns. The answer would be A (Yes) because the author didn't communicate adequately, leading to misunderstandings and hurt feelings, even if unintentionally.\n"
