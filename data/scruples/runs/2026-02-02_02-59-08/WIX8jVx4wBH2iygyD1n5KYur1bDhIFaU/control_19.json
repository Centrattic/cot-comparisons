One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for having a sleepover with a female friend and not informing his girlfriend. The key points here are the context and the girlfriend's perspective.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author's friend (Annie) came over, they had drinks, watched TV, smoked, and fell asleep in his room. The girlfriend was at a concert. The next day, he told her, but she was upset. She brought up past incidents where Annie might have overstepped, like playing with his hair or holding his hand. The author didn't realize these bothered her. Also, there was a previous conversation where the author joked about having a threesome with Annie, which the girlfriend points out as a reason for her upset.\n\nFrom a relationship standpoint, trust and communication are crucial. Even if the sleepover was innocent, the girlfriend felt insecure. The fact that the author had previously mentioned Annie in a context of potential threesomes might have planted seeds of doubt. The girlfriend's reaction, while possibly overblown, stems from her feelings of insecurity. The author might be in the wrong for not considering how his actions could affect her, even if his intentions were good. Not checking in with his girlfriend before the sleepover could be seen as a lack of communication. However, if the intention was purely platonic and he didn't realize the impact, it's a communication issue on both sides. The answer isn't black and white, but since the girlfriend felt wronged and the author's past comments contributed, it's possible he's partially at fault. So leaning towards A.\n"
