One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for having a sleepover with his friend Annie when his girlfriend found out and got upset.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author and Annie, a female friend, had drinks, smoked, watched TV in his room, and fell asleep together. The girlfriend found out and was upset. She mentioned previous instances where Annie seemed to overstep, like playing with his hair and holding his hand at a festival. Also, there was a past conversation where they joked about threesomes, and the author mentioned Annie.\n\nSo, the key points are: the sleepover, the prior boundary issues, and the joke about threesomes. The girlfriend feels these things add up to the author being inconsiderate of her feelings and crossing boundaries she didn't realize were there.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, he didn't think he did anything wrong. He didn't initiate anything, and he didn't realize these actions bothered his girlfriend. However, the girlfriend's reaction seems to be about feeling unseen and the accumulation of these incidents, especially the mention of Annie in the threesome joke. That joke might have planted a seed in her mind, making her more sensitive to the sleepover.\n\nNow, considering relationship dynamics. Trust and communication are key. The author didn't consider his girlfriend's feelings when allowing Annie into his bed. Even if it was innocent, the act of having another person in the bed could be seen as a breach of trust, especially if the girlfriend felt it could lead to something more. The prior incidents (hair, hand-holding) might have made her feel insecure, and the joke about threesomes with Annie probably amplified her anxiety. The author's failure to notice her discomfort until she brought it up suggests he wasn't attuned to her emotional state, which is a red flag in a healthy relationship.\n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't have malicious intent. He thought the sleepover was harmless and didn't realize it would hurt her. But in relationships, it's not just about intent; it's about the impact. If his actions made her feel unimportant or insecure, then he's at least partially at fault for not addressing her feelings earlier.\n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. Since the girlfriend's reaction is valid from her perspective and the author didn't consider her feelings in his actions, there's a case to say he's in the wrong. The sleepover, combined with the previous boundary issues and the joke, created a situation where his girlfriend felt disregarded. Even if he meant no harm, the effect is what matters here. So, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because he didn't take his girlfriend's feelings into account and contributed to her insecurity by his actions and past behavior.\n"
