One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in a situation where they had a sleepover with a female friend that their girlfriend found out about and got upset.\n\nFirst, the key points from the story: The author's girlfriend is 20, and the friend is 22. The friend (Annie) came over, they had drinks, watched TV in the author's room, smoked, and fell asleep together. The author didn't inform the girlfriend, who was at a concert. The next day, the author told the girlfriend, but didn't think much of it. Later, the girlfriend confronts them about this and other incidents where Annie might have overstepped, like playing with the author's hair or holding hands at a festival. The author mentions they had joked about threesomes involving Annie, which the girlfriend now takes as a red flag.\n\nNow, considering the girlfriend's perspective: She's in a two-year relationship and feels that the author's actions and past jokes about threesomes with Annie could be a problem. Even if the author didn't mean anything by the sleepover or the previous interactions, the girlfriend's feelings are valid. Trust and communication are key in relationships. The author didn't ask for permission or consider how the girlfriend might feel about the sleepover, especially since there was a prior discussion about threesomes. The author's lack of awareness about the girlfriend's discomfort could be seen as a failure to communicate and respect her boundaries.\n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't initiate the sleepover, and the friend fell asleep accidentally. The author also didn't intend to hurt the girlfriend. However, the underlying issue is the past joke about threesomes, which the girlfriend now interprets as the author being open to that, even if it was just a joke. In relationships, even jokes can have weight if they relate to the partner's insecurities. The author's friend Annie's behavior might have been crossing boundaries, and the author's failure to notice or address that could be a problem.\n\nIs the author in the wrong here? It's a bit of a gray area. They didn't mean to do anything malicious, but they didn't consider the girlfriend's feelings or the context of previous discussions. The girlfriend's reaction is about feeling disrespected and not being communicated with. So, the author might share some responsibility for not being more transparent and for not recognizing the girlfriend's concerns earlier. However, the girlfriend might also be overreacting if the sleepover was innocent. But given the context of the prior joke about threesomes, the girlfriend's reaction is understandable. The answer might lean towards the author being a tiny bit in the wrong for not considering the implications of their actions and words, even if unintentionally.\n"
