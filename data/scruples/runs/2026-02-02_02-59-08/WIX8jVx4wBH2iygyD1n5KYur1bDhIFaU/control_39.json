One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong. The situation involves a girlfriend being upset because her boyfriend had a sleepover with a female friend in his bed, and there's some history of joking about threesomes.\n\nFirst, the key points: The author had a friend, Annie, who came over to his place, they ended up watching TV and falling asleep in his bed. The girlfriend found out later and was upset. She mentioned past instances where Annie crossed boundaries, like playing with his hair and holding hands. The author hadn't noticed these things bothered her. Also, there was a joke about threesomes where the author mentioned Annie's name, which the girlfriend points out as a contributing factor.\n\nNow, the girlfriend's reaction seems to stem from feeling that these interactions with Annie are crossing boundaries. Even if the author didn't intend anything wrong, the girlfriend's feelings matter in a relationship. The fact that he had a sleepover with another woman in his bed, especially when the girlfriend was out, might be a trigger for her insecurities. The prior jokes about threesomes involving Annie could have made the situation more sensitive. \n\nThe author didn't ask his girlfriend about the sleepover, which might have been a point of consideration. Even if it was accidental, not informing her could contribute to her feelings of being overlooked. The girlfriend's main issue seems to be the unawareness of her feelings and the potential for the author's actions to be misinterpreted, especially given the previous conversations about threesomes. \n\nHowever, the author didn't initiate the physical affection with Annie and didn't have intentions beyond friendship. The girlfriend acknowledges that he didn't do anything wrong but feels he was unaware of her feelings. The question is whether the author is at fault for not being more considerate or if the girlfriend overreacted. \n\nIn many relationships, communication is key. The author might not have realized the weight of his actions, but the girlfriend's reaction is valid if she felt hurt. The fact that he now is hyperaware and fears losing his friendship with Annie might be a consequence of the situation, but the root issue is about mutual understanding and respect for boundaries.\n"
