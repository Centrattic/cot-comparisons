One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for a situation involving their girlfriend and a friend. The author had a sleepover with his female friend in his room, which the girlfriend found out about and was upset. The girlfriend mentioned past instances where the friend crossed boundaries, like holding hands and playing with hair. The author didn't realize these actions bothered her until she brought it up. Also, there's a part where they discussed threesomes jokingly, and the author mentioned the friend.\n\nFirst, the main issue here is about boundaries in a relationship. The girlfriend felt uncomfortable with the friend being in the author's bed and the previous interactions. Even though the author didn't intend any wrongdoing, the key point in relationships is communication and respect for each other's feelings. The author didn't ask his girlfriend about the sleepover, which could be seen as a lack of consideration. The girlfriend pointing out the past interactions shows that there were prior issues she felt were unaddressed, which builds up to her current reaction.\n\nThe author's defense is that he didn't mean anything by the actions and loves his girlfriend. However, the girlfriend's perspective is valid because she felt that the friend's behavior was crossing lines. The author's failure to notice or address her concerns previously might have contributed to her feeling that her boundaries aren't respected. The mention of threesomes being discussed, even jokingly, could have added to her insecurities.\n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't initiate the sleepover and might have thought it was innocent. The situation with the friend could be seen as a normal friendship, but in the context of a relationship, even innocent actions can cause jealousy if boundaries are not clear. The author's hyper-awareness now shows that he's trying to adjust, but the initial lack of communication about the sleepover and prior interactions might make him partially at fault.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because he didn't consider his girlfriend's feelings and boundaries by not discussing the sleepover and prior interactions, even if he didn't have malicious intent. Relationships require open communication and respecting each other's comfort zones, which the author might have neglected here.\n"
