One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario involves a guy who had a sleepover with his female friend, Annie, in his room, and his girlfriend found out. The girlfriend was upset because the friend had previously acted in ways that made the girlfriend uncomfortable, like holding his hand at a festival. Plus, the author had joked about having a threesome with Annie in the past.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of the relationship. The girlfriend felt the situation was inappropriate and brought up past behaviors. The author didn't realize how his actions might have affected her. Also, the mention of the threesome joke might have made the girlfriend feel that the friendship crossed boundaries, even if it wasn't serious at the time.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author didn't ask his girlfriend about the sleepover, which could be seen as a breach of trust. Even if the sleepover was innocent, the girlfriend's feelings of insecurity and past concerns (like the hand-holding and the threesome joke) contributed to her reaction. The author might not have intended to hurt her, but not considering her perspective could be a mistake.\n\nOn the other hand, the author argues that the girlfriend blew it out of proportion. But the girlfriend's feelings are valid, especially if she felt that the friend's actions (and the author's past comments) indicated a lack of respect for their relationship boundaries. The author's failure to acknowledge her discomfort could be the issue here.\n\nSo, the author might be partially in the wrong for not being more mindful of his girlfriend's feelings and not communicating properly. Even if the actions themselves were innocent, the impact on the girlfriend matters. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A (Yes), but maybe there's nuance. However, considering the girlfriend's valid concerns and the author's role in not addressing them, I think A is more appropriate.\n"
