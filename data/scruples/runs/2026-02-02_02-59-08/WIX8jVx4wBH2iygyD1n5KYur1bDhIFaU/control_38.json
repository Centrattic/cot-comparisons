One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a guy who had a sleepover with his female friend, and his girlfriend got upset about it. The key points here are communication and boundaries.\n\nFirst, the guy didn't ask his girlfriend about the sleepover. Even though the friend was in a relationship, the main issue is that the guy didn't consider how his girlfriend might feel. They're in a two-year relationship, so communication is crucial. He mentions that they had talked about threesomes jokingly, and he even mentioned his friend, which might have added to the girlfriend's insecurity.\n\nThe girlfriend brought up past instances where the friend might have crossed boundaries, like playing with his hair and holding his hand. The guy didn't notice these things, but maybe he should have been more aware. Even if he didn't have intentions, his actions could be seen as neglecting his girlfriend's feelings.\n\nHe says he told her the next morning, but not immediately, which might have caused her to feel she wasn't in the loop. Also, after she expressed her feelings, he felt defensive and hyper-aware, which could affect their friendship. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because she felt uncomfortable, and the guy should have checked in with her before the sleepover.\n\nSo, the main issue is the lack of communication and not considering the girlfriend's perspective. Even if there was no malicious intent, the action was careless. The answer is likely A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
