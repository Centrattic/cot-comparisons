One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a guy who had a sleepover with his female friend in his room while his girlfriend was out. The girlfriend got upset because of past comments about threesomes involving that friend and some other interactions the guy didn't notice.\n\nFirst, the key points: The friend came over for drinks, they watched TV, smoked, fell asleep. The girlfriend wasn't home. The next day, the guy didn't think much of it, but the girlfriend later confronted him. She mentioned previous instances where the friend crossed boundaries, and there was a past joke about threesomes where he mentioned the friend. Now, he's worried about his friendship changing.\n\nSo, the author's actions. Did he do something wrong? Let's see. He had a friend over in his room, they fell asleep. But the girlfriend felt it was inappropriate. The main issue here is whether the guy's actions were a breach of trust or boundary-setting. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The guy didn't ask his girlfriend for permission or inform her beforehand. Even though he didn't mean anything by it, not discussing it with her first could be seen as neglecting her feelings. The girlfriend's reaction might be influenced by the past conversation about threesomes, which might have made her feel insecure. \n\nThe author says he didn't initiate anything, but the fact that the friend was in his bed alone could be a red flag for some partners. Even if they just fell asleep, the context of the previous joke about threesomes might have amplified her reaction. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It depends on the boundaries they had. If they had an open discussion about what's acceptable, and the guy crossed those lines without communication, then yes. But if the boundaries weren't clear, maybe the girlfriend overreacted. However, the key point is that the author didn't consider his girlfriend's perspective beforehand. In relationships, it's important to consider how your actions affect your partner, even if you don't see a problem. \n\nThe fact that the girlfriend felt it was inappropriate and brought up past issues suggests that the author should have been more mindful. Not informing her about the sleepover and not being aware of her concerns could be seen as his fault. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because he didn't communicate with his girlfriend and failed to consider her feelings, leading to her justified upset.\n"
