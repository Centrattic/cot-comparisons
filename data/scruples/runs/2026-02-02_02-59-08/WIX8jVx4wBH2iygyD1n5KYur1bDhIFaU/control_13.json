One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about whether having a friend sleep over and not informing the girlfriend is a big deal. The author is a guy in a two-year relationship, and his girlfriend got upset about this.\n\nFirst, the main issue is the sleepover. The author and his friend Annie fell asleep in his bed after drinking and smoking. The girlfriend found out the next day, and it seems like the author didn't think it was a big deal at first. But the girlfriend was upset because she felt it was inappropriate. Also, there were past instances where Annie was being affectionate with the author, like holding hands and playing with his hair when the girlfriend was around. The author hadn't noticed these things bothered her, even though he said he loves his girlfriend.\n\nThen there's the part where they used to joke about threesomes and the author mentioned Annie. That conversation might have made the girlfriend feel like the author is more open to that scenario with Annie, which could explain her anger. The author now feels like he's hyper-aware of his actions around Annie and fears the friendship might change.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, relationships often involve trust and communication. Even if the author didn't have any bad intentions, not considering his girlfriend's feelings and the potential for jealousy is a problem. The sleepover itself, while maybe innocent, could be seen as a breach of trust. Also, the past behaviors (holding hands, hair) might have been signs that the girlfriend was uncomfortable, and the author not noticing or addressing them shows a lack of awareness.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction might be seen as overblown by some, but in relationships, what matters is how each partner feels. The author's failure to communicate with his girlfriend about the sleepover and not being attuned to her discomfort in previous interactions could be his fault. Even if he didn't mean anything by it, his actions still caused hurt, so he might be at least partially responsible. The fact that the author mentioned Annie in a hypothetical threesome might have added fuel to the fire, making the girlfriend feel insecure.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend could be overreacting, but that doesn't mean the author isn't at fault. The key points are communication and respect for the girlfriend's feelings. The author didn't ask his girlfriend, which could be a mistake. So, I think the author is somewhat in the wrong for not being considerate enough and not communicating properly.\n"
