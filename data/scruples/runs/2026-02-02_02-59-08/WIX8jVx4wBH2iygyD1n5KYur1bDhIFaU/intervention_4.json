One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for having a sleepover with a friend and not informing his girlfriend. The situation involves a guy who had a friend (Annie) over, they watched TV, smoked, and fell asleep together in his room. The girlfriend found out later and was upset, partly because of a previous conversation where the guy mentioned considering a threesome with Annie. Now, the author feels the girlfriend overreacted.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of the relationship. The girlfriend is upset not just about the sleepover but also about past instances where Annie might have overstepped, like playing with his hair or holding his hand. The key point is communication. The author didn't inform his girlfriend about the sleepover, even though they had discussed threesomes in a joking manner. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction might be rooted in feeling insecure or not communicated with. Even if the author didn't have bad intentions, not discussing such a situation with his girlfriend could be seen as a breach of trust. Also, mentioning wanting a threesome with Annie, even in jest, could contribute to her feeling jealous or neglected.\n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't initiate the situation, and the sleepover happened without any malicious intent. He might not have realized the impact of his actions. However, the fact that they had discussed threesomes in a way that included Annie complicates things. The girlfriend's sensitivity here is understandable.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the main issue is not communicating with the girlfriend and considering her feelings, then the author might share some responsibility. The lack of communication and the prior joke about threesomes could have led to the girlfriend's justified insecurity. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A (author is in the wrong) because of the failure to communicate and consider the girlfriend's perspective.\n"
