One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" story is in the wrong. The situation involves the author (21M) having a sleepover with a female friend (Annie, 22F) in his room after a party, while his girlfriend (20F) was at a concert. The girlfriend got upset over this situation and mentioned past incidents where Annie crossed boundaries.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the girlfriend's perspective. She's in a two-year relationship, so she might feel insecure or threatened by the friend sleeping in the same bed as her partner. Even if the author didn't mean anything by it, the act of falling asleep in the same bed could be seen as a breach of trust, especially if there's a history of discussing boundaries. The author mentioned that they had joked about threesomes and which friends to sleep with. If Annie was someone they both considered for a hypothetical threesome, that might have made the girlfriend more sensitive about the situation. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might not have intended any wrongdoing. The friend fell asleep in his room without prior planning, and the author didn't initiate the sleepover. The author didn't even mention it to his girlfriend immediately, but that doesn't necessarily mean he was hiding something. However, the girlfriend felt that the author didn't notice her discomfort, which could indicate a lack of communication or awareness of her feelings. \n\nNow, considering the actual relationship dynamics: communication is key. The girlfriend brought up her feelings, and while the author might not have intended to hurt her, he should have been more mindful of how his actions affected her. Even if the actions themselves were innocent, the impact on the girlfriend is significant. The author's failure to recognize her boundaries and past concerns (like Annie's hand-holding and hair-playing) shows a lack of attention to her feelings. \n\nIn terms of the friendship with Annie, the author is now hyper-aware and fears losing the friendship. However, maintaining a healthy relationship requires balancing different relationships and respecting each other's boundaries. The author might need to adjust how he interacts with Annie to respect his girlfriend's feelings, even if the friendship is important to him. \n\nSo, the author's mistake wasn't necessarily the sleepover itself but not being aware of how his actions affected his girlfriend and not addressing her previous concerns. While the girlfriend might have overreacted, the author could have done more to communicate and reassure her. Therefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong), but there's nuance. The main issue is the author's lack of awareness and communication, not the sleepover itself.\n"
