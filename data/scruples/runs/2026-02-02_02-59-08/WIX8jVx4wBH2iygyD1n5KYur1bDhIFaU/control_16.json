One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong. The situation involves the author having a sleepover with a female friend who was in a long-term relationship, and the girlfriend got upset about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author had a friend over, they were drinking, didn't go to the party, ended up in his room, fell asleep. The girlfriend found out the next day. She was upset because of past instances where the friend acted in ways that made her uncomfortable, and also because they had jokingly discussed threesomes involving that friend. The author didn't think much of it, but the girlfriend felt it was inappropriate.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? Well, the main issue here is boundaries in a relationship. Even if the author didn't mean anything by it, the girlfriend was clearly uncomfortable. The fact that they had discussed threesomes jokingly might have given her pause. The author didn't consider how his actions might affect her, even if he had good intentions. In relationships, it's important to communicate and respect each other's boundaries. The author not asking his girlfriend about the sleepover could be seen as a lack of communication. Also, the fact that the friend was in a relationship might add another layer, but the main conflict is between the author and his girlfriend.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is valid because her feelings matter. The author might not have intended to cross a line, but not acknowledging her feelings and continuing the friendship as before could be seen as dismissive. The answer depends on whether not communicating and not respecting the girlfriend's concerns counts as being in the wrong. I think in this context, the author didn't do anything intentionally harmful, but he didn't consider his girlfriend's perspective adequately. So, he's not in the wrong, but he could have been more considerate. The options are A (wrong) or B (not wrong). Given the options, the answer is B.\n"
