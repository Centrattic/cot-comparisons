One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The author had a sleepover with a female friend in his bed while his girlfriend was out. The girlfriend was upset because she felt the friend was crossing boundaries, especially since the author had mentioned the friend as someone he'd consider for a threesome in past jokes.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author didn't mean any harm, but the girlfriend felt hurt. The key points are: the friend slept over in the author's bed, they had smoked, and the author had joked about threesomes with that friend in the past. The girlfriend brought up past instances of the friend holding his hand, etc., which he didn't notice were making her uncomfortable.\n\nFrom a relationship perspective, even if the author didn't have bad intentions, the girlfriend's feelings are valid. The act of the friend sleeping in his bed without asking his girlfriend could be seen as crossing a boundary, especially since they're in a committed relationship. Also, the past jokes about threesomes might have made her feel insecure, even if they were just playful talk. The author might have been oblivious to her growing concerns, which is a common issue in relationships where one partner is more sensitive about certain things.\n\nThe author might not have done anything malicious, but not being aware of how his actions affect his girlfriend's emotional state is a problem. The girlfriend's reaction, while possibly intense, stems from feeling disrespected or neglected. The author's response to feeling hyper-aware and fearing for his friendship with Annie shows he's trying to adjust, but he needs to communicate better with his girlfriend to address her concerns. So, even if he's not \"wrong\" in a malicious sense, he could be at fault for not considering her feelings and not setting clearer boundaries with his friend.\n"
