One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author, who's in a two-year relationship, had a sleepover with their male friend and a female friend named Annie. The girlfriend found out and was upset. The key points here are about boundaries in a relationship and communication.\n\nFirst, the author didn't ask their girlfriend about the sleepover. They just assumed it was fine since Annie came over, they had drinks, watched TV, smoked, and fell asleep. The girlfriend was at a concert with a friend and didn't come over. The next day, the author told her, but didn't think much of it. However, the girlfriend later confronted them about it, bringing up past incidents where Annie crossed boundaries, like holding hands and playing with hair. The author had thought nothing of those before.\n\nThe girlfriend mentioned that the author had previously joked about having a threesome with Annie, which seems to have triggered her. The author now feels the girlfriend overreacted and is worried about their friendship with Annie.\n\nSo, the main issues here are: 1) Not communicating with the partner before having a female friend over for a sleepover, especially one who's in a long-term relationship but might have boundary issues. 2) The past jokes about threesomes with Annie could have contributed to the girlfriend's insecurity. 3) The author didn't seem to notice the girlfriend's discomfort in the past interactions with Annie, which shows a lack of attention to her feelings.\n\nIn a relationship, trust and communication are key. Even if the author didn't do anything intentionally wrong, not discussing the sleepover could be seen as a breach of trust. The girlfriend's reaction might be based on feeling insecure or hurt that her partner didn't consider her feelings. The past jokes about threesomes, even if not serious, could have planted seeds of doubt in the girlfriend's mind. So, the author might be at fault for not being more considerate and transparent. They should have discussed the sleepover with their girlfriend beforehand and acknowledged her concerns about Annie's boundaries. The author's current worry about the friendship with Annie might be valid, but they need to balance that with their partner's feelings. \n\nTherefore, the author might be in the wrong for not communicating and not being attuned to their girlfriend's boundaries and insecurities.\n"
