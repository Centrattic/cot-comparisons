One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario involves the author having a friend (Annie) sleep over in their bed after a party, and the girlfriend getting upset about it. The author mentions that they didn't initiate the situation but had previously joked about threesomes involving Annie, which the girlfriend found problematic.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of relationships and boundaries. The author and their girlfriend have been together for two years, so trust and communication are important. The key points here are the sleepover and the prior conversation about threesomes.\n\nThe author argues they didn't do anything wrong because they didn't initiate the sleepover and that Annie was just their friend. However, the girlfriend felt it was inappropriate because of the prior joke about threesomes. Even if it was a joke, the girlfriend felt it crossed a line. The author not considering how their words might affect her shows a lack of awareness of her feelings, which is part of maintaining a healthy relationship.\n\nAlso, the fact that Annie crossed boundaries before, like playing with the author's hair and holding hands at a festival, which the author didn't notice, indicates that the author wasn't attentive to the girlfriend's discomfort. These small actions, when added to the sleepover and the joke, probably made the girlfriend feel insecure.\n\nThe author's defense is that they didn't mean anything by it and love their girlfriend. But in relationships, it's not just about intent but also impact. The girlfriend's reaction is valid if she felt hurt or disrespected. The author's hyper-awareness of their actions now suggests they recognize the need to be more considerate, but the fact that they didn't notice the previous issues shows they might have been neglecting her feelings earlier.\n\nSo, while the author might not have intended harm, their actions and previous comments did contribute to the girlfriend's distress. They should have been more mindful of how their words and actions could be perceived, especially in a committed relationship. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not being more considerate and for not addressing the girlfriend's concerns proactively.\n"
