One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for having a sleepover with their friend Annie and not informing their girlfriend. The situation involves the friend falling asleep in the author's bed after a party, and the girlfriend later expressing discomfort.\n\nFirst, the key points: The author and Annie had drinks, watched TV, smoked, and fell asleep. The girlfriend found out later and felt it was inappropriate. The author didn't initiate anything but didn't consider how their actions might make the girlfriend feel. The girlfriend's main issue seems to be past comments about threesomes and Annie's behavior in the past, like holding hands, which the author didn't notice.\n\nNow, considering relationships, communication is crucial. Even if the author didn't do anything intentionally, not being aware of the girlfriend's feelings could be a problem. The girlfriend felt that the sleepover and previous interactions with Annie crossed boundaries she had. The fact that they had discussed threesomes in the past, even jokingly, might have made her more sensitive here.\n\nThe author's mistake wasn't the sleepover itself but not considering how the girlfriend might feel about it and not communicating. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because her boundaries were crossed, even if unintentionally. The author should have been more mindful of her feelings and discussed the situation with her beforehand. \n\nSo, while the author didn't act with malicious intent, their lack of awareness and communication is where they're in the wrong. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
