One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for having a sleepover with a friend and not informing his girlfriend. The situation involves the author's friend, Annie, falling asleep in his bed after a night of drinking and doing drugs. The girlfriend was at a concert with a friend and didn't come over. The author tells her the next day but doesn't seem to think much of it until she brings up past incidents.\n\nFirst, the main issue here is the girlfriend's jealousy and the author's lack of awareness about her feelings. The author didn't initiate anything, but he also didn't consider how his actions might affect his girlfriend. The girlfriend mentions previous instances where Annie's behavior made her uncomfortable, like playing with his hair and holding hands at a festival. The author didn't notice these things, which suggests he wasn't attentive to her needs or boundaries.\n\nThen there's the part about discussing threesomes and mentioning Annie. Even if it was in a playful way, bringing up such topics can create tension, especially if one partner is more sensitive about boundaries. The girlfriend's main issue might not be the sleepover itself but the cumulative effect of Annie's behavior and the prior conversation about threesomes.\n\nThe author's defense is that he didn't mean anything by it and loves his girlfriend, but the problem is the lack of communication and awareness. In a relationship, it's important to be mindful of your partner's feelings and boundaries. The fact that the girlfriend felt the need to sit him down and explain things shows that she felt her concerns weren't acknowledged before.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since he didn't intentionally cross any lines but didn't consider his girlfriend's perspective, the fault isn't entirely on him. However, his lack of awareness and not addressing his girlfriend's concerns proactively could be seen as a failure to meet her emotional needs. The key here is that while he didn't do anything malicious, the situation was mishandled, leading to the girlfriend's distress. The answer might lean towards 'not in the wrong' because he didn't intentionally harm the relationship, but he could have been more considerate. However, the girlfriend's overreaction might be justified given the prior context. Hmm, tricky. Maybe the answer is B, No, because he didn't do anything wrong, but he's not entirely free from fault for not being more attentive. But according to the options, it's a binary choice. I think the answer is B because the author didn't intentionally do anything wrong, but the situation is more about communication and awareness than actual wrongdoing.\n"
