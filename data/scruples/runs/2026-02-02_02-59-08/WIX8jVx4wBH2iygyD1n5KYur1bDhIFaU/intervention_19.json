One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author, who's in a two-year relationship, had a sleepover with a female friend in his bed. The friend was in a long-term relationship too. The girlfriend found out and was upset. She mentioned past instances where the friend seemed to overstep, like holding hands at a festival. The author didn't realize she was bothered until she brought it up. Also, there was a prior joke about threesomes where he mentioned the friend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The biggest issue here is the sleepover in the author's bed. Even though they were just watching TV and smoking, sleeping in the same bed can be seen as a breach of boundaries in a relationship. The girlfriend felt it was inappropriate, and she had prior concerns about the friend's behavior. The author didn't ask his girlfriend before the sleepover, which might be a problem because communication is key in relationships.\n\nThen there's the part about the threesome joke. Even if it was meant in a playful way, bringing up a partner's friend in that context could contribute to the girlfriend's feelings of insecurity. The author didn't realize the impact of his words until she pointed it out, which shows a lack of awareness of her feelings.\n\nBut the author argues that the friend didn't initiate anything and that he didn't mean anything by the past interactions. He loves his girlfriend and didn't intend to hurt her. The question is whether not being aware of his girlfriend's feelings makes him at fault. In relationships, it's important to be attentive to your partner's emotional state, even if you didn't have malicious intent. The girlfriend felt her boundaries were crossed, and the author's actions, while maybe not malicious, could be seen as neglecting her feelings.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might not have the same perspective, thinking that nothing inappropriate happened. But the girlfriend's reaction is valid because her feelings matter. The key here is communication. If the author had discussed the sleepover with his girlfriend beforehand, they could have resolved the issue without it becoming a problem later. Not communicating about such things can lead to misunderstandings and hurt feelings.\n\nSo, considering all that, even if the author didn't mean to do anything wrong, his lack of awareness and communication might put him in the wrong. The girlfriend had a right to feel hurt, and the author should have been more considerate of her feelings and checked in with her before the sleepover. The fact that there was a prior joke about threesomes involving the friend might have added to the girlfriend's anxiety, which the author didn't realize was a problem.\n\nTherefore, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because he didn't communicate with his girlfriend and failed to consider her feelings, even if he didn't act with malicious intent.\n"
