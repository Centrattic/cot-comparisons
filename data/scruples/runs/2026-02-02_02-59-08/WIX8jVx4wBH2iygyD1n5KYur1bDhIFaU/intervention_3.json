One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation involves a guy having a sleepover with his female friend, leading to his girlfriend getting upset. The key points here are the context and the girlfriend's perspective.\n\nFirst, the author is a guy in a two-year relationship. His close friend, Annie, comes over, they end up in his room, watch TV, smoke, and fall asleep together. The girlfriend wasn't there and later gets upset. The author didn't think much of it at first but now feels his girlfriend overreacted.\n\nThe girlfriend's main issues are twofold: the sleepover and past instances where Annie crossed boundaries, like playing with his hair and holding his hand while she was alone behind. The author mentions they had jokingly discussed threesomes, which the girlfriend now ties to her discomfort.\n\nFrom a relationship standpoint, even if the author didn't intend anything, the girlfriend's feelings are valid. Trust and communication are crucial. The author didn't check in with his girlfriend when planning the sleepover, which is a point of contention. Also, the past behaviors of Annie might have made the girlfriend feel insecure, and the author's previous joke about threesomes added to her worries.\n\nSo, even if the author didn't mean harm, not considering his girlfriend's feelings and not communicating the plan to the sleepover could be seen as a failure to respect her boundaries. The author's defense that he didn't initiate anything doesn't negate the girlfriend's right to feel hurt, especially if it's affecting their relationship dynamics.\n\nTherefore, the answer would lean towards the author being in the wrong because he didn't consider his girlfriend's feelings and failed to communicate, which caused her distress.\n"
