One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. Let me read through the details again.\n\nSo, the situation is that the author (21M) had a sleepover with his close female friend Annie (22F) in his room after a party plan fell through. They ended up falling asleep together. His girlfriend (20F) found out later and was upset. She mentioned previous instances where Annie might have overstepped, like playing with his hair and holding his hand at a festival when the girlfriend was alone. Also, there was a conversation where they joked about threesomes and the author mentioned Annie. The girlfriend is upset not just about the sleepover but because of those past interactions and the context of their previous discussion on threesomes.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author did something wrong. Well, the main issue is having a friend over and sleeping in the same bed. But the girlfriend's reaction seems to be influenced by past behavior and the context of the threesome conversation. The author didn't initiate anything with Annie, but he was aware of Annie's boundary-pushing. The girlfriend feels hurt and like her feelings weren't considered because he didn't ask her. \n\nThe author didn't realize that these interactions bothered his girlfriend until she explained. Now, he feels the situation was blown out of proportion. The question is whether he's at fault. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. Even if the actions themselves (sleeping in the same bed, etc.) might not be inherently wrong, not discussing boundaries with the girlfriend could be an issue. The girlfriend's discomfort is valid because she feels her feelings weren't considered. The author might not have intended to hurt her, but he didn't check in with her about these interactions, especially given the past jokes about threesomes. \n\nHowever, the author didn't do anything with Annie, and Annie's actions were not his initiation. The problem is more about the girlfriend's perception and the lack of communication. So, the author might not be entirely at fault. But he could have been more considerate of how his actions, even if innocent, might affect his girlfriend. \n\nThe answer depends on whether not discussing with his girlfriend is a mistake. Since the girlfriend felt it was important and the author didn't realize her perspective until she brought it up, maybe he's partially at fault. But in the AITA context, they often look at intent and context. The author's intent was innocent, and he didn't have a malicious purpose. However, the girlfriend's feelings are valid. \n\nSo, the answer might be B (No), because the author didn't do anything intentionally wrong, but the situation highlights the need for better communication. The girlfriend's reaction is influenced by past interactions, and the author's lack of awareness about her feelings could be a point, but not necessarily making him wrong. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong, but there's room for improvement in communication.\n"
