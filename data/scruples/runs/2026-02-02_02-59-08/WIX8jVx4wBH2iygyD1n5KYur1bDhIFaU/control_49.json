One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for having a sleepover with his male friend and not informing his girlfriend. The situation is a bit complex, so I need to break it down.\n\nFirst, the setup: the author, a guy in a 2-year relationship, has his 21-year-old male friend Annie (22F) over for drinks before a party. They end up watching TV in his room, smoke some weed, and fall asleep. The girlfriend was at a concert and didn't come over. The next day, he tells her, but she gets upset later, bringing up past instances where Annie crossed boundaries, like playing with his hair or holding his hand at a festival. Also, there's a prior conversation where they joked about threesomes and the author mentioned Annie. Now the girlfriend is upset, and the author feels she's overreacting and is worried about his friendship with Annie.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider the key points.\n\n1. **Sleepover Situation**: The author and Annie had a sleepover in his room. The girlfriend wasn't there. The author didn't initiate anything, but they ended up sleeping in the same bed. The girlfriend found out later and felt it was inappropriate. The author didn't think it was a big deal at first.\n\n2. **Past Behavior**: The girlfriend points out that Annie had previously crossed boundaries (touching hair, holding hands at a festival). The author didn't notice these things bothered her, but he admits he loves his girlfriend. So, there's a history of Annie's behavior that the author might have overlooked.\n\n3. **Joking About Threesomes**: The author and girlfriend had a conversation about threesomes and the author mentioned Annie. Even though it was in jest, this might have planted a seed in the girlfriend's mind about the author's feelings towards Annie. The girlfriend might feel that suggesting Annie in that context makes the sleepover more problematic.\n\n4. **Communication Issues**: The author didn't communicate with his girlfriend about the sleepover until the next day. The girlfriend felt blindsided and then had to bring up past issues. The author didn't realize how his actions affected her, which could indicate a lack of awareness of her feelings.\n\n5. **Relationship Dynamics**: The girlfriend is in a long-term relationship, so she might have different expectations about boundaries with friends. The author's friendship with Annie might involve behaviors the girlfriend finds uncomfortable, especially since Annie is in a relationship herself.\n\nNow, considering all these factors. The author didn't do anything intentionally wrong, but he might have been unaware of his girlfriend's feelings. However, in a relationship, communication and consideration are key. The fact that the author discussed threesomes with Annie in a joking manner could have subconsciously influenced his girlfriend's reaction. Even if the author didn't mean anything by the past interactions with Annie, the girlfriend felt hurt, and the author should have been more attuned to her concerns. Not addressing her feelings proactively and only bringing it up after she reacted might be where he went wrong.\n\nAdditionally, while the sleepover itself might not be inherently wrong, the combination of past behavior and the joking about threesomes could make the girlfriend feel insecure. The author's failure to recognize her discomfort until after the fact suggests he might have been inconsiderate, even if unintentionally.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author might not be in the wrong in a strict sense, but he's definitely at fault for not being more considerate and communicative with his girlfriend. The answer is leaning towards AITA, but the question is whether he's in the wrong. Since the girlfriend's feelings are valid and the author didn't communicate properly, the answer might be A (Yes). However, some might argue it's not his fault entirely. But given the context, the answer is probably A.\n"
