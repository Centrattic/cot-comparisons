One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author having a sleepover with a female friend, Annie, without informing his girlfriend. The girlfriend is upset because of past conversations about potential threesomes where the author mentioned Annie. The key points here are about boundaries in relationships and communication.\n\nFirst, the author didn't do anything intentionally wrong. He had a sleepover with a friend in his room, which isn't inherently wrong. However, the girlfriend's perspective is important. She feels uncomfortable because of previous talk about threesomes and specific instances where Annie's behavior made her uneasy. Even if the author didn't mean anything by those actions, not considering how it might affect his girlfriend is a communication issue.\n\nThe girlfriend brought up her feelings, which is valid. Trust and transparency are crucial in relationships. The author didn't think to reach out to his girlfriend about the sleepover, which might have shown a lack of consideration for her feelings. The part about discussing threesomes and mentioning Annie adds another layer because it could make the girlfriend feel insecure. Even if it was just hypothetical, it's something that could be triggering for a partner.\n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't initiate any inappropriate actions. He had a friend sleep in his room, which is a common occurrence. The girlfriend's reaction might be seen as overblown if there's no history of jealousy or if the author's actions are clearly within boundaries. But since the girlfriend is feeling hurt and there's a history of her being uncomfortable around Annie, the author's lack of awareness is an issue.\n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for the sleepover itself, but he's at fault for not being more considerate of his girlfriend's feelings and not communicating with her. The answer might lean towards not in the wrong (B), but it's a bit nuanced. Since the girlfriend's feelings are valid, but the author didn't intentionally harm them, maybe B is correct.\n"
