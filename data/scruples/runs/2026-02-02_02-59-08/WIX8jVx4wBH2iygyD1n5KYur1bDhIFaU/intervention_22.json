One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong. The situation involves the author, their girlfriend, and their friend Annie. The key points are:\n\n1. The author had a sleepover with Annie (22F) while the girlfriend was away. They drank, smoked, watched TV, and fell asleep in the same bed. The author didn't think it was a big deal and told the girlfriend the next day. The girlfriend was upset about this, especially because of past instances where Annie had touched the author (like playing with hair, hand-holding). Also, the author had mentioned Annie in hypothetical threesome discussions before.\n\n2. The girlfriend feels the situation was inappropriate and that the author didn't notice how his actions affected her. The author now feels the girlfriend overreacted and is worried about his friendship with Annie.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is at fault. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the main issue is the sleepover. Even though the author didn't intend anything romantic, sharing a bed with a friend can be a boundary issue in a relationship. The girlfriend had a right to feel upset because it could be seen as a breach of trust. The fact that they were in the same bed and asleep together, especially after alcohol and weed, might make it more sensitive. The girlfriend's reaction could stem from insecurity or past experiences.\n\nThen there's the history of Annie touching the author, which the author didn't perceive as a problem. If the author was aware of these interactions and didn't correct them, that might contribute to the girlfriend's feelings of being disregarded. Also, the mention of Annie in the hypothetical threesome conversation could have made the girlfriend feel the author had a preference for Annie, which adds to her distress.\n\nThe author's perspective is that he didn't do anything wrong, but the girlfriend's feelings are valid. The problem is that the author didn't consider how his actions affected his girlfriend, even if it wasn't intentional. In relationships, communication is key. The author didn't foresee the issue, but he should have been more attuned to his girlfriend's boundaries and feelings, especially after the prior discussions about hypothetical scenarios.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might have overreacted, but her feelings are real. The author's friend Annie's behavior (touching, holding hands) and the previous conversation about threesomes could have made the situation more sensitive. The author's lack of awareness might be the issue here.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author might be in the wrong for not being mindful of his girlfriend's feelings and for not maintaining appropriate boundaries with Annie, even if he didn't have bad intentions. The answer would likely be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
