One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for having a sleepover with a female friend and not informing his girlfriend, leading to some conflict.\n\nFirst, the author had a friend over to his room, they ended up falling asleep. The girlfriend found out later and was upset. The key points here are the lack of communication and the previous conversation about threesomes. Even though the author didn't initiate anything, not telling his girlfriend about the sleepover could be seen as a breach of trust. In relationships, transparency is important, especially when there's a history of discussing boundaries. The friend was already in a relationship, but the fact that they were in the author's bed together might make the girlfriend feel jealous or neglected. Also, the author had mentioned Annie in the context of threesomes before, which probably made the girlfriend more sensitive. The author's not noticing the boundaries in their behavior, like the friend being too familiar, could add to the issue. So while nothing physical happened, the lack of communication and the prior comments might have contributed to the girlfriend's feelings. The answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong for the specific incident but maybe in the wrong for not considering the girlfriend's feelings and the context. However, the main question is about the sleepover and the reaction. Since the author didn't do anything wrong in the act itself but failed to communicate, the answer might be B (No), but there's a nuance. The girlfriend's overreaction could be partly due to the prior conversation about threesomes. The author might not be in the wrong for the sleepover, but the problem lies in the communication and the previous comments. The user initially thought the author is in the wrong, but based on the scenario, maybe the girlfriend is concerned about the potential for overstepping, so the author isn't at fault for the sleepover itself. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
