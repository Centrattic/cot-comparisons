One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for having a sleepover with a friend and not informing his girlfriend. The main points are:\n\n1. The author had a friend, Annie, come over, they ended up in his room, fell asleep. The girlfriend found out and was upset. \n2. The girlfriend mentioned past instances where Annie might have crossed boundaries, like holding hands and playing with hair while the girlfriend was nearby. The author didn't notice this before.\n3. The girlfriend brought up a past conversation where they joked about threesomes and the author mentioned Annie, which seems to have triggered her feelings now.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, he didn't mean any harm, didn't initiate anything, and thought it was just a sleepover. But the girlfriend feels it was inappropriate and that the author didn't consider her feelings. \n\nThe key here is about communication and boundaries. Even if the author didn't intend anything, the girlfriend felt uncomfortable. In a relationship, it's important to be transparent about social interactions, especially when they involve other people in bed. The fact that they didn't invite the girlfriend along and the girlfriend felt left out might contribute to her feelings.\n\nAlso, the past jokes about threesomes coming up now makes it more complex. The girlfriend might feel that the author's choice of friend for such a scenario is a provocation, even if it was a joke before. The author's not noticing the girlfriend's discomfort in previous situations (like the hand-holding) suggests he might not have been fully aware of her boundaries, which is a problem.\n\nBut the author didn't do anything intentionally wrong. He didn't have an affair or anything physical. However, the issue is more about the girlfriend's emotional response and the author's lack of awareness. In a committed relationship, partners need to communicate their boundaries and the author might have failed to recognize the girlfriend's discomfort in past instances.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. On one hand, he didn't do anything malicious. On the other, he didn't consider his girlfriend's feelings and past concerns, which could have led to this situation. The answer might depend on whether the author should have been more attentive to his girlfriend's feelings and boundaries, even if they weren't explicitly stated. Since the girlfriend pointed out that the author didn't notice her discomfort before, maybe the author is partly at fault for not being more attuned to her emotions.\n"
