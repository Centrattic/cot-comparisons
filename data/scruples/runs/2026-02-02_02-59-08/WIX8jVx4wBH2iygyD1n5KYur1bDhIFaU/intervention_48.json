One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation involves a guy who had a sleepover with his female friend when his girlfriend was at a concert. They drank, smoked, and fell asleep in his room. The girlfriend later confronted him about it, citing past incidents where the friend crossed boundaries.\n\nFirst, the main issue here is the sleepover. Even if the intention was innocent, the fact that the friend was in the same bed after drinking and smoking could be seen as a breach of trust, especially in a relationship. The girlfriend's reaction might be influenced by the previous conversation about threesomes, which the author mentioned. That context could make her feel insecure or that the friend is a threat. \n\nThe author didn't ask his girlfriend about the sleepover, which is a red flag. Open communication is key in relationships, and not discussing such a situation could be seen as neglecting to consider her feelings. Also, the girlfriend pointed out past instances where the friend overstepped, which the author hadn't noticed. That suggests a pattern of behavior that the author is either ignoring or downplaying. \n\nHowever, the author claims he didn't intend anything inappropriate and truly loves his girlfriend. The girlfriend admitted he didn't act with malice, but she's hurt because he didn't realize her discomfort. So, while the author might not have done anything malicious, his lack of awareness and communication could be problematic. \n\nThe question is whether the girlfriend overreacted. The author's actions, while not malicious, might have triggered her insecurities. The fact that he mentioned the friend in a hypothetical threesome conversation adds to her anxiety. The author's response to feel that his girlfriend blew it out of proportion might indicate a lack of empathy towards her feelings. \n\nIn relationships, it's important to consider how your actions affect your partner, even if you don't see them as harmful. The author's failure to recognize his girlfriend's concerns and the potential impact on their trust might place some responsibility on him. However, the girlfriend's reaction is also influenced by her own insecurities and past interactions. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. He didn't act with intent to hurt, but he should have been more communicative and empathetic to his girlfriend's feelings. The key issue is the lack of communication and not considering his girlfriend's perspective, which could make him partially responsible. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A.\n"
