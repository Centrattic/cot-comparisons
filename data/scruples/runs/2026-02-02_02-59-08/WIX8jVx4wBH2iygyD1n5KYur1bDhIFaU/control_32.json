One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's see. The situation is that the author (21M) had a sleepover with his friend Annie (22F) who's in a long-term relationship, and didn't tell his girlfriend (20F). They were at the author's place, had drinks, smoked, ended up sleeping in his bed. The girlfriend found out later and was upset, especially because they had previously joked about threesomes and the author mentioned Annie.\n\nFirst, the key points: The author didn't ask his girlfriend, which is a problem because communication is important in relationships. Even if it was accidental or not intentional, not informing her shows a lack of consideration for her feelings. The girlfriend's reaction seems to stem from past conversations about threesomes, which may have made her feel that the author's actions were a setup or a betrayal, even if it wasn't meant that way.\n\nAlso, the friend Annie is in a relationship herself, so the fact that she came over and stayed the night in the author's bed could be seen as crossing boundaries, especially if the author's girlfriend is aware of Annie's relationship status. The author didn't notice the things Annie was doing (like playing with his hair, holding hands) that the girlfriend found problematic, which suggests he might not have been paying attention to her feelings or the girlfriend's comfort level.\n\nThe girlfriend did say the author didn't do anything wrong but that he didn't notice her discomfort. However, the underlying issue is the lack of communication and the prior mention of threesomes involving Annie, which the author now realizes might have contributed to the problem. \n\nSo, the author's actions, while not malicious, were careless in terms of communication and awareness. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because boundaries in relationships are about mutual respect and transparency. Even if the author didn't mean to hurt her, the act of not discussing it and the prior jokes about threesomes with Annie likely made her feel insecure and disrespected. \n\nTherefore, the author is somewhat at fault for not being proactive in maintaining open communication and for not being attentive to his girlfriend's feelings regarding his interactions with Annie.\n"
