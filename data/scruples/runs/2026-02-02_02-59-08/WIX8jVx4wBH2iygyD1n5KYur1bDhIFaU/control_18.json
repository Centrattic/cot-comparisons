One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. The key points are: the author had a sleepover with their female friend Annie, who ended up in his bed after a party incident. The girlfriend found out and was upset, citing past instances where Annie was physically affectionate. The girlfriend was also upset because the author mentioned Annie in a hypothetical threesome conversation. The author now feels the situation was blown out of proportion and is worried about his friendship with Annie.\n\nFirst, the core issue here is the girlfriend's jealousy and the author's actions. The author didn't intentionally do anything wrong, but there's a lack of communication and consideration for the girlfriend's feelings. Even though the sleepover was accidental, the fact that the friend was in the same bed could be triggering for a girlfriend. The author didn't ask or tell his girlfriend beforehand, which might have been a mistake. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because she felt her boundaries were crossed, especially with the previous instances of affectionate behavior. The hypothetical threesome conversation, even if not serious, might have added fuel to the fire, making the girlfriend feel insecure.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong? Well, if the girlfriend expressed discomfort before, the author should be more mindful. The author didn't do anything on purpose, but negligence in being aware of how his actions affect his girlfriend could be a point. The question is whether the actions were inappropriate. Since the sleepover was accidental and the author didn't initiate anything, maybe he's not in the wrong. However, the fact that the friend was in the bed and the past behaviors might make the girlfriend's reaction justified. But the author didn't act with malice, so the answer might be B. But some might argue that the author should have been more attentive to the girlfriend's feelings, leading to A. Need to decide based on the context.\n"
