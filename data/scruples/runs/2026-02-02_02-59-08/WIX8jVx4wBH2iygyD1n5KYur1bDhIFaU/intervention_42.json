One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the story) is in the wrong. The situation involves a girlfriend being upset because the author had a sleepover with a female friend in his bed without asking her. The friend, Annie, fell asleep in his room after drinking and smoking. The girlfriend was at a concert and didn't come over. The author didn't think much of it until his girlfriend confronted him, pointing out that the sleepover and previous interactions (like Annie playing with his hair and holding his hand) were making her uncomfortable. Also, the author had mentioned in a hypothetical conversation about threesomes that he'd consider Annie, which the girlfriend found hurtful.\n\nSo, the key points here are about boundaries in a relationship. The author didn't think about how his actions might affect his girlfriend's feelings. Even though he didn't intend anything wrong, his girlfriend was clearly hurt. The fact that the author had mentioned Annie in the context of threesomes, even in a hypothetical way, probably made the situation worse because it showed he associated Annie with that context. The girlfriend's main issue seems to be that the author didn't consider her feelings and didn't notice the signs that she felt uncomfortable. \n\nThe author might argue that he didn't do anything intentionally wrong, but relationships often involve communication and awareness of each other's feelings. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because she felt disrespected or neglected. The author should have been more mindful of their relationship dynamics, especially when friends are involved. He also needs to be aware that even if the actions weren't malicious, they can still hurt someone he cares about. \n\nSo, even if the author didn't mean to, he is in the wrong for not considering his girlfriend's feelings and for not heeding the previous subtle signs that Annie might be crossing boundaries. The hypothetical comment about threesomes also likely exacerbated the situation. The answer should be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
