One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author, a guy, had a sleepover with his female friend Annie, who's 22 and in a long-term relationship. The girlfriend found out and got upset. The author didn't ask her beforehand, and now he's feeling like she blew it out of proportion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the girlfriend's perspective. She's in a two-year relationship with the author. Trust and communication are important in relationships. The fact that the author didn't inform her about the sleepover might be a big deal for her. Even if they were just watching TV and fell asleep, having someone else in the bed can feel like a breach of trust. Plus, the girlfriend mentioned previous instances where Annie crossed boundaries, like playing with the author's hair and holding his hand at a festival. Those might have been red flags she was already concerned about, but the author didn't notice.\n\nThe author's argument is that he didn't do anything intentionally. He claims he didn't initiate anything and that Annie fell asleep there. Also, he thought he was just hanging out with a friend. But the girlfriend's main issue might be about the lack of communication and the prior comments about threesomes. The author mentioned that in the past, they joked about threesomes and who they'd choose, and he picked Annie. That could have made the girlfriend feel insecure, even if it was a joke.\n\nNow, from a relationship standpoint, partners often have boundaries about friends of the opposite sex. The author might not see the issue because he and Annie are just friends, but if the girlfriend feels uncomfortable, then the author should respect that. The fact that he didn't communicate with her about the sleepover is a problem. Even if it was innocent, not discussing it with his girlfriend shows a lack of consideration for her feelings.\n\nAlso, the author is now hyper-aware of his behavior around Annie because of the girlfriend's concerns. That's natural, but he's worried about the friendship. However, maintaining trust in the relationship is more important than just preserving the friendship with Annie. If Annie's presence makes the girlfriend uncomfortable, the author should manage that by being clear about boundaries and respecting his girlfriend's feelings.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author didn't necessarily do anything malicious, but the lack of communication and the prior jokes about threesomes likely contributed to the girlfriend's hurt feelings. The key issue here is whether the author considered his girlfriend's perspective and communicated appropriately. Since he didn't ask her and didn't consider her potential discomfort, especially with the history of jokes about threesomes, he might be in the wrong for not being more mindful and communicative with his girlfriend.\n"
