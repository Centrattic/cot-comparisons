One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for having a sleepover with their male friend and a female friend without asking their girlfriend. The situation involves a couple where the girlfriend is upset because her boyfriend had a friend (Annie) sleep in his bed after they both fell asleep. The girlfriend points out past instances where Annie was affectionate towards the boyfriend, and there was a prior joke about threesomes.\n\nFirst, the main issue here is about the girlfriend's boundaries and how the boyfriend handled the situation. Even though the sleepover didn't involve anything inappropriate, the key point is that the boyfriend didn't consider his girlfriend's feelings or communicate about it. The girlfriend felt it was inappropriate, especially given their previous discussion about threesomes, which might have made her more sensitive to Annie's presence and interactions.\n\nThe boyfriend didn't ask his girlfriend before having Annie over, which shows a lack of communication and consideration. Even if he didn't have intentions of anything happening, the fact that he didn't check in with his girlfriend is problematic. The girlfriend's reaction, while maybe intense, is partly because she felt her boundaries were ignored. The boyfriend's hyper-awareness now might be a consequence of not addressing her feelings earlier.\n\nAdditionally, the prior conversation about threesomes, even if not taken seriously, might have planted seeds of insecurity in the girlfriend. The boyfriend didn't take her concerns seriously when she mentioned Annie's other boundary-crossing actions before. His not noticing how she felt then contributes to the current situation.\n\nSo, while the sleepover itself might not have been wrong, the lack of communication and consideration for the girlfriend's feelings definitely is. The author is in the wrong because he didn't respect her boundaries and didn't take her previous concerns seriously.\n"
