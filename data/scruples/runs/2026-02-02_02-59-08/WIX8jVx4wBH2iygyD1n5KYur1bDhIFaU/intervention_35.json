One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for having a sleepover with a friend and not informing his girlfriend. The situation involves the author's friend, Annie, who is in a long-term relationship, staying over in his room. They drank, watched TV, smoked, and fell asleep. The girlfriend found out later and was upset, mentioning past instances where Annie crossed boundaries. The author says he didn't realize it bothered her and now feels she's overreacting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the girlfriend's perspective. She's in a two-year relationship, so she likely expects some level of transparency and consideration for her feelings. The fact that they had talked about hypothetical threesomes and he mentioned Annie might have planted seeds of insecurity. Even if the author didn't intend anything, not discussing the sleepover could be seen as a breach of trust. Also, the previous boundary issues (like hand-holding) indicate patterns that the girlfriend noticed but the author didn't, which shows a lack of awareness to her feelings.\n\nOn the other hand, the author claims he didn't initiate anything and thought nothing of it. He might not have meant to hurt her, but the key here is communication. In relationships, even if something seems harmless, not considering the partner's perspective can lead to issues. The girlfriend's reaction is about feeling her boundaries were disrespected, and the author's lack of communication exacerbates the problem. The fact that he now fears it's affecting his friendship with Annie isn't the main issue; the main issue is the impact on the relationship.\n\nThe author's defense is that he didn't do anything wrong, but the problem is more about how his actions made his girlfriend feel. Even if the actions themselves were innocent, the lack of communication and disregard for her feelings is where he's at fault. So, the answer is A\u2014he's in the wrong because he failed to consider his girlfriend's feelings and communicate properly.\n"
