One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for having a sleepover with his male friend and not informing his girlfriend. The situation is a bit complex.\n\nFirst, the main issue is that the friend, Annie, slept in his bed while the girlfriend was out. The author didn't think to tell his girlfriend about it. The girlfriend was upset because she felt there were boundaries crossed, especially considering past conversations about threesomes and Annie's behavior. The author didn't mean anything by it, but he didn't realize how it made his girlfriend feel.\n\nSo, from a relationship perspective, communication is key. The author didn't ask his girlfriend before having the sleepover, which could be a problem. Even if the situation wasn't intentional, not considering her feelings shows a lack of communication. The girlfriend mentioned past incidents too, like Annie playing with his hair and holding hands. So, the author might be in the wrong for not being mindful of his actions in the presence of his girlfriend, even if he didn't have bad intentions.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is valid because she felt insecure. The author's defense is that he didn't do anything on purpose, but in relationships, intentions aren't the only thing that matters\u2014perceptions and communication do. Also, the mention of past conversations about threesomes might have made the girlfriend more sensitive. \n\nBut then again, the author didn't have any malicious intent. He and Annie were just friends, and they fell asleep together. However, the fact that he didn't think to mention it to his girlfriend shows a lack of consideration. So, maybe he's partially at fault. The key here is whether the author should have known that his actions could hurt his girlfriend, even if it wasn't intentional. In relationships, being proactive about communication and considering the partner's feelings is important. So, even if he didn't mean to, not asking or informing could be seen as a mistake. Therefore, the answer might be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
