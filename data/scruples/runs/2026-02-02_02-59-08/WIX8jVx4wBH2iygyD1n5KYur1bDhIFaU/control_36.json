One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for having a sleepover with a female friend without telling his girlfriend. Let's look at the details.\n\nFirst, the author's friend, Annie, came over to drink, then stayed to watch TV and smoked marijuana. They fell asleep in his room. The girlfriend found out later and was upset. The key points here are whether the author crossed any boundaries in his relationship.\n\nThe girlfriend's main issues are that the author didn't ask her about the sleepover and that there were previous instances where Annie was overly affectionate. The author didn't intend anything by those actions but didn't notice they upset his girlfriend. Also, there's the mention of discussing threesomes with friends, where the author mentioned Annie, which the girlfriend brings up as context for her hurt feelings.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author didn't inform his girlfriend about the sleepover, which could be a breach of trust. Even if the intention was innocent, not discussing it shows a lack of awareness of his girlfriend's feelings and boundaries. The fact that the girlfriend mentioned previous concerns about Annie's behavior and the author didn't realize they were bothering her suggests he wasn't attentive enough to her perspective.\n\nThe author's defense is that he didn't initiate anything and didn't think it was a big deal. However, the girlfriend's reaction indicates that she felt ignored and her boundaries weren't respected. The mention of the threesome joke adds context that the author's comment about Annie might have been a trigger for her insecurity.\n\nSo, while the author may not have intended harm, his actions (not communicating, not noticing her discomfort) contributed to the conflict. He's in the wrong for not being considerate of his girlfriend's feelings and for not maintaining open communication in the relationship.\n"
