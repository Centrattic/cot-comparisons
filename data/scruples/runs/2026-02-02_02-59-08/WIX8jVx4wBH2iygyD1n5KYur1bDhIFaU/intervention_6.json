One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for a situation involving a sleepover with a friend and the girlfriend's reaction.\n\nFirst, the key points: The author (21M) had a friend (Annie, 22F) over to watch TV and smoke. They fell asleep in his bed. The girlfriend (20F) found out and was upset. She mentioned past instances where Annie was affectionate, like holding hands and playing with hair, which the author didn't think much of. The author also mentioned Annie in the context of hypothetical threesomes, which the girlfriend pointed out as a trigger.\n\nThe author feels the girlfriend overreacted and is now worried about his friendship with Annie. He's unsure if he's at fault. The question is whether the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B).\n\nConsidering relationship dynamics, trust is crucial. Even if there's no intention, actions can affect a partner's comfort. The author didn't inform his girlfriend about the sleepover, which might be a breach of communication. Also, mentioning Annie in hypothetical scenarios about threesomes could be seen as insensitive, especially if the girlfriend didn't know that was a sensitive topic.\n\nHowever, the author didn't initiate the sleepover and didn't have intentions beyond friendship. The girlfriend's reaction is about past and present actions that made her uncomfortable. The author might be at fault for not considering her feelings earlier, especially after discussing threesomes. Not addressing her concerns proactively could be a mistake.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend is within her rights to feel uneasy, and the author's lack of awareness might be part of the issue. The fact that the author didn't ask his girlfriend beforehand shows a lack of consideration for her feelings, which could justify her reaction. The problem isn't just the sleepover but the cumulative effect of past behaviors and the hypothetical comments.\n\nSo, balancing both sides, the author might be partially at fault for not communicating and not foreseeing how his actions could make his girlfriend feel. Even if there was no malice, the lack of awareness and communication could make him wrong. So leaning towards A.\n"
