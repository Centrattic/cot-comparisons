One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on the situation they described. The author had a friend over, they ended up sleeping in the same bed, and didn't inform their girlfriend. The girlfriend was upset about this and also mentioned past incidents where the friend might have been too familiar. The author feels the girlfriend overreacted and is now worried about their friendship with Annie.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the relationship dynamics. The author and their girlfriend are in a two-year relationship, so trust and communication are important. The key points here are the sleepover without informing the girlfriend, the past behavior of the friend, and the conversation about threesomes.\n\nThe sleepover itself: Even if it was innocent, not informing the girlfriend could be a breach of trust. The girlfriend might feel neglected or insecure, especially if they have discussed boundaries before. The fact that the author didn't even mention it right away but told her the next morning might not be enough. In relationships, transparency is key, so not including the girlfriend in the loop could be seen as a problem.\n\nThen there's the history of the friend's actions. The girlfriend pointed out that the friend had touched the author's hair and held hands at a festival. The author might not have realized how these actions made their girlfriend feel. Even if the author didn't intend anything, the girlfriend's perspective is valid. The friend's behavior could be crossing boundaries the girlfriend is not comfortable with.\n\nThe conversation about threesomes is significant. Even if it was hypothetical, bringing up the idea of having a threesome with the friend could be a red flag. The girlfriend might feel that the author is more open to that scenario than she is, leading to her insecurity. The author's mention of Annie in that context might have planted seeds of doubt, even if it wasn't meant seriously.\n\nThe author now feels the situation is blown out of proportion, but from the girlfriend's viewpoint, the accumulation of events (sleepover, past interactions, the threesome joke) could justify her feelings. The author's lack of awareness about how his actions affect the girlfriend shows a possible lack of communication. The author might not be intentionally wrong, but not considering the girlfriend's feelings and boundaries is a mistake.\n\nIn relationships, it's important to be considerate of each other's feelings. The author's actions might not be malicious, but they have caused distress. The girlfriend's reaction, while perhaps intense, is a valid response to feeling insecure and not being respected. The author needs to take responsibility for not communicating and not being aware of the girlfriend's perspective. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
