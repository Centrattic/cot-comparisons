One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for having a sleepover with a female friend and not informing his girlfriend. The author's girlfriend got upset because she felt it was inappropriate and brought up past instances where the friend might have overstepped boundaries.\n\nFirst, the main issue here is the sleepover. The author and his friend fell asleep in the same bed after drinking and smoking pot. Even if it was unintentional, the context matters. The girlfriend wasn't there, and the author didn't inform her. In relationships, transparency is important. Even if there's no physical intimacy, the act of being alone with someone else can be a trigger for insecurity or jealousy, especially if there's a history of discussing boundaries.\n\nThe author mentioned that they had joked about threesomes and mentioned this friend, which might have planted seeds of doubt in the girlfriend's mind. Even if it was just playful talk, the girlfriend could see that as a red flag. The author not noticing how the friend's actions made her feel (like playing with hair and holding hands) shows a lack of awareness of her partner's feelings. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction might seem exaggerated, but her feelings are valid if she felt ignored or disrespected by the author not considering her perspective. The author's defense that he didn't initiate anything might be true, but in a relationship, both partners need to be mindful of each other's comfort levels. \n\nAlso, the author's fear of the friendship with Annie changing might stem from guilt or realizing that the situation could have been handled better. The key here is communication. The author didn't check in with his girlfriend about his plans, which is a basic step in maintaining trust. \n\nSo, while the author might not have intended harm, his actions (not informing his girlfriend) and lack of awareness of her feelings make him partially responsible. Therefore, he's at least partially in the wrong.\n"
