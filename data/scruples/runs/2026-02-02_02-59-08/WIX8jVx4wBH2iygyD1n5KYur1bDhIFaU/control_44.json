One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe author, a guy in a two-year relationship, had a friend named Annie over. Annie is in a long-term relationship herself. They had drinks, went to a party, but then decided not to go and ended up in his room watching TV, smoking weed, and fell asleep. His girlfriend was at a concert with a friend and went back to her place instead. He told her the next morning that Annie was in his bed. A few days later, when they met again, the girlfriend confronted him seriously, saying it was inappropriate and mentioned past instances where Annie had touched him in ways that bothered her, like playing with his hair and holding his hand. The author didn't think these meant anything and loves his girlfriend. The girlfriend did say he didn't do anything wrong, but he didn't notice it bothered her. The key point she brought up was a past conversation where they joked about threesomes and the author mentioned Annie. Now the author feels like his girlfriend is overreacting and he's worried about his friendship with Annie. The question is, is the author in the wrong?\n\nFirst, let's consider the main points. The author allowed a friend (Annie) to fall asleep in his bed after they had been drinking and doing drugs together, and he didn't inform his girlfriend beforehand. His girlfriend was upset not just about the sleepover but also past behaviors where Annie had crossed boundaries (touching him). The girlfriend had previously discussed threesomes with the author, but when he mentioned Annie in that context, it seems to have triggered her current feelings. \n\nNow, the author's perspective is that he didn't mean anything by the interactions with Annie and that he didn't initiate the sleepover. However, the girlfriend's feelings are valid. Even if the author didn't intend anything, the actions might have made the girlfriend feel insecure. The fact that they had joked about threesomes and he mentioned Annie might have made the girlfriend feel that he was objectifying Annie or that the sleepover situation was a potential red flag. \n\nIn relationships, communication and mutual boundaries are key. The author didn't consider how his actions might affect his girlfriend's feelings, even if they were unintentional. While the girlfriend might have overreacted in the author's opinion, her feelings are important, and the author should have been more attentive to her boundaries from the start. For example, allowing a friend to sleep in the bed without informing the girlfriend could be seen as crossing a line, especially if the girlfriend has previously expressed discomfort with Annie's behavior. The author might not have done anything malicious, but not considering his girlfriend's perspective could be seen as a failure to maintain the trust in the relationship. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might be overreacting if there's no history of the author being unfaithful or intentionally hurting her. However, the fact that they had discussed threesomes and he mentioned Annie might have planted a seed of doubt in her mind. The author's failure to notice the past behaviors that upset her could indicate a lack of attentiveness to her needs, which is a problem in communication. \n\nSo, in terms of right or wrong, relationships are about mutual respect and understanding. The author may not have done anything explicitly wrong, but his lack of awareness and not considering how his actions affected his girlfriend could be seen as a mistake. The answer might be B (No, not in the wrong) because he didn't intend harm, but the situation is more about the girlfriend's feelings being valid. However, if the question is about whether the author is in the wrong for not being more considerate, then maybe A (Yes). But typically in AITA scenarios, the focus is on whether the action itself is wrong, not just the feelings. Since the author didn't have ill intent and the girlfriend acknowledged he didn't do anything wrong, the answer is likely B.\n"
