One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person in the situation (the author) is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author having a sleepover with a female friend who ended up in his bed while his girlfriend was out. The girlfriend got upset because of this and also mentioned past behaviors, like the friend holding his hand when the girlfriend was nearby. The author feels the GF overreacted and is worried about his friendship with Annie.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author might not have intended anything wrong, but the girlfriend's feelings are valid. In relationships, even unintentional actions can cause hurt if they make a partner feel insecure. The fact that the author had mentioned Annie in hypothetical threesome conversations might have added to the girlfriend's discomfort, making the situation more sensitive.\n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't plan the sleepover and didn't initiate any inappropriate actions. He reported the event honestly once the next day. The friend was already there, and they both fell asleep. However, the girlfriend's concern is about the boundaries and how the friend's behavior might be perceived. The key here is whether the author should have been more considerate of his girlfriend's feelings by not having the friend over in the first place, especially given the prior discussions about threesomes.\n\nThe author's failure to consider his girlfriend's perspective and the prior context might have led to her feeling neglected or insecure. Even if the actions were innocent, the impact on his girlfriend matters. So, the author might be at fault for not anticipating how his actions could affect her, even if he didn't mean harm. On the flip side, the girlfriend's reaction could be seen as over-the-top if there's no history of jealousy or if the actions were clearly innocent.\n\nBut given that there was prior talk about threesomes, the girlfriend's perspective is understandable. She might feel that the author's openness about such fantasies with another girl makes the situation more problematic. The author's not noticing the girlfriend's discomfort also shows a lack of attentiveness to her feelings, which is a relationship issue.\n\nSo, putting it all together, while the author didn't do anything malicious, he might be in the wrong for not considering his girlfriend's feelings and not setting clearer boundaries with his friend. The answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because he should have been more mindful of his girlfriend's perspective and the potential for misunderstanding.\n"
