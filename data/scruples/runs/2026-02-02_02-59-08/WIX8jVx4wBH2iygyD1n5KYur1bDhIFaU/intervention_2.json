One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author having a sleepover with a female friend, Annie, in his room without informing his girlfriend. The girlfriend got upset about it and mentioned past instances where Annie crossed boundaries. The author is feeling conflicted between his girlfriend's feelings and his friendship with Annie.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points in the scenario. The author and Annie had a sleepover in his room. While the initial plan was just to watch TV and have drinks before a party, they ended up falling asleep together. The girlfriend found out later and felt it was inappropriate, especially because they had previously discussed fantasies about threesomes involving Annie. The author didn't mean anything by the interactions but didn't consider how his actions might affect his girlfriend. \n\nThe girlfriend's main issues are the physical boundaries and the fact that the author didn't notice her discomfort in previous interactions with Annie. The author's defense is that he didn't initiate the overstepping, but he also didn't pay attention to his girlfriend's feelings. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nIn relationships, communication and respecting the partner's feelings are crucial. Even if the author didn't intend to hurt his girlfriend, not being aware of her perspective and the boundaries she has is a problem. The fact that they had discussed threesomes in a joking manner might have added to the girlfriend's anxiety, even if it wasn't serious. The author's failure to recognize her valid concerns about Annie's behavior could be seen as a lack of consideration. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might not have realized the impact of his actions. However, in a committed relationship, it's important to be mindful of your partner's comfort levels. Letting a friend sleep in the same room, especially when the partner was not invited, can be a breach of trust. The author should have either been more cautious about the situation or communicated better with his girlfriend. \n\nSo, even if the author didn't intend to do anything wrong, the lack of awareness and communication might make him partially responsible. The girlfriend's reaction, while perhaps intense, is about her boundaries and how she feels about the situation. Therefore, the author could be in the wrong for not being more considerate and proactive in addressing his girlfriend's feelings.\n"
