One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a guy who had a sleepover with his friend Annie (female) in his room, and his girlfriend found out and is upset. The guy says he didn't do anything wrong because he didn't initiate it, but his girlfriend is upset. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author and his girlfriend have discussed threesomes and the guy mentioned Annie as someone they'd consider. That might be a big part of why the girlfriend is upset. Even if the sleepover was innocent, the fact that he mentioned Annie in the context of threesomes could make the girlfriend feel insecure or that boundaries were crossed. \n\nThe author didn't ask his girlfriend before the sleepover, which is a point against him. In a relationship, communication is key. Even if the actions themselves seem harmless, the lack of communication about friends and boundaries can lead to misunderstandings. The girlfriend felt it was inappropriate because of past conversations they had, so the author should have been more considerate of her feelings in light of that.\n\nAlso, the girlfriend mentioned previous incidents where Annie crossed boundaries, like holding hands or playing with hair while the girlfriend was alone. The author didn't notice these things, which shows he might not have been fully aware of how his actions affected his girlfriend. \n\nBut the author argues that he didn't do anything wrong because he didn't initiate the sleepover and he didn't have intentions with Annie. However, in a relationship, even if the actions are innocent, the perception and past conversations matter. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because her feelings are hurt by the mention of Annie in the context of threesomes, which makes the sleepover seem more problematic.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? The key points are lack of communication and not considering his girlfriend's past concerns. Even if the actions were innocent, he didn't think about how his girlfriend would feel, especially given their previous discussions. That makes him at least partially at fault. Therefore, the answer might be A.\n"
