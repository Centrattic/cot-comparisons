One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves the author having a friend (Annie) sleep over in their room after a party, leading to the girlfriend being upset. The key factors here are the relationship dynamics and expectations.\n\nFirst, the author and Annie fell asleep together. The girlfriend found out later and was upset, especially because of past instances where Annie might have been too familiar. The author said they didn't mean anything by it and love their girlfriend. The girlfriend acknowledged the author didn't initiate anything but was upset about the boundary crossing. \n\nNow, why was the girlfriend upset? It's about trust and boundaries in a relationship. Even if the author didn't have ill intentions, the act of having a friend (especially one the couple has joked about in a sexual context) sleep in the same bed could be seen as crossing a line. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because she feels her feelings were overlooked. The author didn't consider how this might affect their partner, even if it was unintentional. \n\nAlso, the mention of the threesome conversation adds context. The girlfriend might feel like the author's offhand comment about Annie in that scenario made the situation more uncomfortable. The author's not noticing that Annie's actions bothered the girlfriend shows a lack of awareness of their partner's feelings. \n\nSo, even though the author didn't mean to do anything wrong, the situation could be seen as inconsiderate. The girlfriend's reaction is about boundaries and respect, which are important in a relationship. The author is in the wrong because they didn't consider their partner's perspective and feelings, even if their actions were accidental.\n"
