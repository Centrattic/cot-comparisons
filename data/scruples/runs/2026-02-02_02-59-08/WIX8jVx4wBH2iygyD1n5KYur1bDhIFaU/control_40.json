One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nSo, the author is a guy in a 2-year relationship with his girlfriend. He had a friend, Annie, over for drinks and ended up watching TV in his room, smoking, and then both fell asleep in his bed. The girlfriend found out later and was upset. She mentioned past instances where Annie had touched him (hair, hand-holding) which he didn't think were a big deal. She also brought up a conversation where they joked about threesomes and he mentioned Annie. Now he's feeling like his girlfriend is overreacting and he's worried about his friendship with Annie.\n\nFirst, let's consider the girlfriend's perspective. She's clearly hurt and felt that the sleepover crossed a boundary. Even though the author didn't initiate anything, the fact that Annie was in his bed and they both fell asleep there could be seen as inappropriate, especially in a relationship where boundaries are important. The girlfriend also pointed out past behaviors that might have made her feel insecure, which the author didn't notice. That suggests there might be a history of him being too familiar with Annie in her presence, which could erode trust.\n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't have any intention of being inappropriate. He thought the sleepover was just a hangout that coincidentally ended in both of them being in his bed. He also clarifies that he loves his girlfriend and hasn't initiated anything. However, the issue might not just be the sleepover itself but the context. The fact that they discussed threesomes jokingly and he mentioned Annie might have triggered her insecurities. Even if it was a joke, it could have made her feel like he's considering being with someone else, which is a red flag in a relationship.\n\nThe author is now hyper-aware of his actions around Annie because of this, which might indicate he understands why his girlfriend is upset. The key here is whether the author is at fault for the sleepover or if the girlfriend's reaction is reasonable given the context. \n\nIn relationships, communication and mutual understanding of boundaries are crucial. The author might not have intended to hurt his girlfriend, but by having Annie over and not considering her feelings (like the past interactions and the joke about threesomes), he might have inadvertently crossed a line. Not checking in with his girlfriend about how she feels about him and his friends' interactions, especially after they had mentioned threesomes, could be seen as neglecting her emotional needs.\n\nSo, while the author might not have done anything malicious, the situation is a result of not being attuned to his girlfriend's feelings and boundaries. Therefore, he could be at fault for not being considerate enough of her perspective, even if the actions themselves seem innocent on the surface.\n"
