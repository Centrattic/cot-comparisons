One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a guy who had a sleepover with his female friend, not his girlfriend, and the girlfriend is upset about it. The key points here are the context of their relationship, the specific actions taken, and the girlfriend's perspective.\n\nFirst, the author had a friend over for drinks and a TV time, leading to both falling asleep in his bed. The girlfriend was at a concert and wasn't at home. The author didn't inform her beforehand. The girlfriend later confronts him, pointing out that his friend had crossed boundaries in the past, like holding his hand when she was nearby, and also mentions a previous joke about threesomes where he mentioned that friend.\n\nNow, from a relationship standpoint, communication is key. Even if the author didn't have any intentions, not informing the girlfriend about the sleepover could be seen as a breach of trust. The girlfriend's anger might stem from feeling excluded or not respected, especially since they've discussed boundaries before. The fact that the friend in question has a history of crossing boundaries (hand-holding, etc.) adds another layer. The author might not have realized how these previous actions and the sleepover could make his girlfriend feel insecure or worried about his fidelity.\n\nHowever, the author didn't initiate the sleepover and it was a result of their friend bailing. Still, the girlfriend's reaction is valid because she felt it was inappropriate. The author's failure to notice her discomfort in the past (like the friend's hand-holding) shows a lack of awareness of her feelings. The mention of a previous joke about threesomes involving the same friend might have triggered her, making her see this sleepover as a possible escalation she didn't want.\n\nSo, while the author didn't act with bad intentions, the lack of communication and failure to consider his girlfriend's feelings and past concerns could make him at fault. The girlfriend's reaction, though, is also understandable given the history. It's a bit of a grey area, but the author's negligence in not addressing her potential concerns and not checking in with her before the sleepover likely contributes to being in the wrong.\n"
