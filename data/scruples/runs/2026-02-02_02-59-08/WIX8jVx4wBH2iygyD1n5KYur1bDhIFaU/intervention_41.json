One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author (21M) had a sleepover with his female friend Annie (22F), who ended up sleeping in his bed. The author didn't tell his girlfriend (20F) until the next day. The girlfriend got upset, especially because there was prior talk about threesomes and which friends they would sleep with, and Annie was mentioned. The author feels the girlfriend overreacted.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the girlfriend's perspective. In a relationship, communication and trust are key. Even if the author didn't have any intentions, the fact that a girl slept in his bed could be a red flag for some people. The girlfriend mentioned previous instances where Annie crossed boundaries, like holding his hand and playing with his hair while the girlfriend was nearby. The author might not have seen those as issues, but the girlfriend did, and that builds up over time.\n\nThen there's the part about the threesome talk. Even if it was just a joke, mentioning Annie specifically could make the girlfriend feel insecure. It's a natural reaction for someone in a relationship to want to know where their partner's lines are drawn. The author might not have realized how those comments affected her.\n\nOn the other side, the author didn't ask for permission, which isn't typical in relationships, but not involving the girlfriend in decisions that might affect her trust is a problem. The author might not have seen the situation as a big deal, but the girlfriend's feelings are valid. The fact that the author is now hyper-aware of his actions around Annie suggests that maybe he didn't consider how his behavior could be perceived, even if unintentionally.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author's actions were wrong. The key points are the lack of communication, the prior boundary issues with Annie, and the mention of threesomes. The girlfriend's reaction is about feeling disrespected and not being considered in those decisions. The author might not have meant anything by it, but in a relationship, partners need to be mindful of each other's feelings and boundaries. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not being more aware and communicative, even if he didn't intend to hurt anyone.\n"
