One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario involves the author having a sleepover with a female friend in their room, not informing their girlfriend, and the girlfriend getting upset about it. The author feels the reaction was blown out of proportion.\n\nFirst, the author's actions: they had a friend over, they ended up in the same bed, and didn't tell their girlfriend. The girlfriend is upset because she feels boundaries were crossed, especially considering previous instances where the friend was overstepping, like holding hands and playing with hair when the girlfriend was nearby. Also, there was a prior joke about threesomes involving that same friend. \n\nThe key points here are about trust and communication in a relationship. Even if the author didn't intend anything inappropriate, not informing their girlfriend about having a female friend over in the same bed could be seen as a breach of trust. The girlfriend's reaction is based on her feelings of insecurity and past conversations, which the author didn't notice before she pointed them out. The author's argument is that they didn't mean anything by it, but relationships require being considerate of the other's feelings and boundaries.\n\nThe author's defense is that they didn't initiate the situation and that they love their girlfriend. However, the lack of communication is a problem. Even if the friend ended up in the bed accidentally, the author should have informed their girlfriend to prevent misunderstandings. The fact that there was prior joking about threesomes involving the same friend might have contributed to the girlfriend's anxiety, making her reaction more about past issues than the current event. \n\nThe author is now hyper-aware of their actions around the friend, fearing the friendship will change. But the main issue is whether the initial action was wrong. In relationships, transparency is important. Not being upfront about interactions with others, especially in a potentially compromising situation, can lead to hurt feelings. The author didn't consider how their actions might affect the girlfriend's feelings, even if there was no malicious intent. \n\nSo, while the girlfriend's reaction might be intense, the author's failure to communicate and consider their partner's feelings does place some responsibility on them. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for not being transparent and for not being mindful of how their actions could be perceived, given the past context.\n"
