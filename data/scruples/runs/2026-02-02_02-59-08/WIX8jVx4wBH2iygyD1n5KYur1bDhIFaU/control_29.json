One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for having a sleepover with his friend Annie and not asking his girlfriend. The situation is a bit complex, so I need to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the main points from the story: The author and Annie, a 22F friend who is in a long-term relationship, had drinks, smoked some weed, and fell asleep in his room. His girlfriend was at a concert and didn't come over. He told her the next day, and she was upset. She mentioned past incidents where Annie had crossed boundaries, like playing with his hair and holding his hand at a festival. But he didn't think anything of it. Also, there was a previous conversation where they jokingly discussed threesomes, and he mentioned Annie. Now the girlfriend is angry, and the author is worried about his friendship with Annie.\n\nSo, the key issues here are communication and boundaries in a relationship. The author didn't ask his girlfriend before having Annie sleep over, even though they're close friends. The girlfriend is upset because she feels this is inappropriate, especially since there was that previous joke about threesomes. The fact that the author didn't realize this bothered her suggests a lack of awareness or communication on his part.\n\nEven though the author didn't initiate the physical contact or the sleepover intentionally, the issue is that he didn't consider his girlfriend's feelings or check in with her. In a relationship, transparency is important. If they had discussed their boundaries beforehand, maybe this situation could have been avoided. The joke about threesomes, even if not serious, might have made the girlfriend feel that the author is open to situations that she finds uncomfortable. \n\nAlso, the fact that Annie is in a long-term relationship might not matter as much to the girlfriend if the author's actions made her feel insecure. The author's friend Annie might not have realized the implications of her actions (like holding hands with the author) if the girlfriend had mentioned it before. However, the author should have been more in tune with his girlfriend's potential discomfort, especially after that prior conversation.\n\nThe author's reaction of feeling hyper-aware and fearing the friendship will change is his own emotional response. The question is about whether he's in the wrong. From a relationship standpoint, not consulting with his partner about having a friend sleep over, especially when there's prior talk about such scenarios, could be seen as a breach of trust or misunderstanding of boundaries. So even if he didn't mean anything by it, the girlfriend's feelings are valid, and the author might need to take responsibility for not being more considerate.\n"
