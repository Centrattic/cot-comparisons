One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong. The situation is about a guy who had a sleepover with his friend and didn't tell his girlfriend. The key points here are about communication and boundaries in a relationship.\n\nFirst, the author didn't inform his girlfriend about the sleepover. Even if they were both out and decided not to go to the party, the fact that a female friend ended up sleeping in his bed might be a red flag for some people. The girlfriend was upset because she felt the boundaries were crossed, especially considering past comments about threesomes. \n\nThe author says he didn't do anything intentionally wrong but didn't consider how his actions made his girlfriend feel. Even though he didn't initiate the sleepover, he didn't check in with her. In relationships, communication is key. If the girlfriend mentioned before that she's uncomfortable with certain behaviors, ignoring those feelings can be seen as dismissive.\n\nAlso, the fact that the author now feels hyper-aware around his friend might affect their friendship, but that's a consequence of not addressing the issue properly. The girlfriend's reaction is about her emotional response to past and present actions, which are valid in a relationship context. \n\nSo, while the author might not have meant harm, he failed to communicate and consider his girlfriend's feelings, leading to her feeling upset. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for not addressing her concerns and not being mindful of her boundaries.\n"
