One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author had a sleepover with his female friend Annie (22F) and didn't inform his girlfriend (20F). They both ended up falling asleep in his bed. The girlfriend found out later and was upset, especially because there was a previous conversation where they joked about threesomes and the author mentioned Annie.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author and Annie were at a party, their friend bailed, so they stayed in the author's room to watch TV and smoked. They fell asleep. The girlfriend was at a concert with a friend and went back to her place. The next day, the author told her about Annie sleeping over. The girlfriend was upset because she felt the author was unaware of Annie's previous boundary-crossing behaviors, like playing with his hair and holding his hand while the girlfriend was nearby. Also, the joke about threesomes with Annie mentioned by the author might have contributed to her feeling.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break down the factors:\n\n1. **Communication with the girlfriend**: The author didn't inform his girlfriend about the sleepover immediately. He told her the next morning but didn't realize how it might affect her. The girlfriend felt that he didn't consider her feelings, which is a valid point. In a relationship, transparency is important, especially when it comes to friends of the opposite gender.\n\n2. **Intent vs. Impact**: The author didn't intend to hurt his girlfriend, and he didn't initiate the sleepover. However, his actions (having a female friend sleep in his bed) can be seen as a breach of trust, especially if the girlfriend felt it was inappropriate. Even if the author didn't have malicious intent, the impact on the girlfriend matters in a relationship.\n\n3. **Previous conversation about threesomes**: The girlfriend was upset because the author had joked about a threesome involving Annie. This might have made her more sensitive to the situation, as it could be perceived as the author not being exclusive or not taking the relationship seriously. Even if it was just a joke, mentioning another person in that context can be hurtful.\n\n4. **Friendship with Annie**: The author is now worried about his friendship with Annie changing, which is a valid concern, but it's important to balance that with the girlfriend's feelings. The girlfriend might feel that the author is prioritizing his friendship over their relationship.\n\n5. **Annie's behavior**: Annie had crossed boundaries before, like holding his hand at a festival when the girlfriend was nearby. The author didn't see that as a problem, but the girlfriend did. This shows a difference in how they perceive appropriate boundaries in the relationship.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author's actions (not informing his girlfriend, allowing a friend to sleep over in his bed, and the previous joke) could be seen as inconsiderate, even if he didn't mean to hurt her. The girlfriend's reaction is about the emotional impact and the lack of communication, which are significant in a relationship. However, the author might not have had ill intentions. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. On one hand, he didn't do anything explicitly wrong like cheating or being intentionally cruel. On the other hand, he didn't consider his girlfriend's feelings and boundaries, which are crucial in a relationship. The fact that he mentioned Annie in a hypothetical threesome might have contributed to the girlfriend's hurt feelings. \n\nTherefore, while the author didn't act with malice, he is somewhat at fault for not being more communicative and sensitive to his girlfriend's boundaries. The answer might lean towards A, but there are nuances. However, given the girlfriend's valid concerns and the author's lack of awareness, it's a case where the author is partially in the wrong, so the answer is A.\n"
