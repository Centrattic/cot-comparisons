One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person in the story is in the wrong. Let's break down the situation.\n\nSo, the author (21M) had a sleepover with his female friend Annie (22F) after they were supposed to go to a party but didn't. They ended up in his room, watched TV, smoked, and fell asleep. The girlfriend (20F) was at a concert with a friend and didn't come over. The next day, he told her and didn't think much of it. Later, the girlfriend got upset because she felt this was inappropriate and brought up past instances where Annie crossed boundaries, like holding his hand when the girlfriend was nearby. The key point she mentioned was a conversation where they joked about threesomes and the author mentioned Annie, which made her feel insecure. Now the author is wondering if he's in the wrong for not seeing her perspective and being upset about the situation affecting his friendship with Annie.\n\nHmm. Let's consider the dynamics here. First, the author and Annie fell asleep in his bed. Even if it was accidental, the girlfriend might feel that sleeping in the same bed is crossing a line, especially if they're in a relationship. The girlfriend's main issue might be about boundaries and feeling insecure. The author didn't realize that his actions, even if innocent, made her uncomfortable. The conversation about threesomes, even as a joke, could have planted seeds of doubt in the girlfriend's mind, making her more sensitive to the sleepover situation. \n\nThe author didn't intend to hurt her, but the fact that he didn't consider her feelings in the moment is a problem. In relationships, communication and awareness of the partner's feelings are crucial. Even if the actions weren't malicious, not being attuned to the girlfriend's insecurities is a misstep. The girlfriend's reaction might seem over the top, but her feelings are valid. The author's friend Annie might have been crossing boundaries in the past, which the author didn't notice, leading to this conflict. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, he didn't do anything intentionally harmful, but his lack of awareness and not considering his girlfriend's perspective is a mistake. The answer might be B (No) because he didn't act maliciously, but there's a case that he should have been more mindful of her feelings. But in the context of the question, which asks if he's in the wrong, maybe the answer is B because intent matters. However, the fact that he didn't take her feelings into account could mean he's partially at fault. Wait, the girlfriend said he didn't do anything wrong, just that he didn't notice it bothered her. So maybe he's not in the wrong per se, but the situation highlights a need for better communication. The answer is likely B.\n"
