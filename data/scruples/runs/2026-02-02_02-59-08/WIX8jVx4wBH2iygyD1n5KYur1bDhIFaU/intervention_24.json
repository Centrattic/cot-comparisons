One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for having a sleepover with a female friend and not informing his girlfriend. The situation is a bit complex because of the dynamics between the people involved.\n\nFirst, the main issue here is the girlfriend's reaction. The author didn't do anything that's clearly against the rules, but the girlfriend felt uncomfortable. The key points are that the friend fell asleep in the author's bed, and there was a prior conversation about threesomes where the author mentioned the friend. \n\nThe author's defense is that he didn't initiate anything and didn't mean for the girlfriend to be upset. However, the girlfriend feels that the situation was inappropriate, especially given the past discussion about preferences in threesomes. The author's lack of awareness about how his actions affected his girlfriend is a red flag. Even if the actions themselves weren't malicious, the girlfriend's feelings are valid and shouldn't be dismissed. \n\nAlso, the fact that the author now feels hyper-aware and worried about his friendship with the friend because of the girlfriend's reaction complicates things. The author might not have realized the importance of the girlfriend's boundaries. In relationships, communication and considering each other's feelings are crucial. Even if the author didn't do something wrong in a strict sense, not being mindful of how his actions could affect his girlfriend makes him partially at fault.\n\nSo, considering both sides, the answer might be that the author is in the wrong for not being considerate enough of his girlfriend's feelings, even though he didn't intentionally harm the relationship. The answer would lean towards A.\n"
