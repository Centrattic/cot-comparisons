One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is a guy in a two-year relationship with his girlfriend. He had a sleepover with his female friend Annie, who is in a long-term relationship. They watched TV in his room, smoked some weed, and fell asleep. The girlfriend found out later and was upset, especially because there was a previous conversation where the author mentioned wanting to have a threesome with Annie, even if it was in a joking or hypothetical way.\n\nFirst, the main issue here is the sleepover itself. The girlfriend felt that the sleepover was inappropriate, especially considering the prior discussion about threesomes. Even though the author didn't have any intentions and Annie is in a relationship, the act of having a sleepover alone in his room could be seen as crossing a boundary, particularly if the girlfriend felt it could lead to something more. The fact that he didn't ask her about the sleepover first is a key point. In relationships, communication is crucial. If there's a prior discussion about hypothetical threesomes, even if not serious, the girlfriend might feel that it's a red flag when combined with the sleepover situation.\n\nThe author claims he thought nothing of it, but the girlfriend's reaction suggests that his actions, though not intentional, might have been perceived as dismissive of her feelings. The previous joke about the threesome with Annie might have made the sleepover more hurtful to her. The fact that she was at a concert with a friend and he went back to their place instead of joining them adds another layer of possible neglect or lack of consideration, though that might be a separate issue.\n\nThe author's fear of changing his friendship with Annie is understandable, but the girlfriend's feelings are valid too. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. He didn't initiate the sleepover or the overstepping, but he didn't prevent it either. His not noticing that she was bothered could be a sign of not being attuned to her feelings, which is a common issue in relationships. The prior joke about the threesome with Annie might have unintentionally given her a sense of permission or created an environment where she felt more comfortable crossing boundaries, which the author didn't address at the time.\n\nSo, considering the girlfriend's perspective and the prior context, the author might have been negligent in being aware of how his actions and previous words could affect her. Even if he didn't do anything wrong in a legal or explicit sense, the emotional impact and the lack of communication could mean he's partially at fault. The answer would be A, yes, the author is in the wrong because he didn't consider his girlfriend's feelings and possibly reinforced an uncomfortable situation with his previous comments.\n"
