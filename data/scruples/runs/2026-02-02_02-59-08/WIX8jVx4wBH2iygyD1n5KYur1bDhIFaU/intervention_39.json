One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong. The situation involves a guy who had a friend sleep over in his bed without telling his girlfriend. The girlfriend is upset, especially because they had previously discussed hypothetical threesomes and the friend's behaviors that made her uncomfortable.\n\nFirst, the key points: The author didn't ask his girlfriend about the sleepover. Even though they were just friends, not a couple, in a dating relationship, communication is important. The girlfriend felt it was inappropriate, especially considering the previous discussions about threesomes. The fact that the friend was in the same bed and they both fell asleep there could be seen as cross boundaries, especially if the girlfriend wasn't informed. The author didn't consider how his actions might affect his girlfriend's feelings, even if he didn't have intentions. The girlfriend brought up past instances where the friend overstepped, which the author hadn't noticed. \n\nThe author's defense is that he didn't mean anything by it and loves his girlfriend, but not addressing her concerns and the past behavior might contribute to her feeling of betrayal. Also, the fact that he had joked about threesomes with her, including this friend, might have made her feel that the situation with the friend was a real concern. \n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't initiate the sleepover; it just happened. He didn't have any malicious intent. The girlfriend is being very sensitive about past hypothetical conversations and past minor overstepping by the friend. \n\nBut in a relationship, trust and communication are key. Not informing the partner about a friend sleeping in your bed, especially when there are prior concerns, can be seen as a breach of trust, even if unintended. The girlfriend's feelings are valid, and the author should have been more considerate. So, the author might be in the wrong for not communicating and not being aware of his girlfriend's discomfort with the friend's behavior.\n"
