One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation involves a guy who had a sleepover with his female friend, Annie, in his room, and his girlfriend was upset about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author and Annie were going to a party but their friend bailed, so they stayed in to drink and smoke. They ended up falling asleep in his room. The girlfriend found out the next day and was upset. She mentioned past incidents where Annie crossed boundaries, like playing with his hair and holding his hand at a festival. The author didn't realize these things bothered her until she brought them up. Also, there was a previous conversation where they joked about threesomes and the author mentioned Annie, which might have added to the girlfriend's hurt.\n\nNow, the author feels his girlfriend is overreacting, and he's worried about his friendship with Annie. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nFrom a relationship perspective, trust and communication are important. Even if the author didn't intend to do anything wrong, the fact that he had a sleepover with a female friend without informing his girlfriend could be a breach of trust. The girlfriend's reaction might be based on feeling that her partner is not respecting her feelings or the boundaries they should have in their relationship. \n\nAlso, the past behavior with Annie (like hand-holding) and the joke about threesomes might have set off the girlfriend's insecurities. Even if the author didn't mean anything by it, not being aware of how his actions affect his partner could be a problem. In relationships, it's important to be mindful of the partner's feelings and to communicate openly about boundaries.\n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't initiate anything inappropriate during the sleepover, and Annie was in a relationship herself. The situation might have been a misunderstanding or a lack of communication. However, the fact that the girlfriend felt the need to bring up past issues suggests that there were prior concerns that the author didn't address, which could contribute to her current reaction.\n\nSo, considering that the author didn't ask his girlfriend about the sleepover, didn't consider her potential feelings, and had a history of casual interactions with Annie that the girlfriend found troubling, he might be in the wrong. The key issue is not the sleepover itself but the lack of communication and not being attuned to his girlfriend's feelings regarding boundaries.\n"
