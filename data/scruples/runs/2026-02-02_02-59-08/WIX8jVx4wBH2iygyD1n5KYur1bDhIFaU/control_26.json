One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for having a sleepover with a female friend and not considering their girlfriend's feelings. The situation involves Annie, a 21-year-old male friend, coming over, they end up in the same room, drinking, smoking, and falling asleep. The girlfriend found out later and was upset, especially because they had jokingly talked about threesomes involving Annie.\n\nFirst, the core issue is the girlfriend's comfort and the boundaries in the relationship. Even if the author didn't intend anything inappropriate, the fact that they didn't communicate with their girlfriend about the plans or the events that led to Annie sleeping over could be a problem. Relationships typically require transparency and consideration of each other's feelings. The author might have assumed it was okay since they didn't initiate anything, but not checking in with their partner can lead to misunderstandings.\n\nThen there's the history of discussing threesomes with Annie, even if it was just in a playful or hypothetical way. The girlfriend might have felt that bringing up such scenarios, even jokingly, with a friend who then ends up in the same bed could be seen as a breach of trust, even unintentionally. The author's lack of awareness about Annie's past behavior (like playing with hair and holding hands) suggests there might have been previous signs the girlfriend noticed that the author overlooked. That could contribute to her feeling that these interactions are a red flag.\n\nThe author's current feelings of hyper-awareness and fear about the friendship are valid, but the key is whether their actions were wrong. The main points are not informing the girlfriend about the sleepover and not being attentive to her concerns about Annie's behavior. The girlfriend's reaction might seem proportional if she feels her boundaries are being respected. Trust is important in relationships, and not involving the partner in decisions that could affect their comfort might be seen as a mistake.\n\nSo, while the author didn't do anything intentionally wrong, the lack of communication and awareness of the girlfriend's feelings could make them at fault. Answer A would be yes if the situation required more consideration and dialogue. Answer B would be no if the actions were innocent. But given the girlfriend's perspective and the context of their past discussions, the author might have a responsibility to be more mindful. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A.\n"
