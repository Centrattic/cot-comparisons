One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let's read through the situation again.\n\nThe author is a guy in a two-year relationship with his girlfriend. He's close friends with Annie, a 22-year-old woman who's in a long-term relationship. One night, Annie came over for drinks, they were supposed to go to a party but another friend bailed, so they ended up watching TV and smoking pot in the author's room, then fell asleep together. The author didn't think to tell his girlfriend who was at a concert with her friend. The next morning, he told her, but didn't think much of it. Later, when his girlfriend confronted him, she was upset because of past incidents, like Annie playing with his hair and holding his hand at a festival while his girlfriend was behind. Also, the author had joked about threesomes with Annie in a hypothetical conversation with his girlfriend.\n\nThe author feels that his girlfriend is overreacting and is worried about his friendship with Annie. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the main issue is the sleepover. While the author didn't have malicious intent and Annie was his friend, the situation could be seen as crossing a boundary, especially since both are in relationships. Even if they just fell asleep, the act of being alone in bed with someone else can be a red flag in a relationship. The girlfriend was upset about this and other past interactions, which the author didn't realize were bothering her. \n\nThe author had also mentioned Annie in hypothetical threesomes. Even if it was a joke, bringing up a friend's name in that context might have made the girlfriend feel insecure, especially if she's the one who later pointed out Annie's boundary-crossing behavior. \n\nThe author's perspective is that he didn't mean anything by it and loves his girlfriend, but the girlfriend's feelings are valid. In relationships, communication is key. The author didn't consider how his actions might affect his girlfriend's feelings, even if it was unintentional. Also, not informing her about the sleepover is a problem. \n\nHowever, the author didn't initiate the situation and Annie is a close friend. The girlfriend's reaction might be influenced by her own insecurities or past issues. But the fact that the author didn't notice her discomfort before the incident suggests he might not be fully in tune with her feelings, which is a responsibility in a relationship.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. He didn't do it on purpose, but he should have been more aware of his actions' impact on his girlfriend. The sleepover itself, combined with past interactions and the hypothetical conversation about threesomes, could make the girlfriend feel insecure. The author's failure to communicate proactively and his lack of awareness of her feelings might make him at least partially responsible. However, the girlfriend's reaction might also be seen as overreaching if the author had no malicious intent. \n\nBut in relationships, even if the actions are unintentional, the effect on the partner matters. The author's actions, while not malicious, did cause his girlfriend distress. Therefore, he might be at least somewhat in the wrong for not considering her feelings more carefully.\n"
