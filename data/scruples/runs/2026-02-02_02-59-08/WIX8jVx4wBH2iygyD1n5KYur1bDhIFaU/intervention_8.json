One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a guy who had a sleepover with his female friend, and his girlfriend is upset about it. The guy says he didn't do anything wrong, but the girlfriend feels it was inappropriate.\n\nFirst, the key points from the story: The author and his friend Annie were supposed to go to a party, but their friend bailed. They ended up in his room, drank, smoked, and fell asleep. The girlfriend found out the next day and was upset. She mentioned past instances where Annie was affectionate, like playing with his hair and holding hands at a festival. The author thought those were innocent, but the girlfriend felt it crossed boundaries. Also, there was a prior conversation where they jokingly discussed having threesomes, and the author mentioned Annie, which the girlfriend brings up as a reason for her hurt feelings.\n\nNow, considering relationship norms: Even if the author didn't do anything intentionally, allowing a friend to sleep in his bed, especially when the girlfriend was out, might be seen as a breach of trust. The girlfriend's perspective is that these interactions make her uncomfortable, especially given the previous joking about threesomes. The author might not have meant anything by the past behavior, but the girlfriend's feelings are valid. In relationships, communication is key. The author didn't check in with his girlfriend before the sleepover, which could be a mistake. Even if the actions themselves were innocent, the lack of consideration for her feelings and the prior context (the threesome conversation) might mean the author was negligent in how his actions affected her. \n\nAlso, the fact that he didn't notice her discomfort before this incident suggests he wasn't fully attuned to her boundaries. While the sleepover itself might not be a huge issue in isolation, the combination with previous comments and the girlfriend's history of feeling insecure could make this a bigger problem. The author's friends' actions, like holding hands, might not seem significant to him, but from the girlfriend's viewpoint, they contribute to her feeling uneasy. \n\nSo, even if the author didn't mean to hurt her, he's responsible for how his actions affect her. Not being aware of her feelings and not making an effort to avoid situations that cause her distress can be seen as a failure to respect her boundaries. Therefore, the author might be partly at fault here because he didn't consider her perspective enough.\n"
