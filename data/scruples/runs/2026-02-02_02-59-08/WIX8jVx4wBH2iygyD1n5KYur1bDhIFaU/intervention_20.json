One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author did something wrong by having a sleepover with a female friend and not informing his girlfriend. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author's friend, Annie, came over to drink, ended up falling asleep in his bed. The girlfriend found out later and was upset. She mentioned past instances where Annie was physically affectionate when the girlfriend wasn't around. Also, there was a prior conversation where the author joked about wanting to have a threesome with Annie.\n\nNow, considering the girlfriend's perspective. She's in a two-year relationship, so trust and communication are important. The author didn't inform her about the sleepover, which might make her feel left out or not respected. Even if it was a casual sleepover, not asking could be seen as a breach of trust. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because she's pointing out that the author didn't notice her discomfort in past interactions with Annie. \n\nThe author might argue that he didn't do anything wrong, but the key here is communication. In relationships, what people think is okay might differ. The fact that the author had previously mentioned wanting to have a threesome with Annie in a joking way could have planted seeds of insecurity. The girlfriend's feelings are legitimate, and the author's lack of awareness about how his actions affected her is a problem. \n\nAlso, the author is now hyper-aware of his actions around Annie, fearing it'll affect their friendship. But maybe that's because the girlfriend's concerns are valid and he needs to adjust his behavior to maintain both the relationship and the friendship. \n\nSo, while the author didn't intentionally do anything wrong, the lack of communication and not considering the girlfriend's feelings beforehand might put him at fault. The answer is A.\n"
