One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe author, who's in a two-year relationship, had a female friend (Annie) over for drinks before a party. They ended up watching TV in his room, smoked some marijuana, and fell asleep together. The girlfriend was at a concert with a friend and didn't come over. The next day, he told her, but didn't think much of it. Later, the girlfriend confronts him about it seriously, bringing up past incidents where Annie seemed to cross boundaries, like playing with his hair and holding his hand when the girlfriend was nearby. She also mentions a previous joking conversation about threesomes where the author mentioned Annie. Now, the author feels like the girlfriend overreacted and is worried about his friendship with Annie.\n\nFirst, I should consider the girlfriend's perspective. She's in a committed relationship, so she might feel jealous or insecure when her partner has someone else in their bed, even if it was accidental. The fact that they had discussed threesomes jokingly but mentioned Annie specifically could be a trigger for her. Even if the author didn't intend anything, not being aware of her feelings and the potential for misunderstanding might be an issue.\n\nFrom the author's side, he didn't initiate anything and thought it was a normal situation. However, having a friend sleep in the same bed, especially when the girlfriend wasn't there, could be seen as crossing a boundary. The past incidents with Annie also add to the girlfriend's concerns. The author didn't notice her discomfort before, which might indicate a lack of communication or sensitivity in the relationship.\n\nThe key points here are boundaries in relationships, communication, and mutual respect. Even if the author didn't mean to do anything wrong, the girlfriend's feelings are valid. The mention of the threesome joke could have planted a seed of doubt, even if it was just a joke. The author might be at fault for not considering how his actions could be perceived, especially with the history mentioned. However, the girlfriend might be overreacting if there was no intention to violate trust. \n\nBut relationships require both parties to be aware of each other's boundaries. The author not realizing that Annie's actions bothered the girlfriend before suggests a lack of attention. The girlfriend's reaction is about her feelings and the cumulative effect of past behaviors and the recent incident. So, maybe the author is partially at fault for not being more considerate, even if unintentionally. On the other hand, the girlfriend's reaction might be disproportionate if there was no malicious intent. But in relationships, intentions don't always matter as much as perceptions and feelings. \n\nI think the author is somewhat in the wrong because he didn't consider his girlfriend's potential discomfort with Annie in the situation, especially given their past. Even if it was accidental, the lack of awareness about her feelings could be a problem. So, maybe the answer is A (Yes).\n"
