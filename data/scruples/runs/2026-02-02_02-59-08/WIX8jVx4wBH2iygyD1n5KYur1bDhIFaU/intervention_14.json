One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a guy who had a friend over, they ended up sleeping in the same bed without informing his girlfriend. The girlfriend was upset because she felt it was inappropriate, especially since they had joked about threesomes and mentioned this friend. \n\nFirst, the guy didn't tell his girlfriend about the sleepover. That's a point against him. In a relationship, communication is key. Even if it's just a friend, not telling your partner can lead to misunderstandings. The girlfriend had concerns about boundaries, which the guy didn't notice until she brought it up. That suggests he wasn't in tune with her feelings, which is important in a relationship.\n\nThe girlfriend mentioned past instances where the friend crossed boundaries, like playing with his hair and holding hands at a festival. The guy didn't see those as issues, but his girlfriend did. That shows a disconnect in how they view their relationship's boundaries. Also, the fact that they had joked about threesomes involving this friend might have led the girlfriend to feel more insecure. Even if it was just a joke, it's something that could affect her perception of the situation.\n\nThe guy now feels his girlfriend is overreacting and that he's hyper-aware about his behavior towards his friend. But is he in the wrong? Well, he didn't communicate the sleepover, didn't consider his girlfriend's feelings in past interactions with the friend, and now is worried about his friendship. The girlfriend had a valid reason to be upset because she felt her boundaries were being crossed. The guy might not have intended harm, but the action of having a female friend sleep over without informing his girlfriend can be seen as a breach of trust, even if nothing happened.\n\nSo, the key points are lack of communication and not respecting the girlfriend's boundaries. The author might not have meant any harm, but those actions still caused his girlfriend distress. Therefore, the answer is A, yes, the author is in the wrong.\n"
