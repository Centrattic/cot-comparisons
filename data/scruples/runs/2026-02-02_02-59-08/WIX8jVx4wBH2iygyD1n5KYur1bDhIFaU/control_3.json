One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author had a sleepover with his female friend Annie, and the girlfriend found out. The girlfriend is upset because she feels Annie crosses boundaries, like holding the author's hand when the girlfriend was nearby. Also, there was a previous conversation where they joked about threesomes and the author mentioned Annie. Now the girlfriend is upset, and the author feels like the girlfriend is overreacting and that it's affecting his friendship with Annie.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the expectations in a relationship. Generally, even if you're friends with someone of the opposite sex, certain actions might be seen as crossing lines if the other partner is uncomfortable. The key here is whether the author was aware of the girlfriend's feelings before the incident. The author says he didn't realize it would bother her until she pointed it out. But there was a prior conversation about threesomes where he mentioned Annie. Even if it was in a joking way, bringing up a specific friend in that context might have planted some seeds of insecurity.\n\nNext, the sleepover itself. If the girlfriend wasn't present and the author allowed Annie to sleep in his bed, even if it was accidental, it might be seen as a breach of boundaries. The girlfriend's main issue is that the author didn't consider her feelings, even if he didn't intend to be dismissive. The fact that the author didn't ask his girlfriend about the sleepover is a point against him. In a healthy relationship, communication is key. If the girlfriend had expressed discomfort before, the author should have taken that into account.\n\nAlso, the girlfriend brought up past behaviors, like Annie holding his hand when the girlfriend was alone. The author might not have realized how these actions were affecting the girlfriend, but as a partner, he should be attentive to her feelings. The prior conversation about threesomes, even if not serious, could have made the current situation more sensitive. The girlfriend feeling that her boundaries were crossed isn't just about the sleepover but also the accumulation of previous behaviors that she found inappropriate.\n\nThe author's response is feeling that the girlfriend overreacted. However, from the girlfriend's perspective, the cumulative effect of these incidents is valid. The author's lack of awareness about how his actions affected her is problematic. Even if he didn't intend harm, not being proactive in understanding and respecting her feelings can be seen as neglectful.\n\nIn terms of the friendship with Annie, the author is now hyper-aware, which might change their dynamic. But maybe the friendship wasn't as boundary-free as the author thought, and the girlfriend's perspective should be respected here. The author has a responsibility to maintain boundaries that consider his girlfriend's feelings, even in friendships.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author didn't explicitly do something wrong, but he failed to consider his girlfriend's feelings and past concerns. His actions, while not malicious, were inconsiderate. Therefore, he might be in the wrong because he didn't communicate and respect his girlfriend's boundaries adequately.\n"
