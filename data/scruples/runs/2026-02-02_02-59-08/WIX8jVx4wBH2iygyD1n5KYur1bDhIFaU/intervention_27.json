One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a guy who had a sleepover with his female friend Annie, who is in a long-term relationship, and didn't inform his girlfriend. The girlfriend was upset, partly because of a past conversation where they jokingly discussed threesomes and the author mentioned Annie. Now the guy is wondering if he's in the wrong for feeling the situation was blown out of proportion and if it's affecting his friendship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the girlfriend's perspective. She's in a relationship and her partner had a sleepover with another girl in his bed. Even if they just fell asleep after hanging out, not having sex, it can still be a trust issue. The girlfriend mentioned that Annie had previously crossed boundaries, like playing with his hair and holding his hand while she was nearby. The author didn't notice these things, which shows he might not be aware of how his actions affect her. \n\nThen there's the part about the threesome conversation. Even if it was in jest, bringing up a friend in such a context might make the girlfriend uneasy, especially if that friend is in a relationship. It's a red flag for her because it could imply that the author is considering that friend as a potential romantic partner or is open to the idea, which she might find disrespectful. \n\nThe author didn't ask his girlfriend about the sleepover. Communication is key in relationships, and keeping her out of the loop, especially for something that involves friends in a way that could be misinterpreted, is a problem. Even if the intention was innocent, the lack of communication led to her feeling hurt and overlooked. \n\nAlso, after the fact, the author is now hyper-aware of his behavior around Annie, but the girlfriend might feel that the damage is done because of the prior conversation about threesomes. The author's actions, combined with that past joke, likely made her feel insecure and untrusted. \n\nSo, while the author might not have done anything intentionally wrong, the situation is about how his actions made his girlfriend feel. In relationships, intention vs. perception can matter a lot. The girlfriend's concerns are valid because she felt her boundaries were crossed, even if the author didn't mean to. The author should have been more communicative and considerate of her feelings, especially given their previous discussions. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong because he didn't communicate properly and his past joke contributed to the girlfriend's insecurity, even if the sleepover itself was innocent.\n"
