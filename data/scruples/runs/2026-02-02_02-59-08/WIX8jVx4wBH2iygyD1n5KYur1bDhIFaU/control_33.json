One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. Let me start by understanding the key points.\n\nFirst, the author had a sleepover with a female friend, Annie, in his room. They both fell asleep after drinking and smoking. The girlfriend found out later and was upset, especially because they had previously joked about threesomes and the author had mentioned Annie. The girlfriend felt that even though the author didn't intentionally do anything wrong, he was unaware of how his actions affected her. Now, the author feels the girlfriend overreacted and is worried about his friendship with Annie.\n\nSo, the main issues here are consent in the relationship, communication, and boundaries. The author didn't ask his girlfriend, but he didn't intend to hurt her either. However, the girlfriend's reaction is rooted in feeling that the boundaries were crossed. In relationships, communication is key. Even if the act itself was innocent, not informing the girlfriend could be seen as a breach of trust, especially since they had discussed such scenarios before. The mention of Annie in the context of threesomes adds another layer, as it might have made the girlfriend feel that the author's choice of friend was insensitive.\n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't have malicious intent and hadn't initiated any of the past boundary-crossing behaviors. The girlfriend acknowledged he didn't do anything wrong but felt neglected. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not considering how his actions affected her. \n\nIn relationship advice, partners are often encouraged to discuss boundaries and communicate openly. The author's lack of awareness here might be a failure in communication rather than a malicious act. However, since the girlfriend is his partner and their relationship dynamics include discussing such things, the author could be at fault for not being more considerate of her feelings, even if unintentionally.\n\nSo, considering both perspectives, the answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong, but there's a responsibility to communicate and respect the girlfriend's feelings moving forward. However, the girlfriend's reaction, while valid, might be seen as overblown if the actions were indeed innocent. But since the context includes prior discussions about threesomes involving Annie, it's possible the author's actions triggered deeper insecurities. \n\nI think the key here is that the author isn't in the wrong in terms of intent, but maybe in the lack of communication. However, the question is whether he is in the wrong, not whether the girlfriend is right. Since he didn't act with malice and the girlfriend admitted he didn't do anything wrong, the answer might be B (No). But if the situation inherently breached relationship boundaries that he should have been aware of, then A (Yes). \n\nBut given that the girlfriend acknowledged he didn't do anything wrong and the main issue was his lack of awareness, maybe it's a B. However, the fact that he had previously mentioned Annie in the context of threesomes might have set expectations that he didn't consider. So maybe he is in the wrong for not being aware of how that would affect her. Hmm. This is tricky. I think the answer is B because the author didn't act with intent, and the girlfriend's reaction is based on her feelings. But some might argue that he should have been more considerate. The community often sides on the side of communication and awareness, so maybe A? Wait, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. If the girlfriend's feelings are valid, then the author's failure to consider them could be seen as wrong. But if the actions were innocent, maybe not. I'm a bit split here. In AITA scenarios, the focus is on intent. If there's no intent, then it's a B. But if the author should have known better, maybe A. The fact that they had discussed threesomes with Annie might make it more about the girlfriend's valid insecurities. So, the author's actions, while innocent, might still be inconsiderate. So answer A.\n"
