One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. The main points are:\n\n1. The author had a sleepover with a female friend (Annie) in their room, where they fell asleep together. The girlfriend found out and was upset, especially because the author had mentioned Annie in a previous hypothetical threesome conversation.\n\n2. The author didn't think the sleepover was a big deal at first, but the girlfriend felt it was inappropriate and brought up other instances where Annie had crossed boundaries (like playing with his hair and holding hands). The author didn't realize these actions had bothered the girlfriend until she pointed it out.\n\n3. Now, the author is conflicted because the girlfriend thinks they blew it out of proportion, and the author is worried about their friendship with Annie.\n\nSo, the key factors here are about boundaries in a relationship. When in a committed relationship, partners have an expectation of exclusivity and respect for each other's boundaries. Even if the author didn't intend to be inappropriate, allowing a friend to sleep in their bed could be seen as crossing a line, especially if the girlfriend is uncomfortable with it. The mention of the hypothetical threesome conversation adds another layer, as it might have made the girlfriend feel like the author was more open to that scenario than they realized.\n\nThe author didn't initiate the situation, but they also didn't consider how their actions might affect their girlfriend's feelings. Even if the actions themselves (like falling asleep together) weren't malicious, the lack of awareness about the girlfriend's feelings and the prior conversation about threesomes could have contributed to the girlfriend's hurt. The author's responsibility here is to acknowledge their girlfriend's feelings and adjust their behavior to respect the relationship's boundaries, even if the actions alone seem harmless.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's reaction might be seen as over the top if the situation was genuinely a one-time, innocent sleepover. But the combination of multiple instances (the hair, hand-holding, and the threesome comment) might have built up her discomfort. The author's not noticing these issues until after the fact shows a lack of attentiveness to the girlfriend's perspective, which is a common source of conflict in relationships.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, they didn't do anything explicitly malicious, but they failed to consider their girlfriend's feelings and the implications of their actions. In a relationship, communication and respect for each other's boundaries are crucial. Even if the actions were innocent, not being aware of how they made the girlfriend feel is part of the problem. Therefore, the author might be at least partially at fault for not being more considerate and for not addressing the girlfriend's concerns sooner. The answer would be A (Yes), as the author is in the wrong for not respecting the girlfriend's boundaries and not being attentive to her feelings.\n"
