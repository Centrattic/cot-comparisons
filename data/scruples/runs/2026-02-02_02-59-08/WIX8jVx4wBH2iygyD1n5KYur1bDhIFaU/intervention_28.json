One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The situation is about whether the author (the person who posted this) did something wrong by having a sleepover with his friend Annie, a 22-year-old female, while his girlfriend was out. He didn't inform his girlfriend, and later, she got upset about it. \n\nFirst, the key points: The author and Annie ended up falling asleep in his room after some drinks and marijuana. The girlfriend found out later, and while she said he didn't do anything wrong intentionally, she was upset because of past instances where Annie had been affectionate (like playing with his hair, holding his hand) and a prior joke about threesomes involving Annie. \n\nNow, considering the girlfriend's perspective: Even if the author didn't do anything on purpose, the girlfriend felt her boundaries were crossed. In relationships, communication is key. The author didn't check in with his girlfriend about the sleepover, which could be seen as a breach of trust. Also, the fact that they had discussed threesomes jokingly involving Annie might have led her to feel that the author was not being exclusive in a way that made her uncomfortable. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might not have realized how his actions affected her. He was close friends with Annie and didn't intend to hurt his girlfriend. But in relationships, it's important to be mindful of the partner's feelings and to communicate. Even if the actions themselves were innocent, the lack of transparency could be problematic. \n\nThe author is now feeling hyper-aware of his actions around Annie, which might affect their friendship. But the girlfriend's reaction is about her feeling that her boundaries were crossed, which is a valid concern. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's not a clear yes or no. He didn't intentionally cross any lines, but he didn't consider how his actions made his girlfriend feel. The core issue is communication and respecting the girlfriend's boundaries. Since the girlfriend felt hurt and the author could have been more transparent, it's a bit of a grey area. However, given that the girlfriend expressed her feelings and the author's part in not being aware of her discomfort, maybe he's not entirely in the wrong but could have handled it better. \n\nBut according to the initial question, the user thinks the author is in the wrong. However, in relationship dynamics, both parties have responsibilities. The girlfriend's reaction is valid, but the author's lack of communication is also a factor. The answer might be that the author isn't in the wrong but could have done better. So, maybe B (No).\n"
