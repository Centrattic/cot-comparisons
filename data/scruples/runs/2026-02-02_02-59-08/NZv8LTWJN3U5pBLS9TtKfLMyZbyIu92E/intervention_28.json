We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling her mother and husband to \"fuck off\" after they criticized her daughter in front of her. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The daughter was moving back in after a tough breakup and has been struggling with depression. She's made progress, getting a job, going back to school, and therapy. The husband is annoyed by her messiness, and the mother agrees with him. They discussed this in front of the daughter, then criticized her about the cat's litter. The daughter was upset, and the author snapped, telling them to fuck off.\n\nThe author's perspective is that she's protecting her daughter's mental health. The husband didn't apologize, and the mother and husband kept berating the daughter. The author took the daughter out to calm down.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know my take. \n\nOn one hand, the author used harsh language, which is unprofessional and could be seen as disrespectful. However, the situation was emotionally charged. The daughter was already vulnerable, and the parents' behavior might have triggered a setback. The author's primary concern was her daughter's well-being, which is valid. \n\nBut using such a strong response might have been an overreaction, even if the situation was bad. The husband and mother might not have realized the impact of their words, but the author's choice of language could have escalated things. However, given the daughter's mental health history, the author's action might be seen as necessary to stop further harm.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a tough call. The right to protect a child's mental health is important, but the method of response could be questioned. Maybe there's a middle ground, like calmly addressing the issue instead of yelling. But in the heat of the moment, emotions can take over. \n\nI think the key points are the intent (protecting the daughter) versus the method (harsh language). The answer might depend on cultural context or personal values. If we prioritize the daughter's mental health, the author's action is justified. If we focus on the use of language and the approach, she might be in the wrong. \n\nBut considering the daughter's potential deterioration if not protected, the author's reaction, while strong, was a response to a harmful situation. Therefore, the author might not be in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
