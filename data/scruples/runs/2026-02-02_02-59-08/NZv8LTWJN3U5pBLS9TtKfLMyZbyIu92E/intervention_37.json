We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves the author yelling at her mother and husband after they criticized her daughter in front of her. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The daughter has been through a tough time with depression and has made significant progress. She's working, going to school, and in therapy. The issue here is her messiness, which the husband and mother criticized in front of her. The daughter was clearly upset, crying, and feeling like a \"piece of shit.\" The author lost her temper, told her mother and husband to fuck off, and hasn't spoken to them since. She's conflicted because she feels bad but is also worried about her daughter's mental health.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics. The daughter is in a vulnerable state, having just recovered from depression. Public criticism from family members, especially in front of each other, can be really damaging. The mother and husband's actions might have been unkind and not supportive. The author's reaction was a direct response to protect her daughter from further harm. \n\nOn the other hand, using strong language like \"fuck off\" is aggressive and could be seen as inappropriate, regardless of the situation. However, the author's motivation was to defend her daughter's feelings and mental health. The question is whether the means justified the ends. \n\nIn terms of social norms, while being disrespectful is usually frowned upon, the context of protecting a vulnerable family member might be seen as a justifiable reason. The author might not be in the wrong because the intent was to shield her daughter from emotional harm, even if the method was harsh. The mother and husband also have some responsibility for not being considerate of the daughter's mental state when bringing up the criticism in front of her.\n\nSo, weighing the emotional harm caused by the mother and husband's actions versus the author's outburst. The author's action, though harsh, was in defense of her daughter. Therefore, the answer might lean towards B (the author is not in the wrong). But I need to be careful. The use of profanity is a red flag, but the context is crucial here. The daughter's well-being is a significant factor. The author's frustration and fear for her daughter's mental health likely outweigh the impropriety of her language. Hence, the answer is B.\n"
