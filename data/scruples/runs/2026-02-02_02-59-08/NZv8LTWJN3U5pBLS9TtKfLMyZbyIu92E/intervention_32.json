We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for yelling at her mother and husband after they criticized her daughter in front of her.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The daughter has a history of depression and is making progress. The husband and mother were criticizing her for being messy and not taking care of the cat, which they did in front of the daughter. The daughter was upset and started crying, repeating she's a piece of shit. The author lost her temper and told them to be respectful or leave.\n\nSo, the key points: the daughter is vulnerable, the parents and in-laws were being harsh in public, causing emotional distress. The author intervened to protect her daughter. \n\nOn one hand, yelling and using a strong language like \"fuck off\" could be seen as inappropriate, especially in family dynamics. But on the other hand, the situation was emotionally charged, and the daughter's mental health is a concern. The author acted to defend her daughter against public shaming, which could exacerbate her depression.\n\nThe husband didn't apologize, and the mother continued after returning. The author's reaction might be a justified reaction to protect her daughter's mental health. However, the method used could be questioned. But the intent was to stop the bullying. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's a gray area. But considering the daughter's well-being and the fact that the parents were being unkind publicly, maybe the author isn't entirely in the wrong. However, the way she reacted might not be the best approach. But given the circumstances, her actions were protective. \n\nI think the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the intent was to protect her daughter's mental health from harmful criticism. The method is harsh, but the motivation is protective. However, some might argue that the author overreacted. But given the daughter's state, it's understandable. So leaning towards B.\n"
