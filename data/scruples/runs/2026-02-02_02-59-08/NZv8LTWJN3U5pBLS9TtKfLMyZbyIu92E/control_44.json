We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. Let me go through the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the setup: The author's daughter moved in after a tough breakup and has been working on her mental health, getting a job, going to school, and therapy. That's a lot of progress. The husband has a problem with her being messy, which the author thinks is because of her past depression. The author is more understanding, given the daughter's current stress.\n\nThen, the mother visits and they discuss the daughter's messiness in front of her. The husband vents, the mother agrees, they criticize the daughter's cat care. The daughter is upset, tells her dad he hurt her feelings. The husband doesn't apologize. The author consoles the daughter, but the mother and husband keep berating her. The author loses it, tells them to either be respectful or \"fuck off,\" and takes the daughter out. Now there's a rift with her husband and mother.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the daughter is in a vulnerable state, recovering from depression. Public criticism from family might trigger a relapse. The parents (husband and mother) are being harsh in front of her, not respecting the author's wishes to be supportive. The author's outburst was in defense of the daughter's mental health.\n\nIs the author wrong? Well, the parents were being inconsiderate. The daughter's mental health is a priority. The author's response, while strong, was a reaction to protect their child. However, the language used (\"fuck off\") could be seen as harsh. But given the context\u2014protecting a vulnerable daughter from public shaming\u2014maybe it's understandable. The author also took action to comfort the daughter, so their intention was to help.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband and mother might feel their concerns are valid. However, discussing such issues in front of the daughter and being unapologetic about it is problematic. The author's response, while not the most diplomatic, was a stand for the daughter's emotional well-being. So, probably not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
