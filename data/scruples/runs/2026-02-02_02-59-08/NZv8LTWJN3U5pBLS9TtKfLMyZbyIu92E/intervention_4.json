We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The scenario involves the mother, husband, and daughter. The daughter, who has been overcoming depression, is criticized in front of her by her father and mother-in-law. The author, the mother, loses her temper and tells them to \"fuck off.\"\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The daughter has made significant progress after a tough time, but her messiness is being criticized. The husband and mother-in-law are publicly berating her, which is likely hurtful. The daughter is already vulnerable due to her mental health history. The mother steps in to defend her daughter, which is a natural parental instinct. However, the method she used\u2014yelling and using harsh language\u2014might be seen as extreme.\n\nOn one hand, public shaming and criticism can be damaging, especially for someone with a history of depression. Standing up for her daughter in that moment could be seen as protecting her mental health. On the other hand, using strong language like \"fuck off\" might escalate the situation and could be considered disrespectful to her husband and mother.\n\nThe key points are: the daughter's mental state, the public criticism from family members, and the mother's reaction. The mother's intention was to protect her daughter from further emotional harm, which is understandable. However, the approach might be seen as overreacting. But considering the daughter's fragility, maybe the mother's reaction is justified as a necessary defense.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The mother's actions were driven by concern for her daughter, but the method could be questioned. However, given the context of the daughter's mental health and the inconsiderate behavior of the husband and mother-in-law, the mother's outburst might be seen as a justified response to protect her child.\n"
