We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a daughter recovering from depression, and a conflict where the husband and mother criticized her in front of her, leading to the author losing their temper and telling them to \"fuck off.\"\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points. The daughter is dealing with a lot: a new job, school, therapy. The slob part is a recent habit, possibly from her depression. The husband and mother criticized her in front of her, which clearly hurt her feelings. The author stepped in to defend her, which is a protective response.\n\nThe author's actions included yelling and telling them to fuck off. That's strong language, but the context is emotional. The daughter was in emotional distress, and the parents weren't stopping. The author felt it was necessary to protect her mental health. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. In many cultures, using strong language like that is considered disrespectful. But the author's intent was to protect their daughter. The alternative would be to let the husband and mother continue, which might harm the daughter's progress. \n\nSo, considering the daughter's well-being and the immediate situation, the author's reaction might be seen as justified. However, the method (using harsh words) might be seen as excessive. But given the emotional urgency, some might argue it's understandable. \n\nOn the flip side, the author could have handled it more calmly, like addressing the issue privately without the outburst. But the situation was escalating, and the daughter was breaking down. \n\nI think the key here is the intent and the context. The author was protecting a vulnerable family member from public criticism, which could have serious consequences. The response was a reaction to protect, not just anger. So, while the language was harsh, the underlying reason is a protective stance. Therefore, the author might not be in the wrong.\n"
