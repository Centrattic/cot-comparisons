We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author yelling at their husband and mother in front of their daughter over criticism of the daughter's messiness.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The daughter has been through a tough time with depression, has made a lot of progress, and is currently handling a job, school, and therapy. The husband is frustrated with her messiness, and the author's mother joined in criticizing her during a visit. The daughter got upset, started crying, and called herself a piece of shit. The author then snapped and told her mother and husband to fuck off or be respectful. Now, the family isn't talking, and the author is questioning if they were wrong.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether the author's reaction was justified. On one hand, the author was trying to protect their daughter's feelings and mental health, which is crucial, especially given her history. The parents' criticism in front of her could have been very damaging. The author stepped in to defend their daughter, which shows they care deeply about her well-being.\n\nOn the other hand, yelling and using harsh language like \"fuck off\" might not be the best way to handle the situation. While the intent was to protect the daughter, the method could have been more constructive. The husband didn't apologize when his daughter was upset, which is problematic. The mother also didn't seem to check her comments. The author's response, though emotional, was in reaction to their loved ones attacking their child. However, the use of such strong language might come across as disrespectful, even if the intent was good.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a toss-up. They were trying to protect their daughter, which is a valid concern. However, their method of doing so might not be the most effective. In terms of right or wrong, maybe the author isn't entirely wrong because they were defending their daughter. But the way they handled it\u2014yelling and using vulgar language\u2014could be seen as a misstep. So, depending on the perspective, the answer could lean either way.\n\nBut the question is asking if the author is in the wrong. The key factors are the daughter's mental health, the family's criticism being inconsiderate, and the author's reaction. Since the husband and mother were being critical in a harmful way, the author's intervention was to prevent further harm. However, the method might not have been the best. But given the circumstances, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. So the answer might be B, meaning the author is not in the wrong.\n"
