We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author yelling at their mother and husband for berating their daughter in front of her.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The daughter is 26, has a history of depression, and is currently doing well with a job, school, and therapy. The husband and mother criticize her for being messy, specifically about the cat's litter box, in front of her. The daughter is upset, and the author loses her temper, telling them to either be respectful or \"fuck off.\" The author then takes the daughter to get food and calm down, and they haven't spoken to each other since.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether the author's reaction was justified. On one hand, the parents and mother-in-law were being unkind in front of the daughter, which could harm her mental health. The author is trying to protect her daughter, which is a valid concern. On the other hand, yelling and using harsh language might be seen as over the top, even if the intention was good.\n\nThe husband didn't apologize when the daughter was upset, which is a problem. The mother-in-law also continued the criticism. The daughter's mental health is at stake, so protecting her is important. The author's action could be seen as standing up for their child. However, the method\u2014using a swear word and cutting off communication\u2014might be seen as extreme. But in the context of defending their child from public shaming, maybe it's understandable.\n\nI think the key factors are: the daughter's mental health, the public criticism by family members, and the author's response to protect her. While the method was harsh, the intent was protective. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong. But some might argue that the tone was inappropriate. However, given the circumstances, it's a tough call. I'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because the primary goal was to protect their daughter from emotional harm.\n"
