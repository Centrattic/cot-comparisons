We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author is a person caught in a family conflict involving their daughter, husband, and mother. The situation revolves around the daughter's messiness and the reactions of other family members. The key points here are the public shaming of the daughter by her father and mother, which led to the daughter feeling deeply hurt and even saying she's a \"piece of shit.\" The author steps in and tells her husband and mother off, leading to a fallout where they haven't spoken since.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the actions of each party. The husband and mother publicly criticized the daughter in front of her, which is a significant issue. Public shaming, especially in the context of someone with a history of depression, can be extremely harmful. The daughter was already under a lot of pressure with her job, school, and therapy. The parents' comments about the cat's litter box and her general messiness were in a public setting, which adds to the humiliation factor. The husband didn't apologize when the daughter was upset, which shows a lack of empathy and support. The mother continued the criticism after returning from outside, so she's also complicit.\n\nNow, the author's reaction was to yell at both husband and mother, telling them to be respectful or \"fuck off.\" While the language is strong, the context is that they were defending their daughter from public humiliation. The author's intention was to protect the daughter's mental health, which is a valid concern given the daughter's history of depression. The author took the daughter out to calm down, which is a responsible action to prevent further emotional harm.\n\nThe question is whether the author was wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). The author's outburst was in response to a harmful situation. While the language used is harsh, the underlying motivation was protective. Public shaming by family members is a serious issue, and the author's intervention aimed to stop the immediate harm. However, the author could have handled the situation differently, perhaps by addressing the husband and mother privately without the strong language. But given the emotional stakes and the daughter's mental health, the intervention might be seen as justified.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's reaction caused a rift in the family, and they haven't made efforts to reconcile. This could lead to long-term issues. But the initial problem was the public shaming, which is more about the husband and mother's actions. The author's response was a direct reaction to protect their child, which is a fundamental parental role.\n\nConsidering all factors, the author's actions were a response to protect their daughter from public humiliation and potential relapse in her mental health. While the method was aggressive, the intent was protective. Therefore, the author might not be in the wrong, but the situation is complex. However, according to the user's initial thought that the author is in the wrong, but after analysis, I might lean towards the author not being in the wrong because the intervention was to protect the daughter from harmful public criticism. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
