We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a daughter with depression who's making progress, but her parents and mother-in-law are criticizing her for being messy in front of her, leading to the author losing their temper and telling them to fuck off.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points. The daughter has made significant improvements in her life, including a job, school, and therapy. The husband and mother are publicly criticizing her for her cleanliness, which seems to be a relapse from her depression. The daughter is emotionally vulnerable, and the criticism caused her to feel terrible, even saying she's a piece of shit. The author intervened to protect her, which resulted in yelling at the husband and mother and telling them to fuck off.\n\nNow, considering right and wrong. The husband and mother's actions were clearly hurtful and unkind. They were belittling the daughter in front of her, which is a major issue. The author's reaction was a direct response to protect their daughter's mental health. The daughter's mental state is a concern, and public humiliation could set her back. So, the author's outburst might be seen as a necessary defense.\n\nHowever, the method of defense was aggressive and unprofessional. Using strong language and cutting off communication might have been excessive, but the context is emotional and aimed at protecting a vulnerable person. The question is whether the author's actions were justified given the circumstances.\n\nAlternately, some might argue that the author should have handled it differently, like a private conversation rather than public yelling. But given the daughter's emotional state and the immediate need to stop the hurtful comments, the author might feel that was the only way to intervene quickly.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, the husband and mother are clearly in the wrong for their treatment of the daughter. The author's reaction, while harsh, was a response to protect their child. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong; they were acting to defend their daughter's well-being. The wrong here might lie more with the husband and mother for their behavior towards the daughter.\n"
