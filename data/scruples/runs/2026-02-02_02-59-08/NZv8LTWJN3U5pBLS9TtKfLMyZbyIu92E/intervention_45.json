We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe person, let's say they're the parent (mother), has a daughter who moved in after a tough breakup and was dealing with depression. The daughter has made a lot of progress: job, school, therapy. The mother and husband have a good relationship, and the mother-in-law is involved but has minor issues with the daughter.\n\nThe problem starts when the husband and mother criticize the daughter in front of her about being messy and not taking care of the cat. The daughter gets upset, cries, and the husband doesn't apologize. The mother then continues berating her, leading the person to lose their temper, yell at both of them, tell them to fuck off, and take the daughter out to calm down. Now the mother and husband are upset and haven't spoken to her.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but is curious for another opinion. The answer options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no).\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the situation. The daughter is vulnerable, working on her recovery. Public criticism from family members could be detrimental. The husband didn't apologize when the daughter was upset, which is concerning. The mother and husband's actions might have triggered the daughter's self-esteem issues, leading to the emotional outburst.\n\nThe author's response was to confront them in a harsh way. Yelling and using strong language like \"fuck off\" is aggressive, but it was in defense of their daughter. The key points are: intent, context, and proportionality. The author's intent was to protect their daughter's mental health, which is valid. However, the method used was confrontational and could be seen as disrespectful to the mother and husband. \n\nBut considering the daughter's mental state, the mother might feel it's necessary to protect her from further harm. The mother and husband's public criticism was inappropriate, especially given the daughter's history. The author's reaction, while unorthodox, might be justified as a protective measure. However, using such strong language could strain family relationships and might be seen as the mother overstepping.\n\nIn AITA discussions, the community often considers the balance between defending a loved one and the method used. If the criticism was unwarranted and public, the mother's defense could be seen as reasonable. However, the harsh language might be seen as crossing a line. It's a tricky call. \n\nI think the mother is not in the wrong because the primary issue was the public criticism of the daughter by her father and grandmother, which could negatively impact her recovery. The mother's outburst was a reaction to protect her child's mental health, even if the method was not ideal. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
