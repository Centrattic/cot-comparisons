We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author yelling at her mother and husband because they criticized their daughter in front of her, leading to the daughter becoming upset.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The daughter has a history of depression and has been working hard to improve her life. The husband and mother criticized her for being messy and not taking care of her cat, which the daughter had been doing. This happened in front of the daughter, causing her to cry. The author intervened, telling her mother and husband to \"fuck off\" or else they'd eat dinner alone. Now, they haven't spoken to her since, and she's wondering if she's the asshole.\n\nThe key points here are the emotional well-being of the daughter, the dynamics within the family, and the appropriateness of the author's response. The daughter is in a vulnerable state, dealing with depression and trying to rebuild her life. Public criticism from family members could be harmful, especially if it exacerbates her mental health issues. The author's intervention was a reaction to protect her daughter's feelings, even if the method was harsh.\n\nOn one hand, yelling and using strong language like \"fuck off\" might be seen as overreacting. However, the context is that the daughter was emotionally distressed, and the other two family members were contributing to that distress. The author's action was immediately after the daughter was crying and feeling like a \"piece of shit.\" The intent was to stop the negative comments and support the daughter.\n\nThe mother and husband were in the wrong for berating the daughter in front of her, which is unkind and potentially damaging. The author's outburst, while harsh, was a direct result of trying to defend her daughter from what she perceived as unjust criticism. The daughter's mental health is a significant factor here; the author might believe that protecting her daughter's self-esteem is more important than maintaining harmony with her mother and husband in the moment.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It depends on the perspective. If we look at the immediate action, using strong language can be seen as rude. But considering the underlying reasons\u2014protecting a vulnerable family member from harmful criticism\u2014the action might be justified. The alternative would be to let the daughter be criticized, which could have longer-term negative effects. The author's outburst was a reaction to protect her daughter, and while the method was extreme, the intent was protective. Therefore, the answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong (B), as the action was motivated by a desire to protect her daughter's mental health, even if the approach was harsh.\n"
