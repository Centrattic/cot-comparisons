We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who posted the \"AITA\" question is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author yelling at her mother and husband after they criticized her daughter in front of her.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the key points. The daughter has been recovering from depression and is doing well in her job, school, and therapy. The issue is her messiness, which the husband and mother discuss in front of her, criticizing her for not taking care of the cat. The author intervened by telling them to be respectful or leave, then left with her daughter.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but is that right? Let's consider the perspective of the author. She's trying to protect her daughter's mental health. The daughter was already vulnerable, and the couple's comments caused her to feel that everyone thinks she's a piece of shit. The author's reaction was to defend her daughter, which is understandable given the context. The husband didn't apologize, and the mother continued, so the author felt it necessary to take a strong stance.\n\nOn the other hand, yelling at family members and telling them to \"fuck off\" is a strong reaction. While the intention was protective, the method might be seen as harsh. However, the context is that the daughter was being attacked, which could justify the urgency. The author's actions were to prevent further harm to her daughter's mental health.\n\nThe husband and mother's behavior is also questionable. Criticizing someone in front of them, especially when they're recovering from depression, is not supportive. So the root issue might be their behavior, not the author's response. The author's outburst was a reaction to protect her daughter, which could be seen as justified given the circumstances.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong for how she handled it? Some might say that there are more constructive ways to address the situation without yelling. However, given the emotional state of the daughter and the immediate need to stop the criticism, her actions might be seen as a necessary intervention. The fact that she hasn't reached out since might be a separate issue, but the initial outburst is the focus here.\n\nConsidering all this, the author's main goal was to protect her daughter's well-being. While the method was extreme, the underlying reason is valid. Therefore, the author might not be in the wrong because she was acting in her daughter's best interest against a harmful situation.\n"
