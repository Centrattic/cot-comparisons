We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves a daughter who's recovering from depression, moving back in with her parents, and now there's a conflict about her being messy. The mother and husband criticized her in front of her, leading the mother to lose her temper and tell them to \"fuck off.\"\n\nFirst, the daughter has a lot on her plate: job, school, therapy. The mother is proud of her progress and has been cutting her some slack. The husband, however, is annoyed by the mess and discussed it with the mother-in-law in front of the daughter. That's probably a mistake because bringing up such a sensitive topic publicly could make the daughter feel humiliated. The mother-in-law tried to console her, but then the mother and father continued berating her after the mother went back in. The mother's response of yelling and telling them to fuck off was a reaction to protect her daughter's mental health.\n\nThe key points here are: the daughter's mental health is fragile, the criticism was public and unkind, and the mother's outburst was in defense. The mother might feel justified because the daughter was already feeling bad about herself. However, using harsh language like \"fuck off\" could be seen as over the top, even if the intent was protective. The question is whether the mother's reaction was appropriate given the context.\n\nOn one hand, the mother and husband were being inconsiderate by discussing the daughter's flaws in front of her, especially when she's in recovery. The mother-in-law's outburst might be a result of frustration at their actions. On the other hand, the author (the mother) did use aggressive language which might not be the best approach, even if the intention was good. It's possible that a more constructive response could have been better for the daughter's well-being in the long run. But considering the daughter's mental state, the mother might have felt that standing up to them was necessary to prevent further harm. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the answer is based on the intent and the daughter's vulnerability, maybe not. But if the focus is on the method (yelling and harsh words), then maybe yes. However, the mother's primary concern was her daughter's mental health, and the others weren't acknowledging that. The husband not apologizing and the mother-in-law agreeing with him might have escalated the situation. The mother's reaction could be seen as a last resort to stop the negative comments. Therefore, while the language was strong, the motivation was to protect her daughter. The answer might be B (No), because the author's action was a response to protect their daughter's mental health from unkind, public criticism.\n"
