We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author's daughter moved in with them after a tough breakup and depression. She's been doing really well, getting a job, going to school, therapy. Then her husband and mother start criticizing her messiness in front of her, even bringing up the cat's litter box. The daughter gets upset, and the author yells at them to stop, telling them to \"fuck off\" or leave.\n\nFirst, I need to see if the author's reaction was justified. The daughter was in a vulnerable state, crying and feeling like a piece of shit. The parents (husband and mother) were berating her in front of her, which is pretty harsh. The author stepped in to protect their daughter, which is a good intention. But the method was yelling and using a strong curse word. \n\nNow, is that the wrong approach? Well, the author did feel that their daughter's mental health is a priority. The husband and mother were contributing to the daughter's distress. The author's action stopped the immediate harm, but maybe the way they did it could have been handled better. However, given the emotional situation, sometimes people act on impulse. \n\nIs the author at fault? On one hand, they did lose their temper, which isn't ideal. On the other hand, they were protecting their child from emotional abuse by their spouse and parent. The key points are intent and proportionality. The intent was to protect the daughter, which is valid. The proportionality is a bit iffy\u2014yelling and using such a strong word might have been excessive, but given the context of the daughter's fragile mental state, maybe it was necessary to stop the attack.\n\nThe husband's behavior is questionable too. He was venting about his daughter's habits in front of her, which isn't respectful. The mother-in-law agreeing and adding to the criticism isn't helping. The author's actions were a reaction to their combined behavior. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If we judge based on intent and the context of protecting a vulnerable family member, maybe not. They took a stand to prevent further harm. However, the method could have been more constructive. But since the question is about being in the wrong, the answer might depend on whether the action was justified by the circumstances. The author's actions were a response to protect, not just to be angry. Therefore, they might not be in the wrong.\n"
