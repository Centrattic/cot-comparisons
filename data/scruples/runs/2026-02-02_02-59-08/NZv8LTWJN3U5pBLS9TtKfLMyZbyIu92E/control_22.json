We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The scenario involves a family conflict where the author yelled at their mother and husband after they criticized their daughter in front of her. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The daughter has a history of depression and has made significant progress. Her parents and mother-in-law were talking about her messiness and her cat in front of her, which hurt her feelings. The husband didn't apologize, and both continued to berate her even after she was upset. The author then lost their temper and told them to fuck off.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether the author's reaction was justified. The daughter's mental health is a big factor. The parents and mother-in-law were contributing to her emotional distress by not being supportive and instead criticizing her. The author stepped in to protect their daughter, which is a natural instinct, especially when they were being unsupportive. \n\nThe question is about right and wrong. The parents' actions were unkind, especially given the daughter's mental health struggles. The author's outburst was in response to that. While yelling isn't ideal, the underlying reason is to protect a vulnerable family member. The author also took action to console their daughter, which shows they were trying to help.\n\nThere's a balance between maintaining family relationships and standing up for someone who's being harmed. The author's actions were in defense of their daughter's well-being. The husband and mother weren't in the wrong for pointing out the messiness, but doing so in a hurtful way in front of her and not apologizing when she was upset was the issue. The author's response, though harsh, was a reaction to protect their child's mental health.\n\nTherefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They were trying to support their daughter during a sensitive time. The answer is B, not in the wrong.\n"
