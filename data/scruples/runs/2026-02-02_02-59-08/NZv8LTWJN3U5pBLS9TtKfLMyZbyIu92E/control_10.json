We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again to make sure I understand all the details.\n\nThe author is a woman who has a loving relationship with her husband and a normal, if not a bit strained, relationship with her mother. Their daughter, who is 26, moved in after a bad breakup and was struggling with depression. She's making progress though\u2014got a job, back in school, therapy, etc. The author is proud. The husband is annoyed because the daughter is a bit messy now, but the author gives her slack considering her situation.\n\nThen the mother visits, and she and the husband start talking about the daughter's messiness in front of her. They mention her cat's litter box, implying she's not taking care of it properly. The daughter is upset, cries, and says she's a \"piece of shit.\" The author consoles her, but the mother and husband continue berating her. The author loses her temper, tells them to be respectful or leave, takes the daughter out, and now there's a rift with both the mother and husband. The author is asking if she's in the wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the daughter is in a sensitive situation after depression, and the husband and mother criticized her in front of her, which caused her emotional distress. The author stepped in to defend her daughter, using strong language, and now there's fallout. The question is whether she's at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The daughter is recovering from depression and working on her life. Public criticism from family members, especially in front of her, could be harmful. The husband and mother chose to discuss her messiness in front of her, which is a problem. The daughter's emotional response is understandable given her history.\n\nThe author's reaction was to defend her daughter. The phrase \"tell them to fuck off\" is strong, but was it justified? In terms of the situation, the daughter's mental health is a priority. If the husband and mother were undermining her progress, the author had a reason to act. However, the method might be questionable. Using strong language could be seen as inappropriate, but the intent was to protect her daughter.\n\nAnother angle: the husband didn't apologize when the daughter was upset. The mother continued the criticism after the daughter was crying. So, the author intervened when they didn't stop. That might justify her reaction. The question is whether losing her temper was wrong, or a necessary defense of her daughter.\n\nPossible factors: 1. The daughter's well-being. 2. Public criticism in front of her. 3. The husband's failure to apologize. 4. The mother's persistence in the criticism. 5. The author's intent to protect her daughter.\n\nOn the other hand, the author could have handled it differently. Maybe talking to them privately, or addressing the issue without strong language. But given the emotional state of the daughter and the ongoing public humiliation, the author's reaction might be seen as justified.\n\nAlso, the daughter is an adult, so the mother and husband have a responsibility to be respectful. The author's outburst was a reaction to protect her daughter from further harm. So, while the method might be harsh, the intent is protective.\n\nIn terms of accountability, the mother and husband's actions were the root cause. The author's response, though strong, was in defense of her daughter's mental health. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
