We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their mother and husband to \"fuck off\" in a specific situation. I need to analyze the situation carefully.\n\nFirst, the daughter in the scenario is 26, has been through a tough breakup, is dealing with clinical depression, and is now working towards recovery by getting a job, going to school, and attending therapy. The parents, the author (probably the mother), her husband, and their daughter are involved. The main issue here is that the husband and the mother-in-law criticized the daughter's messiness in front of her, which upset the daughter. The author lost her temper and told them to \"fuck off\" or leave, then took the daughter out to calm down. Now, they haven't spoken to each other since, and the author is unsure if they were in the wrong.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but is curious about my perspective. I need to consider the context. The daughter is struggling with mental health and has made significant progress. The father and mother-in-law's public criticism in front of her, without apologizing when she expressed hurt, might have been the trigger. The author intervened to protect their daughter's feelings, which is a protective response. However, using such strong language might be seen as inappropriate, even if the intent was good.\n\nOn one hand, the author's actions were to defend their daughter from what they perceived as hurtful criticism, which could be justified given the daughter's mental health. On the other hand, the outburst might be seen as disrespectful to family members, even if they were being unkind. The key factors here are the context of the daughter's mental health, the public nature of the criticism, and the lack of apology from the husband and mother-in-law. The author's emotional reaction could be viewed as a necessary stand to protect their daughter, but the language used is harsh, which might make the author technically in the wrong, depending on cultural or personal values.\n\nI need to weigh the intent versus the action. The author's intent was to protect their daughter, which is a positive intent. However, the method used was aggressive. In some perspectives, the author's action is understandable under the circumstances. In others, using such language is a misstep regardless of the reason. The question is whether the author's reaction was proportionate. Given that the daughter was in emotional distress and the criticism was public and unapologetic, the author might not be in the wrong. However, the harsh language is a point against them. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the harm caused by the criticism was more significant than the harm caused by the author's outburst. Since the daughter's mental health is at stake, the author's action might be seen as justified. Therefore, the answer might be B (not in the wrong). But if the focus is solely on the language used, then A. However, given the context, B seems more appropriate.\n"
