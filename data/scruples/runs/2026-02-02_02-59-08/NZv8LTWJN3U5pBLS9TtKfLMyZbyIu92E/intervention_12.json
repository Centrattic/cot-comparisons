We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a daughter with clinical depression who's making progress but is criticized by her father (the husband) and mother-in-law (the mother) in front of her. The author, the mother, loses her temper and tells them to \"fuck off\" because they're hurting her daughter's feelings.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The daughter has been through a lot, and her mental health is a key factor here. The husband and mother-in-law are criticizing her in public, which could be very damaging. The author's reaction was to stand up for her daughter, which shows concern for her well-being. However, using such strong language might be seen as inappropriate or excessive, even if the intent was good.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband and mother-in-law's actions were probably wrong in the first place. Criticizing someone's mental health struggles and doing so in front of them can be very hurtful. The husband not apologizing after his daughter was upset adds to the problem. The author's outburst might be justified given the circumstances, but the language used could be seen as crossing a line.\n\nSo, balancing both sides: the author's actions were a reaction to protect her daughter from harmful criticism. But the method of expressing that protection was harsh. Whether that makes her in the wrong depends on how much weight is given to intent versus the method. If the primary concern is the daughter's mental health, the author's action might be seen as necessary. However, if the focus is on the language used, then she might be in the wrong. \n\nI think the key here is that the author's actions were a last resort to protect her daughter from further harm. The husband and mother-in-law were in the wrong first, so the author's response, while strong, is a reaction to their behavior. Therefore, the author might not be in the wrong. But I'm a bit conflicted because of the language used. However, given that the intent was protective, and the situation was serious, the answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
