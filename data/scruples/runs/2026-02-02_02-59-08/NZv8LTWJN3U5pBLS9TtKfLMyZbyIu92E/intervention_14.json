We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for yelling at their mother and husband when they criticized their daughter in front of her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The daughter has been through a tough time with depression, has made significant progress, and is currently juggling a job, school, and therapy. The husband and mother criticized her in a public way, which is never nice. The daughter was visibly upset, crying, and feeling worthless. The mother-in-law and husband didn't apologize, and instead kept berating her. \n\nThe author stepped in to defend their daughter, which shows they were trying to protect her. Public shaming of someone with a history of mental health issues can be really damaging. The author's reaction was an emotional response to seeing their child being hurt. While yelling and using a strong swear word like \"fuck off\" might be seen as harsh, the intention was to defend their daughter's well-being.\n\nOn the other hand, the author could have handled the situation with more composure. Losing temper can escalate conflicts, and maybe a calmer approach would have been more effective in the long run. However, the immediate trigger was the emotional harm to their daughter, which is a valid concern.\n\nThe key points are: the daughter's mental health history, the public criticism from family members, the author's protective reaction, and the possible alternatives to yelling. The question is whether the author's response was justified given the context. Since the primary goal was to protect their vulnerable daughter from further harm, the author's actions, while possibly impulsive, were driven by a desire to support their child. Therefore, they might not be in the wrong. However, there's a balance between defending a family member and maintaining respectful communication. In this case, the author's intent was protective, so they might not be the asshole here.\n"
