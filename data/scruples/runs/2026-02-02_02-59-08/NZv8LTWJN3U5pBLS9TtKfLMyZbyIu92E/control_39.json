We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for yelling at their mother and husband during a visit. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the daughter came back from a bad relationship and was dealing with depression. She's made a lot of progress, getting a job, going to school, therapy. The husband is annoyed by her messiness, which is understandable, but maybe he's not considering her current challenges. The mother and husband talk about this in front of her, even bringing up her cat's litter box. The daughter gets emotional, and the author steps in, telling them to back off or \"fuck off.\"\n\nSo, the key points here are: the daughter's mental health is fragile, the parents are criticizing her publicly, which could set her back. The author acted to protect her. The husband didn't apologize, and the mother continued the criticism. \n\nThe author's outburst was in defense of their daughter. While the language was harsh, the intent was protective. The situation likely caused the daughter emotional distress, so the author might have felt it necessary to intervene. However, the mother and husband might feel disrespected by the language used. But considering the context of the daughter's mental health and the public criticism, the author's actions could be seen as justified. \n\nThe answer probably leans towards the author not being in the wrong because they were protecting their daughter from harmful criticism. The husband and mother's behavior might have been more at fault for not being considerate of the daughter's feelings. So, the answer would be B (No).\n"
