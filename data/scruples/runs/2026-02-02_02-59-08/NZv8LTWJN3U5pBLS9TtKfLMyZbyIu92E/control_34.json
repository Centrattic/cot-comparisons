We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author, their husband, their mother, and their daughter. \n\nFirst, the daughter has been through a tough time with depression but is making progress. She's working, in school, and in therapy. The husband and mother criticized her in front of her, which upset her. The daughter was crying and felt bad about herself. The author then lost their temper and told the parents to \"fuck off,\" leading to a fallout.\n\nThe key points here are the public shaming of the daughter by her father and grandmother. Public criticism, especially when someone is vulnerable, can be really harmful. The daughter was already struggling with her mental health, and being criticized in front of others could exacerbate her issues. The author intervened to protect their daughter's feelings, which is a natural response when a loved one is being attacked.\n\nHowever, the author's response was to yell and issue an ultimatum. While the intent was to protect the daughter, the method involved using harsh language (\"fuck off\") and creating a rift with the husband and mother. The husband didn't apologize, which adds to the tension.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit nuanced. The husband and mother's behavior was inappropriate\u2014they should have considered the daughter's feelings and discussed the issue privately. The author's reaction was a defense of their child, which is understandable, but the choice of words and the decision to cut off communication might have been harsh. However, given the context of the daughter's mental health and the emotional impact of the public criticism, the author's actions can be seen as a protective measure. The question is whether the harshness of the response outweighs the intention to protect the daughter. In many cases, people might empathize with the author's stance because protecting a vulnerable family member is important, even if the method could be debated. So, the answer might lean towards B (Not in the wrong), but there's room for discussion about the appropriateness of the response.\n"
