We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The story is about the author telling their mother and husband to \"fuck off\" after they criticized their daughter in front of her. The daughter has been through a tough time with depression and is trying to rebuild her life. The husband and mother were making her feel bad about her messiness and cat care, leading to the daughter feeling like a \"piece of shit.\"\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The daughter is in a vulnerable state, dealing with depression and working hard to improve her life. The parents' criticism, especially in front of her, could be damaging. The author intervened to protect their daughter's feelings, which is a valid concern. The husband not apologizing and the mother continuing the criticism might have pushed the author to lose their temper. \n\nOn the other hand, using strong language like \"fuck off\" is definitely a strong reaction. The author typically has a good relationship with both their mother and husband, so this outburst is out of character. The question is whether the means justified the ends. The author's intention was to protect their daughter, but the method might be seen as excessive. \n\nHowever, the emotional context is crucial here. The daughter was crying and feeling devalued. The author's reaction, while harsh, was in response to an emotionally charged situation where their daughter's mental health was at risk. In such cases, people might prioritize their child's well-being over the immediate social consequences. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It depends on the perspective. If the focus is on the use of harsh language and the lack of a more measured approach, then A (in the wrong) might be the answer. But if the focus is on protecting a vulnerable daughter from harmful criticism, then B (not in the wrong) could be justified. The key is whether the action was the right response given the circumstances. \n\nI think the moral of the story here is that while the language was harsh, the author's intent was protective. The husband and mother's actions were inappropriate, and the author's reaction, though extreme, was a response to that. Therefore, the author might not be in the wrong because they prioritized their daughter's emotional health in a critical moment. So, the answer would be B.\n"
