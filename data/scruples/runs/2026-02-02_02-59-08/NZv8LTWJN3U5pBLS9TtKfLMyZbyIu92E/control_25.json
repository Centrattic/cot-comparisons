We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves family dynamics where the daughter is recovering from depression, and her parents and mother-in-law criticized her in front of her, leading to an emotional outburst.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The daughter has made significant progress in her life, but the husband and mother-in-law publicly criticized her about her messiness and cat care in front of her. The daughter was upset, crying, and felt like a \"piece of shit.\" The author, the mother, intervened by telling them to stop or leave, which caused a rift.\n\nThe main question is whether the author's response was justified. On one hand, publicly criticizing someone with a history of depression could be harmful and contribute to relapse. The author's intervention might be seen as protecting their daughter's mental health. On the other hand, using harsh language like \"fuck off\" could be seen as inappropriate, but the context is a stressful situation where the daughter's well-being is at stake.\n\nI should consider if the author's actions were a reasonable reaction given the circumstances. The husband didn't apologize, and the mother continued the criticism. The author's outburst was a direct response to protect their daughter, which might be seen as justified. However, the use of strong language might be seen as unprofessional or disrespectful. But in the context of a family emergency where a loved one is being emotionally harmed, some might argue it's understandable.\n\nThe answer hinges on balancing the intent to protect against the method used. Since the primary goal was to stop the harmful criticism and support their daughter's recovery, the author's actions could be viewed as justified despite the harsh language. Therefore, the answer would be B (not in the wrong).\n"
