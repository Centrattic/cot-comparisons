We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation involves a daughter-in-law who's dealing with depression and has improved a lot, but her messiness is an issue. The mother and husband criticized her in front of her, leading the author to snap and tell them to fuck off.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The daughter has a history of depression and has made significant progress. Public criticism from family members could trigger a relapse. The author intervened to protect their daughter's mental health, which seems like a valid concern. However, the method used\u2014yelling and using harsh language\u2014might be seen as excessive.\n\nOn the other hand, the mother and husband were berating the daughter in front of her, which is inappropriate. The husband didn't apologize when the daughter was upset, which adds to the tension. The author's reaction, while strong, was in defense of their daughter. But does that justify the language used?\n\nIt's a balance between protecting a vulnerable family member and maintaining respectful communication. The author might feel justified given the stakes of their daughter's mental health. However, the response could have been more constructive. The key points are the intent to protect versus the method of confrontation. Depending on cultural norms and personal values, the answer might vary. But generally, while the intent is good, the approach could be questioned. However, given the emotional state of the daughter, the author's actions might be seen as a necessary intervention. So, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong), but there's room for interpretation.\n"
