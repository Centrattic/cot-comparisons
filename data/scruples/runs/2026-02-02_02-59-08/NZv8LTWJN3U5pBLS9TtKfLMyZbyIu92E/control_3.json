We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the AITA post) is in the wrong for telling her mother and husband to \"fuck off\" after they criticized her daughter in front of her.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The daughter has a history of depression and has been making progress. The husband and mother criticized her for being messy and not taking care of the cat, which upset the daughter. The author felt the need to defend her daughter, leading to her outburst.\n\nNow, considering the relationships: the author's husband and mother have a history of being supportive, but this instance was a public criticism of the daughter. The daughter was already vulnerable, and their comments led to her emotional breakdown. The author stepped in to protect her, which is a natural response for a parent.\n\nThe key points here are the intent and the impact. The author's outburst was a reaction to protecting her child from further harm. While the language used was harsh, it was in defense of the daughter's mental health. However, using such strong language might have been the wrong approach, but the underlying motivation was to protect her child.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband and mother's actions in the first place were problematic. They should have been more considerate of the daughter's feelings, given her history. The author's response, while not ideal in terms of communication, was a reaction to a stressful and emotionally charged situation.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, people often consider whether the action was justified. Here, the author's action was a result of trying to defend her daughter from what she perceived as harmful criticism. The severity of the daughter's reaction (sobbing and self-deprecating comments) adds weight to the author's justification.\n\nBut the use of profanity could be seen as unkind, even if the intent was good. However, given the circumstances, it's a heated moment. The author hasn't reached out to apologize, but she feels justified due to her concern for her daughter's well-being.\n\nSo, considering all factors, while the language was harsh, the author's action was in defense of her daughter's mental health. Therefore, the answer would be B (not in the wrong).\n"
