We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author yelling at their husband and mother in front of their daughter because they were criticized for the daughter's messiness and inability to take care of the cat.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The daughter was dealing with depression, made significant progress, and the parents are supportive. However, the husband is annoyed by her messiness. The mother-in-law and husband discussed this in front of the daughter, which upset her. The daughter then felt criticized, leading the author to lose their temper and tell them to \"fuck off.\"\n\nThe key points here are intent and consequence. The author's intention was to protect their daughter's feelings and mental health, which is a valid concern. However, the method they used\u2014yelling and using harsh language\u2014might be seen as a problem. Even though the situation was stressful, the author's response could have been more constructive, like addressing the issue privately without public confrontation.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband and mother-in-law criticized the daughter in a public setting, which is unkind and could be seen as disrespectful. The author's outburst was a reaction to protect their daughter, which shows they care deeply. But is it justified? Sometimes, even in emotional situations, maintaining composure is important to set a good example, especially for children. However, the daughter was already upset, so maybe the author's immediate reaction was a way to provide support.\n\nBalancing both sides: while the author's actions were impulsive and could have been handled differently, the underlying reason\u2014protecting a vulnerable family member\u2014is understandable. The husband and mother-in-law also contributed by being critical publicly. So, is the author at fault? It's a bit of a toss-up. The author's intent was good, but the method was harsh. However, given the emotional stakes and the daughter's mental health, maybe the author isn't entirely in the wrong. But they could have communicated differently. Hmm. Maybe the answer is B (Not in the wrong) because the primary wrongdoing was from the husband and mother, and the author's reaction, while strong, was in defense of their daughter. But I'm a bit conflicted.\n"
