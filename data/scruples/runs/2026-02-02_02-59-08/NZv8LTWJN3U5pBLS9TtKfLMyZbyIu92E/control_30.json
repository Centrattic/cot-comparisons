We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author lashing out at their mother and husband after they criticized the author's daughter in front of her, which led to the daughter being upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The daughter is 26, has a history of depression, and has been making progress. The parents are trying to support her, but the husband and mother publicly criticized her for being messy and not taking care of the cat. The daughter was already crying and feeling bad about herself. The author intervened by telling her mother and husband to \"fuck off\" and then left with the daughter.\n\nNow, evaluating if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are the public shaming in front of the daughter, the daughter's emotional state, and the author's reaction. The mother and husband were likely overstepping by berating the daughter, especially given her mental health history. The author's outburst was a reaction to protect the daughter's feelings, which is understandable. However, using a harsh expletive might be seen as aggressive. But in the context of someone who is usually calm, this could be a justified reaction to protect a vulnerable family member. The author's intention was to defend their daughter, not to be disrespectful without cause. The mother and husband's actions were contributing to the daughter's low self-esteem, so the author's intervention was in line with supporting the daughter's well-being. Therefore, while the language was strong, the underlying reason is valid. So the answer is probably B (not in the wrong).\n"
