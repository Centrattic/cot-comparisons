We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's husband and mother criticizing their daughter, who has depression and has been working hard to recover. The parents discussed her messiness in front of her, leading to an emotional breakdown. The author lost her temper and told them to \"fuck off,\" then took the daughter to calm down. Now the author is conflicted about whether they were right to act that way.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The daughter is dealing with depression and has made significant progress. The husband and mother criticized her in front of her, which directly hurt her mental health. The author intervened to protect her daughter, which is a strong motivator. The author's outburst was a reaction to the ongoing criticism from family members, which the author likely felt was unjust and harmful.\n\nThe husband didn't apologize when the daughter was upset, and the mother continued the criticism. The author's response was to defend the daughter, which could be seen as justified given the context. However, the use of harsh language (\"fuck off\") might be seen as inappropriate by some, even if the intention was protective. \n\nBut considering the emotional state of the daughter and the fact that the parents were contributing to her distress, the author's actions might be viewed as a necessary intervention. The question is whether the method was wrong. In many cases, people might argue that protecting a vulnerable family member from harmful criticism is the right thing, even if the response was emotional.\n\nOn the other hand, some might say that the author should have handled it calmly, maybe through private conversations rather than a public outburst. However, the immediate context was a public shaming situation, so the author's reaction could be seen as a defense against ongoing harm. The daughter's mental health is a critical factor here. \n\nSo, weighing the intent to protect her daughter against the method of confrontation, the answer might hinge on whether the author's approach was proportionate. The key here is that the author's action was in defense of a vulnerable individual, and the criticism from the parents was unwarranted given the daughter's progress and her struggles. Therefore, the author's \"wrongdoing\" might be minimal, especially considering the context. However, the harsh language could be a point of contention. But in many \"AITA\" scenarios, protecting a family member's mental health is often viewed as a strong mitigating factor.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's method could be debated, the intent to protect their daughter from harmful criticism is understandable and possibly justified. Therefore, the author might not be in the wrong.\n"
