We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a daughter with depression and anxiety, and the mother and husband criticizing her for being messy in front of her. The author lost their temper and told her mother and husband to \"fuck off,\" then left to comfort their daughter.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The daughter is working on improving herself after a tough breakup and depression. She's taking steps forward with a job, school, therapy, etc. However, her slobbishness is an issue that the husband is pointing out, which the author of the post is more lenient towards. The mother and husband then berate the daughter in front of her, leading the author to snap.\n\nNow, the author's actions: they yelled and told the mother and husband to either be respectful or \"fuck off,\" then took the daughter to get food. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for this outburst.\n\nI should consider the context. The daughter is vulnerable, dealing with mental health issues. Publicly criticizing her, especially by family members, could potentially hinder her recovery. The author intervened to protect the daughter's feelings, which is understandable, especially since the daughter was breaking down emotionally. However, the method used was a harsh outburst. \n\nOn one hand, standing up for a vulnerable family member is commendable, but the manner\u2014using a curse word and cutting off communication\u2014might be seen as excessive. The author might have wanted to defend their daughter but could have done so more constructively. On the other hand, the mother and husband's behavior in berating the daughter in front of others is questionable. They didn't apologize, which adds to the tension.\n\nThe key here is whether the author's reaction was proportionate. The daughter was clearly upset and in a fragile state. The parents' public criticism might have been a trigger. The author's outburst was a reaction to protect the daughter, but the choice of words and the decision not to reconcile immediately could be seen as impulsive. However, the underlying reason\u2014protecting a family member's mental health\u2014is valid.\n\nIn terms of social norms, while swearing can be seen as rude, the context of defending a loved one might be considered excusable. The author might be seen as justified in the moment, even if the method wasn't ideal. However, some might argue that the author should have handled it more calmly to maintain family relationships.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the answer might be a bit nuanced. The author's intention was protective, but the method was harsh. Whether they are in the wrong depends on whether the action was proportionate. Since the daughter was in a vulnerable state and the mother and husband didn't apologize, the author's reaction could be seen as a necessary defense, making the author not in the wrong. So the answer might be B (No).\n"
