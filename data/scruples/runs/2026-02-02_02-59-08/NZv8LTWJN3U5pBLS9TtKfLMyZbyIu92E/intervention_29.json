We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves their daughter, who's been struggling with depression but has improved. The husband and mother criticized the daughter in front of her, leading to her emotional breakdown. The author lost their temper and told them both to fuck off.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The daughter has a lot on her plate: job, school, therapy. The husband is annoyed by her messiness, which the author is more forgiving of. The mother and husband criticized her in front of her, which was really hurtful. The daughter started crying and feeling like a piece of shit. The author intervened by yelling at them.\n\nThe author is now wondering if they're in the wrong. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know my take. \n\nLet me break it down. Were the husband and mother right to criticize the daughter in front of her? Probably not. Public criticism, especially when someone is vulnerable, is generally not a good approach. The daughter was in a fragile state, and their comments made her feel bad, which could set back her mental health. The author's reaction was to protect their daughter, even if it was harsh. \n\nBut the author used strong language (\"fuck off\") which might be seen as inappropriate. However, the intent was to defend their daughter from further harm. The key points are the intent behind the action and the context. The author was trying to prevent their daughter from feeling worse, which is a protective measure. The husband didn't apologize when the daughter said his words hurt her, so he's not without fault. The mother also contributed by agreeing and being part of the criticism.\n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, maybe the author isn't entirely at fault because they were reacting to a harmful situation. But the method of reaction (harsh language) might be questionable. However, given the emotional context and the daughter's mental health, some might argue that the author's outburst was justified as a last resort to protect their child. \n\nOn the other hand, the author could have handled it differently without swearing. But the immediate priority was to stop the hurtful comments. The question is whether the method of intervention was wrong. Since the husband and mother were the ones who started the problem by criticizing in front of her, the author's response, while strong, was a defense of their daughter's well-being. So maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong) because the author acted to protect their daughter from emotional harm caused by others.\n"
