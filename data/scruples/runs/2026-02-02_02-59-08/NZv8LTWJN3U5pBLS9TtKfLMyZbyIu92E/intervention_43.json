We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the person who posted the story (the author) is in the wrong for yelling at their mother and husband.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The daughter is recovering from depression and has a lot going on, including a new job, school, and therapy. She's also struggling with being a slob, which the husband is upset about. The mother and husband criticized her in front of her, leading to her crying and feeling bad about herself. The author then snapped and told them to either be respectful or \"fuck off.\"\n\nSo, the key points here: the daughter is in a vulnerable state, the parents are criticizing her, and the author intervened to protect her. The question is whether the author overstepped by using harsh language.\n\nOn one hand, the author's intention was to defend their daughter's mental health, which is important. Public criticism, especially in front of a dependent adult, can be harmful, especially when that person is still recovering. The husband not apologizing after seeing his daughter distressed is a red flag. The mother's behavior in continuing the criticism after the daughter was upset is also problematic.\n\nOn the other hand, using profanity and a harsh tone might not be the most effective way to handle the situation. It could have damaged relationships with the mother and husband. However, the author's action was a response to protect their daughter from further emotional harm.\n\nThe author's actions, while harsh, were motivated by a desire to protect their daughter. The husband and mother's behavior was inconsiderate given the daughter's fragile mental state. So, while the method might be questionable, the intent was to defend their child's well-being. \n\nConsidering that the daughter's mental health is a priority, and the parents were contributing to her distress, the author's outburst, though not ideal, might be justified in this context. The real issue lies with how the husband and mother handled the situation. Therefore, the author might not be in the wrong here.\n"
