We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author's husband and mother criticized the daughter in front of her, which upset the daughter a lot. The daughter has a history of depression and was making progress, so being criticized about her messiness and cat care in front of her must have been really hurtful.\n\nThe author lost her temper and told them to either be respectful or fuck off, then left. Now they're not speaking to her. The question is whether she's at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The daughter is 26, back in school, working full-time, and in therapy. She's had a tough time recovering from depression, so any negative comments from family could set her back. The parents and husband criticized her in front of her, which is pretty harsh, especially when she's still struggling with self-esteem issues.\n\nThe author's husband didn't apologize when the daughter was upset. The mother continued the criticism even after the daughter was crying. That seems really insensitive. So the author stepped in to protect her daughter, which is a natural reaction. Yelling might not be the best way to handle things, but the intent was to stop the hurtful comments.\n\nOn the other hand, using strong language like \"fuck off\" is probably not the most constructive approach. It might have been an emotional reaction, but it caused a rift in the family. However, given the daughter's mental health and the immediate need to protect her, the author might have felt that this was necessary.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? She did act out of concern for her daughter's well-being. But maybe there's a better way to handle it. However, in the heat of the moment, emotions can take over. The key points are the daughter's vulnerability and the criticism from the husband and mother. The author's actions were to defend her daughter, which is a protective instinct. While the method was harsh, the intent was to stop the harm.\n\nI think the main issue here is the public shaming and criticism of the daughter by the other two, which was inappropriate. The author's reaction, though strong, was a response to protect her daughter's mental health. So maybe she's not in the wrong because she acted to prevent further harm. However, the use of such language might be seen as crossing a line. But considering the circumstances, perhaps the answer is no, she's not in the wrong.\n"
