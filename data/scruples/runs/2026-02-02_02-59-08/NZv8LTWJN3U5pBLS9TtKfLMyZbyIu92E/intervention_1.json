We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for yelling at her mother and husband. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the daughter has been through a tough time with a bad relationship and depression. She moved in and has been doing well now, working and going to school. The husband is frustrated with her messiness, which the mom agrees with. They ended up criticizing her in front of her, which upset the daughter. The daughter then cried and felt really bad about herself. The author stepped in and told her mom and husband to stop or else they'd have dinner alone.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is at fault. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to consider both sides. On one hand, yelling and using harsh language like \"fuck off\" can be seen as losing control and not the best way to handle a conflict. It might have been a strong reaction, but the context is that the daughter's mental health is a big concern here. The author was defending her daughter from criticism, which could have been damaging given her history of depression.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband and mother were pointing out the daughter's messiness. Maybe they didn't mean to be harsh, but doing it in front of her was unkind. The author's outburst might have been a result of protecting her daughter from emotional harm. However, the method of confrontation could have been handled differently. Instead of yelling, maybe a calm discussion or addressing the issue privately would have been better. \n\nThe daughter's well-being is central here. If her parents-in-law continue to criticize her, it could affect her recovery. The author might have felt that she couldn't let them continue without intervening. But using such strong language might have caused a rift in her relationships with her husband and mother. \n\nI should also consider the dynamics. The husband didn't apologize when the daughter was upset, which is problematic. The mother continued the criticism even after seeing the daughter cry. The author's reaction, while extreme, was in defense of her daughter's emotional state. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's tricky. The author's intention was to protect her daughter, which is understandable. But the method of confrontation might not have been the best approach. However, given the context of the daughter's mental health, the author might have felt it was necessary to act quickly. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a judgment call. The answer could be A or B depending on perspective. But since the user thinks A, but I need to evaluate. Maybe the key point is that the author's actions were a reaction to protect her daughter from harmful criticism, even if the method was harsh. That might lean towards B (not in the wrong). Alternatively, if the situation could have been handled better without yelling, then A. \n\nBut considering the daughter's mental health and the immediate need to stop the criticism, the author's outburst might be justified. So I'm leaning towards B.\n"
