We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the daughter is doing really well after overcoming depression, but her parents and the mother-in-law are criticizing her for being messy and not taking care of her cat. The author steps in and tells her husband and mother to \"fuck off\" because they're hurting her daughter's feelings.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The daughter has a lot on her plate\u2014job, school, therapy. The author is supportive, while the husband and mother are being critical. The criticism happens in front of the daughter, making her cry and feel bad about herself. The author intervenes to protect her daughter's mental health.\n\nIs the author wrong for getting angry? Well, they were trying to defend their daughter from verbal abuse. The husband didn't apologize, and the mother-in-law continued the criticism. The author's actions were a reaction to protect their child's emotional well-being. While the language used was harsh, the intent was protective. \n\nOn the other hand, the husband and mother were being disrespectful in front of the daughter, which isn't appropriate. The author's response might be seen as a justified reaction given the vulnerability of the daughter's mental health. However, using strong language could be seen as reactive. But considering the circumstances, the main issue is the criticism from the others. \n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because they were defending their daughter. The key point is that the daughter's mental health is at stake, and the parents' actions were harmful. The author's outburst was a response to protect her, which might be understandable even if the words were harsh.\n"
