We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for yelling at her mother and husband. The situation involves the daughter recovering from depression, and the parents criticizing her in front of her, which led to her emotional breakdown. The author intervened to protect her daughter.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The daughter has been making progress in her recovery, which is a fragile time. The husband and mother publicly criticized her about her messiness and the cat, which is a sensitive topic since the daughter already has a lot on her plate. The daughter's reaction was severe\u2014crying and self-deprecating statements. The author's response was to confront them, which stopped the immediate harm.\n\nFrom a psychological perspective, public shaming can be detrimental to someone with depression. The author acted to protect her daughter's mental health, which is a valid concern. The husband didn't apologize, so the situation wasn't being addressed from his side. The mother continued the criticism even after the daughter was upset, which compounds the issue.\n\nThe author's outburst was a reaction to defending her daughter, which isn't inherently wrong. However, the use of strong language might be seen as harsh, but given the circumstances, it could be justified as a protective measure. The key factors are the daughter's well-being and the public criticism that triggered her emotional state. The author prioritized her daughter's mental health, which is a responsible action. While the method of confrontation is intense, the intent was protective. So the answer would lean towards B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
