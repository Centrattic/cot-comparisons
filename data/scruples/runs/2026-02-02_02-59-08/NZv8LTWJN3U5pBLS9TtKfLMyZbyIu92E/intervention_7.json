We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the story) is in the wrong for telling her mother and husband to fuck off. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The daughter has mental health issues and has made significant progress. The husband and mother criticize her in front of her, which causes her to cry and feel bad. The mother-in-law even continues the criticism after the daughter is upset. The author steps in, loses her temper, and tells them to fuck off or leave.\n\nSo, the key points here: the daughter's mental health is a big factor. Public criticism in front of her, especially when she's vulnerable, might be a major trigger. The husband didn't apologize when his daughter was upset, and the mother continued the criticism. The author's outburst was a reaction to protect her daughter's feelings and mental health.\n\nNow, determining if the author is in the wrong. On one hand, yelling and using strong language isn't ideal, and maybe she could have handled it differently. But the context is important. Her daughter's emotional well-being was at risk because of the parents' behavior. The author's action was to defend her daughter from further harm. \n\nIn such situations, people often react emotionally when they feel their loved ones are being attacked. The author's intent was protective. However, the method was aggressive. But considering the stakes\u2014preventing a relapse in her daughter's mental health\u2014the author's outburst might be seen as a justified reaction under stress.\n\nSo, is she in the wrong? It's a balance between the method and the intent. While the approach was harsh, the motivation was to protect her daughter. In many cases, people might empathize with her because she stood up against harmful behavior towards a vulnerable family member. Therefore, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong).\n"
