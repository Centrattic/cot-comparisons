We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a daughter who's recovering from depression, a husband and mother criticizing her in front of her, and the author (the parent) losing their temper.\n\nFirst, the daughter is doing well after a tough time. She's working, in school, and in therapy. But she still has a slob issue, which the husband and mother-in-law criticize. The author is caught between supporting their daughter and the criticism from their spouse and mother. \n\nThe key points here are the public shaming by the husband and mother, which led to the daughter feeling terrible and crying. The author intervened when the criticism continued even after the daughter was upset. The author's outburst was a reaction to protect their child's mental health. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the husband and mother were being disrespectful to the daughter in a vulnerable moment. The author's response, while harsh, was an attempt to defend their child. The daughter's mental health is a critical factor here. The author might feel justified because they were protecting their child from further harm. However, using such strong language could be seen as overreacting. But considering the context\u2014the daughter's fragile state and the public criticism\u2014it's a protective response. \n\nOn the other hand, the author could have handled it differently, like addressing the issue privately. But given the immediate harm being done, the intervention might be necessary. The question is whether the method was wrong. The answer likely leans towards the author not being in the wrong because their action was to shield their daughter from emotional abuse. So, the answer is B.\n"
