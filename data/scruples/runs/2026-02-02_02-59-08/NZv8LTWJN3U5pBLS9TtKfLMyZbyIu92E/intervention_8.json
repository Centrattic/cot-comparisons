We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves their daughter, husband, and mother. The daughter is recovering from depression and has a lot going on, like a new job and school. The husband and mother criticized her for being messy in front of her, even bringing up her cat's litter box. The daughter got upset, and the author yelled at them to stop.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The daughter is in a vulnerable position, trying to improve her life. Public criticism from family members can be really harmful, especially when someone is in recovery from mental health issues. The husband didn't apologize, which might have made the situation worse. The author stepped in to protect their daughter, which shows concern for her well-being. \n\nBut did the author overreact? Yelling and using harsh language like \"fuck off\" is not ideal. However, the situation was emotionally charged. The daughter was sobbing and feeling like a \"piece of shit,\" which is serious. The author's actions were a defense of their daughter's emotional state. \n\nOn the other hand, the author could have handled it more calmly, maybe by addressing the issue privately after the situation cooled down. However, given the urgency of the daughter's emotional state, the immediate reaction might have been necessary. \n\nConsidering the mental health aspects and the potential long-term impact of the criticism, the author's outburst might be seen as a justified response to protect their daughter. But the language used was harsh. However, in the heat of the moment, emotions can lead to such reactions. \n\nSo, balancing the immediate need to protect the daughter versus the method used. The author's primary intention was protective, which is a strong point in their favor. But the method could have been better. But since the alternative was letting the daughter feel worse, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they are in the wrong because they could have handled it without yelling. But the context is crucial here. The daughter's mental health is at stake. \n\nI think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong because they acted to protect their daughter from harmful criticism, especially given her mental health struggles. The anger was a response to a stressful and emotionally charged situation. While the language was harsh, the underlying motivation was protective, which is important.\n"
