We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's husband and mother criticizing their daughter in front of her, leading the author to yell at them and tell them to fuck off. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The daughter in question is 26, has a history of clinical depression, and has made significant progress by getting a job, going back to school, and seeing a therapist. The husband and mother are criticizing her for being messy and not taking care of the cat. The key here is that the daughter is already vulnerable with her mental health, and public criticism from family members might be harmful.\n\nThe author intervened when the husband and mother were being unkind, especially after the daughter was crying and feeling like a piece of shit. The author took her out to calm down. The question is whether the author's reaction was justified or not.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it depends on the context. The husband and mother were being disrespectful in front of the daughter, which could exacerbate her depression. The author stepped in to protect her daughter, which is a protective act. However, the method was yelling and using a strong swear word. \n\nOn one hand, the author might be justified because they were defending their daughter's mental health. On the other hand, using harsh language can be seen as inappropriate. But considering the daughter's well-being and the fact that the husband didn't apologize, maybe the author's reaction was a necessary defense.\n\nI need to consider cultural norms and whether the severity of the situation justifies the outburst. The daughter's mental health is at stake here. The husband and mother were in the wrong for berating her in front of her, so the author stepping in to stop that would be on the right side. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they were protecting their daughter from harmful criticism, which could negatively impact her mental health recovery.\n"
