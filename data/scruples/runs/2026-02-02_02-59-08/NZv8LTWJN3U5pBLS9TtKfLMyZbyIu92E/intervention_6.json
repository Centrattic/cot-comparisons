We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation involves the author telling their mother and husband to \"fuck off\" after they criticized their daughter in front of her. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The daughter was coming out of depression and had made significant progress. The husband and mother criticized her messiness and her cat care in front of her, which upset the daughter. The daughter then cried and felt everyone thought she was a piece of shit. The author intervened by yelling at her husband and mother to stop or leave. Now, the family members are upset, and the author is questioning their actions.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. The question is whether the author is wrong (A) or not (B). \n\nI need to consider the context. The author's daughter is in a vulnerable state, recovering from depression. Public criticism from family members could indeed be damaging. The author stepped in to protect their daughter's mental health, which is a valid concern. However, the method used was yelling and using a strong curse word. \n\nWhile the intent was protective, the manner might be seen as confrontational. The husband, who is usually in a good relationship with the author and the daughter, didn't apologize when she apologized. The mother didn't change her behavior either. The author's outburst might be seen as a reaction to a harmful situation, but the way they expressed it could have been more constructive. \n\nOn the other hand, considering the daughter's emotional state, the author's action might be justified as defending their child. The husband and mother's behavior was inappropriate, and the author felt they had no choice but to intervene. \n\nSo, there's a balance between protecting a loved one and handling the situation calmly. The author's actions were extreme but perhaps understandable given the circumstances. Whether they're in the wrong depends on cultural and personal values regarding conflict resolution. In some views, the author's intervention was necessary to protect the daughter's well-being. In others, the harsh language and approach could be seen as inconsiderate, even if the intent was good. \n\nI think the author isn't entirely in the wrong because they acted to protect their daughter's mental health. But there's also room to argue that a different approach could have been better. However, given the urgency of preventing further harm to the daughter, the author might be justified. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
