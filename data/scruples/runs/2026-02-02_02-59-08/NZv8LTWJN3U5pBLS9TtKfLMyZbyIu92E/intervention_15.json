We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The story is about a situation where the author yelled at their husband and mother because they were criticizing the author's daughter in front of her.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the key points. The daughter has been through a lot\u2014recently ended a bad relationship, moved back in, and has depression. She's making progress with a job, school, and therapy, which the husband knows. The issue arises when the husband and mother criticize the daughter's messiness and cat care in front of her. The author intervened and told them to stop, leading to a fallout.\n\nThe husband didn't apologize when the daughter was upset. The mother and husband continued their criticism even after the daughter was emotional. The author's reaction was to yell and tell them to \"fuck off,\" which is aggressive. The author feels bad about it but is also concerned about the daughter's mental health.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. The key is whether their actions were justified. The daughter's mental health is a major factor. Publicly criticizing her, especially when she's already struggling, could be harmful. The husband and mother weren't being supportive, which the author had to step in for. Yelling was a strong reaction, but the intent was to protect the daughter.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's response was harsh. Using such strong language might not be the best approach. However, given the context of protecting their child from further harm and the emotional state of the daughter, the author's actions might be seen as a necessary defense. The husband and mother's behavior was questionable, so the author's outburst could be a reaction to their lack of empathy.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a tough call. They acted out of concern for their daughter, but the method was extreme. However, given the circumstances, some might argue that the author's actions were justified to protect their child's well-being. Others might say the author should have handled it differently. The answer depends on whether the means (yelling) were appropriate given the ends (protecting the daughter's mental health).\n"
