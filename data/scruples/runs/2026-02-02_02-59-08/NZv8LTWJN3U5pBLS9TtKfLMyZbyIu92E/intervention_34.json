We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person in the \"AITA\" post) was in the wrong for yelling at her mother and husband.\n\nFirst, the situation involves the daughter who's recently come out of a difficult period. She's doing better now but still has a lot on her plate with work, school, and therapy. The parents (husband and mother) criticized her messiness in front of her, which upset her. The daughter was crying and felt bad about herself. The mother and husband didn't apologize and continued their criticism. The author intervened, telling them to stop or leave.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics: The daughter is in a vulnerable state, dealing with depression. Public criticism from family members, especially in front of her, could exacerbate her mental health issues. The parents are supposed to be supportive, but they're instead being critical, which is unhelpful. The author stepped in to protect her daughter from being further harmed, which is a protective act. The question is whether the method (yelling and telling them to fuck off) was appropriate.\n\nThe parents might argue that they were just pointing out the daughter's messiness, but doing so in front of her and without sensitivity is problematic. The author's main concern was the daughter's well-being, so her reaction, while emotional, was in response to protect her. However, yelling at family members is a strong action, and while understandable, it might be seen as extreme. But given the context\u2014trying to defend a vulnerable daughter from public criticism\u2014it's also a form of standing up for her.\n\nSo, the author's actions were a reaction to protect her daughter. The parents were being insensitive. The author might be in the right because she prioritized her daughter's mental health over maintaining harmony with her family. Even though the method was harsh, the intent was protective. Therefore, maybe the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
