We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves the author telling their mother and husband to \"fuck off\" after they criticized their daughter in front of her. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The daughter is 26, has depression, is working and in school, and has made significant progress. The husband and mother criticized her messiness and the cat's litter box in front of her, which upset her. The author intervened by yelling and telling them to leave, leading to a family rift.\n\nNow, analyzing the actions. The husband and mother were being critical in a public setting, which can be hurtful, especially for someone with mental health issues. The mother and husband didn't apologize, so the daughter felt attacked. The author's reaction was to defend their daughter, which is protective. However, using strong language like \"fuck off\" is confrontational. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? On one hand, they stood up for their daughter's mental health, which is crucial. On the other, the method was harsh. But the key here is the context: the daughter's well-being. The author might believe that their intervention was necessary to prevent further harm. However, the harsh language could be seen as excessive, even if the intent was good. \n\nBut considering the daughter's mental health history, the parents' public criticism could have a negative impact. The author's reaction, while strong, might be seen as a justified stand to protect their child. The question is whether the response was proportionate. Some might argue that the author didn't handle it calmly, but others might see it as a necessary action to stop the bullying. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, it's often about empathy and proportionality. The parents' behavior was inconsiderate, especially given the daughter's struggles. The author's outburst was a reaction to protect their child, which is a valid concern. So, the author isn't in the wrong because they prioritized their daughter's mental health. The answer would be B (No).\n"
