We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The situation involves the author yelling at her mother and husband after they criticized her daughter in front of her.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The daughter is recovering from depression and has been doing well, getting a job, going to school, and therapy. The husband is annoyed by her messiness, which the author is more lenient about. The mother and husband criticized the daughter in front of her, even bringing up the cat's litter box. The daughter was upset, and the husband didn't apologize. The author then told them to \"fuck off\" and took her daughter to calm down. Now, family relations are strained, and the author is questioning if they were wrong.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to assess both sides. The author's actions were a reaction to protect their daughter's mental health, which is a valid concern. The daughter was vulnerable, and public criticism could trigger regression. The husband and mother's behavior of discussing the daughter's habits in front of her, especially when she's already struggling, might be the root issue. However, the author's outburst was disrespectful and used harsh language, which could be seen as inappropriate even if their intentions were good.\n\nFactors to consider: The daughter's well-being vs. the method used to address the issue. The husband and mother's lack of apology and their behavior might justify the author's frustration. However, yelling and using such language might not be the best approach. The key question is whether the author crossed a line in their reaction. While protecting a child is important, the method could be debated. In some contexts, this might be seen as standing up for a vulnerable family member, but in others, it's seen as an overreaction.\n\nIn many cultures, using explicit language and telling family members to \"fuck off\" is considered disrespectful, regardless of the provocation. However, if the alternative is letting the daughter's mental health deteriorate, the author's action could be seen as a necessary stand. The story emphasizes the daughter's progress and the parents' unkindness. The author's action was a direct response to protect their child from further harm, but the method was extreme.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a balance between the intent (protecting the daughter) and the method (harsh language). If the answer is A (Yes), it's because the author used inappropriate language. If B (No), it's because they were defending their daughter's mental health. Different perspectives can be taken here. In many AITA scenarios, defending a vulnerable family member can be seen as justified, even if the method is harsh. So, the author might not be in the wrong.\n"
