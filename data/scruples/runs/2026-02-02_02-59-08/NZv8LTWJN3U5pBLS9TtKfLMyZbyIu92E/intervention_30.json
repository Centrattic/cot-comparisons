We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author, their husband, mother, and daughter.\n\nSo, the main issue is that the daughter, who's recovering from depression, was being criticized by her father and grandmother in front of her. The daughter was already under a lot of stress with a new job and school. The parents and grandmother talked about her messiness and the cat's litter box, which upset her. The daughter ended up sobbing and feeling like a \"piece of shit.\" The author then lost her temper and told her mother and husband to fuck off or leave, which led to them not speaking since. The author is now wondering if they're in the wrong.\n\nHmm. Let's consider the dynamics here. The daughter is in a vulnerable state, coming out of depression. Public criticism in front of her could be really damaging. The husband and mother were criticizing her, maybe without considering how it affects her mental health. The author stepped in to defend her daughter, which is a protective instinct. But the method was yelling and using a strong phrase like \"fuck off.\"\n\nOn one hand, the author's reaction was intense, and using that language might be seen as inappropriate or harsh. But on the other hand, the context is their daughter's emotional well-being. The author felt that the criticism from the husband and mother could set her daughter back. The husband didn't apologize when the daughter was hurt, which shows maybe he didn't realize the impact. The mother joined in, so the author's frustration is understandable.\n\nThe question is whether the author overreacted. The daughter's mental health is a priority here. The author intervened to protect her, which is a good intention. However, the way they did it\u2014yelling and using strong language\u2014might be seen as crossing a line, even if the intention was good. Maybe there's a balance between protecting the daughter and maintaining respectful communication with the husband and mother. \n\nBut let's think about the alternatives. If the author didn't speak up, the daughter might feel unsupported. The husband and mother might continue the harmful behavior. The author's response, while harsh, was in the moment of seeing their daughter in crisis. It's possible that the author felt there was no other way to stop the attack quickly. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a complex situation. The author's action was driven by concern for their daughter's mental health, which is valid. However, the method of confrontation could be seen as unproductive, even if the intent was good. The husband and mother might also be in the wrong for criticizing the daughter in front of her, not considering her condition. \n\nBut the question is specifically about the author. The AITA format usually considers if the person did something wrong. So even if the husband and mother are at fault, the author's own action is the focus. The author used aggressive language, which could strain family relationships. However, the context of defending a vulnerable daughter adds nuance. \n\nI think the answer might hinge on whether the author's reaction was proportionate. The daughter was in a vulnerable state, and the parents and mother were publicly criticizing her. The author intervened to stop the immediate harm. The use of strong language was a choice, but the underlying motivation was protective. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong because their action was a response to protect their daughter, even if the method was harsh. Alternatively, they could be seen as overreacting, leading to further family conflict. \n\nIn many AITA scenarios, people are often expected to handle conflicts with more temperance. However, when it comes to protecting a family member's mental health, the response might be more lenient. So perhaps the author isn't in the wrong because their action was driven by a desire to protect their daughter from psychological harm, even if the approach was not ideal. The husband and mother also have some accountability here for not being considerate of the daughter's mental state.\n"
