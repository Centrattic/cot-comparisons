We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is at fault (AITA) for yelling at their mother and husband during a situation involving their daughter.\n\nFirst, the context: The daughter, who's dealing with depression and has made significant progress, is being criticized by her father and the author's mother in front of her. The parents are commenting on her messiness and the cat's litter box, which leads to the daughter crying and feeling like a \"piece of shit.\" The author steps in, tells them to be respectful or else, and the parents haven't spoken to them since.\n\nThe key points here are the daughter's mental health history and the public criticism from the parents. The daughter is already under a lot of stress managing school, a job, and therapy. Public shaming about her habits, especially in front of family, could really set her back. The author's reaction was to protect their daughter, which is a natural parental instinct. While yelling might not be the ideal solution, the intent was to stop the parents from hurting the daughter further.\n\nOn the other hand, the parents (husband and mother) did cross a line by discussing the daughter's issues publicly and not showing empathy. The husband didn't apologize, and the mother continued the criticism, which escalated the situation. The author's outburst was a response to protect their child's mental health, which is a valid concern given the daughter's history.\n\nSo, while the author's method of response was harsh, the situation warranted a strong reaction to prevent harm. The parents' actions were the root cause, so the author isn't in the wrong for standing up for their daughter. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
