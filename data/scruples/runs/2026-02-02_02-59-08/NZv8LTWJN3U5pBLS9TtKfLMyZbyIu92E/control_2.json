We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. Let's look at the situation.\n\nThe author's daughter, who recently overcame depression, has been struggling with messiness. The father and mother-in-law brought up this issue in front of the daughter, criticizing her for not cleaning up and taking care of the cat. The daughter was upset, crying, and feeling like a \"piece of shit.\" The author intervened by yelling and telling them to fuck off. Now they're out of contact.\n\nFirst, the father and mother-in-law's actions: bringing up the daughter's messiness in a public setting where she's already vulnerable isn't helpful. The daughter is doing well after depression, and public criticism could trigger a relapse. The father not apologizing when the daughter was hurt adds to the problem. The mother-in-law joined in, escalating the situation.\n\nThe author's response was to defend their daughter, which is protective. While the language used (\"fuck off\") is harsh, the context is a daughter in emotional distress. The author's main concern is the daughter's mental health, which is valid. The father and mother-in-law's behavior might have been well-intentioned but poorly executed, but the way they handled the situation was hurtful.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? They acted out of concern to protect their daughter from further harm. However, using aggressive language might have been excessive. But considering the circumstances\u2014protecting a vulnerable family member from being criticized in a public way\u2014their actions are more in defense than aggression. The father and mother-in-law's actions are also problematic. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The answer is B.\n"
