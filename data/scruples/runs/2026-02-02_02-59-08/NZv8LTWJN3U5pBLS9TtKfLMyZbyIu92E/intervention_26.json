We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's daughter recovering from depression, moving in with them, and then facing criticism from her father and mother about her messiness and cat care. The author lost their temper and told her parents and husband to \"fuck off,\" which has caused a rift.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The daughter is in a vulnerable state, recently recovering from a serious relationship and depression. She's working hard, in school, and in therapy, which the husband is aware of. The parents and husband criticized her in front of her, which was hurtful. The author stepped in to protect her, which shows concern for her mental health.\n\nThe key points here are about respect and the appropriateness of the author's response. The husband and mother were not respecting the daughter's boundaries, especially in front of her. The author's outburst was a reaction to protect her daughter. While using strong language is understandable in the moment, the author's intention was to stop the harassment, which was harmful.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's method of responding might be seen as harsh. Yelling and using profanity could be considered disrespectful towards the husband and mother. However, the situation was emotionally charged, and the author was trying to defend their daughter. The alternative might have been to let the criticism continue, which could have worsened the daughter's mental health.\n\nConsidering the intent versus the action: the author acted out of love and concern. The wrongness would depend on whether the author's actions were justified given the circumstances. The husband and mother had no right to berate the daughter in front of her, especially given her history. The author's response, while strong, was a direct intervention to stop the harm.\n\nSo, while the author could have handled it differently, the core issue is the protection of a vulnerable family member from unjust criticism. The author's actions were a reaction to defend their daughter's mental health, which is a significant factor. Therefore, the author might not be in the wrong. But it's a nuanced situation where both sides have some responsibility. However, the main wrongdoers were the husband and mother for their public criticism. The author's response, though harsh, was a defensive action.\n"
