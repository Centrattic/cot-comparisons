We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author yelling at her mother and husband after they criticized her daughter in front of her, which led to the daughter having a breakdown.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author's daughter was coming back from depression and had a lot going on. The husband and mother criticized her in front of her, which upset the daughter. The author then lost her temper and told them to fuck off or else. Now, they haven't spoken since, and the author is questioning if she was wrong.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to consider both sides. On one hand, the author stood up for her daughter, which is a protective instinct. The daughter was vulnerable, and the criticism from family might have triggered her depression again. The author's reaction could be seen as defending her child, which is understandable.\n\nOn the other hand, yelling and using harsh language might not be the best approach. The author could have handled the situation differently, like addressing the issue privately without cursing. However, the context is important here\u2014her daughter was emotionally broken down, and the parents were publicly shaming her. The author's reaction was in the heat of the moment, possibly to protect her daughter's mental health.\n\nAlso, the husband didn't apologize when the daughter was upset, which might indicate he wasn't being supportive. The mother-in-law agreed with the criticism, adding to the daughter's distress. The author's outburst might be seen as justified because it was to prevent further harm to her daughter.\n\nBut then again, the author's method of handling it could have been better. However, the emotional state of the daughter is a crucial factor. The question is whether the author's actions were wrong. Since the daughter was at risk of relapsing, the author's intervention might be seen as necessary, even if the method was harsh.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, people often debate the balance between emotional reactions and consequences. The key is whether the author overstepped or acted in defense of her child. Considering the daughter's mental health was at stake, the author might be in the right for protecting her, even if the approach was unorthodox.\n"
