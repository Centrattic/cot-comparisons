We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about their daughter, who's 26 and has been through a tough time with depression. She's doing better now, working and going to school, but she's still a bit messy. The husband and mother talked about her mess in front of her, which upset her a lot. The author yelled at them, telling them to fuck off, and now they're not talking to each other.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The daughter is dealing with a lot, and her mental health is a factor. The husband and mother were criticizing her in front of her, which could be really hurtful, especially given her history. The author stepped in to protect her, which seems like a natural reaction when a loved one is being made to feel bad.\n\nBut did the author overreact? Yelling and using strong language might not be the best way to handle the situation. However, the emotional context is important. The daughter was crying and feeling like a \"piece of shit,\" which is serious. The author was trying to stop the emotional harm to their daughter. In that case, maybe the reaction, while harsh, was a result of protecting their child's mental health.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband and mother might have thought they were just giving constructive feedback, but bringing it up in front of the daughter without her consent was wrong. The author had to intervene because no one else was respecting the daughter's feelings. The question is whether the author's method of intervention was appropriate, but the intent was to protect their daughter, so maybe the answer is B, not in the wrong.\n"
