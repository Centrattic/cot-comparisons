We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong. The scenario involves a daughter with depression who's been making progress, but her father and mother-in-law are criticizing her in front of her, which causes her to break down. The author yells at them and tells them to \"fuck off,\" then takes her daughter to calm down. Now, the author is wondering if they were wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The daughter is dealing with a lot: a recent breakup, depression, starting a new job and school, and therapy. The messiness is noted as a change that started during her depression. The husband is frustrated, and the mother-in-law is siding with him. They bring this up in front of the daughter, which is clearly hurtful. The daughter is already vulnerable, and the public criticism likely exacerbated her feelings of being a failure.\n\nThe author's reaction is to lose their temper and confront the husband and mother. They were trying to protect their daughter's feelings. On one hand, yelling and using a strong phrase like \"fuck off\" might not be the best approach for resolving conflict. But on the other hand, the author's primary concern was their daughter's mental health. The daughter was on the verge of a breakdown, so the immediate action was to stop the harmful behavior.\n\nI need to evaluate if the author's actions were justified given the circumstances. The daughter's mental health is critical here. The parents' actions were contributing to her negative self-perception, which could be detrimental to her recovery. The author stepped in to stop the toxic environment, even if the method was harsh.\n\nHowever, there's also the aspect of communication. Yelling might not be the most effective way to handle the situation, especially in a family setting. But considering the urgency of protecting the daughter's emotional state, the author might have felt they had no choice. The question is whether the ends justify the means here.\n\nAlso, the author hasn't reached out to the husband or mother since, which could be seen as avoiding conflict, but maybe they're giving the family time to cool down. The author's main motivation seems to be protective of their daughter, which is a strong factor in determining right or wrong.\n\nIn terms of AITA (Am I the Asshole), the community often looks at intent and context. If the author's intent was to protect their daughter from further harm, that's a strong point in their favor. The husband and mother's actions were harmful, so the author's reaction, while strong, was a defense mechanism.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, I think the author is not in the wrong because their action was a direct response to prevent further harm to their daughter's mental health. Even though yelling isn't ideal, the context of the situation justifies the reaction. Therefore, the answer would be B (No).\n"
