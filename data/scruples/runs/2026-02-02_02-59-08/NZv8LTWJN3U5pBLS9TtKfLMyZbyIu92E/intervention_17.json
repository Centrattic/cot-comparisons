We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author yelling at their mother and husband after they criticized the daughter in front of her.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The daughter had a tough time with depression but is improving. She's working, going to school, and in therapy. The husband is annoyed by her messiness and brought it up in front of her, along with the mother. The daughter felt hurt, and the author lost their temper, telling them to \"fuck off.\"\n\nSo, the main issue here is public criticism of the daughter by the husband and mother, which led the author to react strongly. The question is whether the author was wrong for that reaction.\n\nOn one side, the husband and mother criticized the daughter in her presence, which is generally considered rude and harmful, especially given her mental health history. The author's reaction was to protect the daughter from further harm, which shows concern for her well-being. In that case, maybe the author isn't in the wrong because they were defending their child.\n\nOn the other hand, yelling and using harsh language could be seen as excessive. However, the context is that the daughter was already upset and the parents weren't apologizing. The author might have felt that a strong reaction was necessary to stop the hurtful behavior.\n\nBut some might argue that the author could have handled it in a calmer way, like addressing it privately or setting boundaries without the harsh language. However, considering the emotional state of the daughter and the immediate need to protect her, the reaction might be justified.\n\nI also need to consider cultural norms and typical responses to such situations. In many cases, protecting a child from public humiliation is seen as a parent's duty. The husband and mother's actions were the initial problem, so the author's outburst might be a reaction to their failure to support the daughter.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's main fault might not be in the outburst itself, but in the method. However, given the circumstances, it's a protective measure. Therefore, the answer might be B (the author is not in the wrong) because they were defending their daughter from harmful criticism.\n"
