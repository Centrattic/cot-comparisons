We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author's daughter is recovering from depression, which is a big deal. She's working, going to school, and therapy\u2014all positive steps. The husband is annoyed by her messiness, which is understandable, but bringing it up in front of her is problematic. The mother-in-law agrees and they both criticize her, even mentioning her cat. This makes the daughter cry and feel bad about herself. The author loses her temper and tells them off, then takes the daughter to calm down. Now, the family is upset, and the author is unsure if they're in the wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are the daughter's mental health and the public criticism by the husband and mother-in-law. The daughter is in a vulnerable position, and the criticism could set her back. The author's reaction is a defense of their daughter's well-being. While yelling might not be the best approach, the intent was to protect the daughter from harmful comments. The husband and mother-in-law's actions were the initial problem. The author's actions were a response to protect their child. So, maybe the author isn't in the wrong because they were defending their daughter's mental health. But some might argue that the author could have handled it differently. However, the main issue is the public shaming by the husband and mother-in-law. The answer would likely be B (not in the wrong) because they were standing up for their daughter's well-being.\n"
