We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe main conflict is between the daughter (age 26) and her parents. The daughter has a history of depression but has been doing much better\u2014job, school, therapy. The father and mother-in-law criticize her messiness and cat care in front of her, leading her to feel bad and cry. The author (the mother) steps in and yells at her husband and mother-in-law, telling them to fuck off if they're not going to be respectful. Now they're all upset, and she's wondering if she's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the father and mother-in-law made the daughter feel ashamed in front of others, which is a serious issue. They were being critical and not supportive when she was already vulnerable. The daughter had a lot on her plate, so cutting her some slack makes sense. The author's reaction was a defense of her daughter's dignity. \n\nBut did she overreact? The language she used (\"fuck off\") might be seen as harsh, but given the emotional context, maybe the intent was to protect her daughter from further harm. The key here is the daughter's mental health. If the father and mother-in-law's comments could set her back, then the author's action was in her best interest.\n\nHowever, yelling and using strong language could be seen as inappropriate. But the alternative was letting the criticism continue, which might have been worse for the daughter. The question is whether the method was justified by the intent. \n\nSince the daughter's mental health is at stake, and the parents were being unsupportive, the author's action was a protective measure. So the answer would likely be B (No), the author is not in the wrong because she was standing up for her daughter's well-being.\n"
