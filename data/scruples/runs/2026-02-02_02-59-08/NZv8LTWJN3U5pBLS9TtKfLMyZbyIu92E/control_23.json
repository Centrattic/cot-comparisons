We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole?) story is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe person is a mother who got angry at her husband and mother for criticizing their daughter in front of her. The daughter had recently come out of a bad situation, is dealing with depression, but is now doing better with a job, school, and therapy. The husband is annoyed by her messiness, and the mother-in-law agreed, leading to them berating the daughter in front of her. The daughter was upset and cried, feeling like a \"piece of shit.\" The mother then lost her temper and told them to fuck off. Now, she's questioning if she was wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the context. The daughter is in a sensitive state, recovering from depression. Public criticism in front of her from family members could be harmful. The mother tried to defend her daughter, which shows she's trying to protect her mental health. The husband didn't apologize when the daughter was hurt, and the mother-in-law continued the criticism. \n\nThe mother's outburst was a reaction to protecting her daughter from hurtful remarks. While the language used was harsh (\"fuck off\"), the intent was to stop the negativity towards her daughter. The daughter's mental health is a priority here. The mother's actions were a last resort after seeing her daughter emotionally damaged.\n\nOn the other hand, the mother didn't approach the situation calmly first. She could have addressed it with her husband and mother privately, but instead, she exploded. However, given the emotional state of her daughter and the public nature of the criticism, her reaction might be understandable.\n\nThe key points are: the daughter's well-being, the public shaming, and the mother's intent to protect. The husband and mother-in-law's behavior was inappropriate. The mother's reaction, while harsh in words, was a response to protect her daughter. So, the mother isn't necessarily in the wrong. The AITA usually considers the intent and context. Here, the mother's intent was positive, even if the method was not ideal. However, the story might lean towards the mother not being in the wrong because she stood up for her daughter against harmful comments. So the answer is B (No).\n"
