We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The scenario involves a daughter who's overcoming depression, and the parents and mother-in-law are criticizing her in front of her, leading the mother to lose her temper.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The daughter has been doing well after moving in, getting a job, going to school, and therapy. Her messiness is a recent issue, possibly from her depression. The husband and mother-in-law criticized her in front of her, which upset her. The mother then yelled at them, telling them to be respectful or \"fuck off.\" The mother hasn't spoken to them since and is conflicted about it.\n\nThe main question is whether the mother overreacted. On one hand, public criticism can be hurtful, especially for someone with a history of depression. The mother might have felt protective, wanting to shield her daughter from negative comments that could trigger a relapse. Her actions were a direct response to protect her child's mental health, which is a valid concern.\n\nOn the other hand, yelling and using harsh language like \"fuck off\" might be seen as impolite or escalating the situation. However, the context is important. The mother had a history of a generally loving relationship with her husband and mother-in-law, so this was a significant breach of their usual dynamics. The key here is that the initial criticism came from the husband and mother-in-law in front of the daughter, which was inappropriate. The mother's outburst was a reaction to protect her daughter's feelings, which might be justified given the daughter's mental health history.\n\nIn terms of accountability, the husband and mother-in-law were at fault for their public criticism. The mother's response was a stand against their behavior. While the method was aggressive, the intent was protective. Therefore, the mother isn't necessarily in the wrong. The answer would likely be B (No), as her actions were a justified reaction to protect her daughter's well-being.\n"
