We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author's daughter moved back in after a tough breakup and has been working hard to improve her life, including a job, school, and therapy. The husband is annoyed by her messiness, and the mother-in-law agrees. They discussed this in front of the daughter, leading to her crying. The author then lost her temper and told them to \"fuck off\" and left with her daughter. Now, the family isn't talking, and the author is questioning if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, let's look at the key points. The daughter is making significant progress, which the author and husband know. The parents are criticizing her for something that's a current issue (messiness) but the daughter is already handling a lot. The criticism was public, which can be really hurtful. The daughter's reaction was emotional, indicating that the comments affected her deeply. The author tried to console her but the parents continued, leading to the outburst.\n\nThe author's action was yelling and telling them to \"fuck off.\" While that's strong language, it came after the parents kept berating the daughter. The daughter's mental health is a concern, and the author is trying to protect her. However, using such harsh language might be seen as inappropriate, even if the intent was to stop the bullying.\n\nBut the parents were in the wrong for attacking the daughter in front of them, especially given her history with depression. The husband didn't apologize, which is a red flag. The author's outburst, while unorthodox, was a reaction to the parents' harmful behavior. The question is whether the author's response was justified or if they should have handled it more calmly.\n\nOn one hand, yelling and using harsh language isn't ideal in such situations. It might have escalated tensions and made things worse. On the other hand, the parents' actions were clearly harmful, and the author was trying to protect their daughter from further mental health decline. The author's approach was emotional, but the intent was protective.\n\nConsidering the context, the main issue is the parents' public criticism of the daughter, not the author's response. The author's actions were a reaction to protect their daughter. While the words used were harsh, the underlying motivation was to stop the bullying. So, maybe the author isn't in the wrong because they were defending their daughter's well-being. However, could they have handled it better? Probably, but the question is about being in the wrong, not the best possible action.\n\nIn the AITA context, the community often considers intentions and the broader context. The parents were at fault, and the author's outburst was a result of that. So, the answer might be B (Not in the wrong) because the author was protecting their daughter from harmful criticism, even if the method was extreme.\n"
