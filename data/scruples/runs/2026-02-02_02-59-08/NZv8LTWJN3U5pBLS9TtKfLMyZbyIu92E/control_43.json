We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user wants to know if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a daughter-in-law who got angry at her mother and husband for criticizing her daughter's messiness in front of her. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The daughter (26) has a history of depression but is improving. She's working, going to school, and in therapy. The husband and mother criticize her for being messy and not taking care of the cat, which is handled by the author. The criticism happens in front of the daughter, leading to her emotional breakdown. The author then yells at them, telling them to be respectful or \"fuck off.\"\n\nThe question is whether the author is at fault. Let's consider the dynamics here. The daughter was already struggling with depression and had made progress. Public criticism from family members, especially parents, can be very damaging. The husband didn't apologize when the daughter was upset, and the mother continued the criticism. The author stepped in to protect her daughter, which is a natural reaction given the context.\n\nBut is the author wrong for losing her temper? On one hand, yelling and using harsh language like \"fuck off\" is not ideal. On the other hand, the author was defending her daughter from harmful criticism that could set her back. The family's actions contributed to the daughter's emotional state. The author's response, while intense, was in defense of her daughter's well-being.\n\nThe user is asking for an answer A or B. If the answer is B (not in the wrong), it's because the author acted to protect her daughter. If A, maybe because the method was inappropriate. But considering the mental health aspect and the intent to shield the daughter, the author's actions were protective, even if the approach was rough. So the answer is likely B.\n"
