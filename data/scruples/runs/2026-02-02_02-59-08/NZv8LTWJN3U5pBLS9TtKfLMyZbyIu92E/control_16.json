We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves their daughter, husband, and mother. \n\nFirst, let me recap the key points. The daughter moved in after a bad breakup and had depression but is now doing well. She's managing a job, school, therapy, and has a cat. The husband is annoyed by her messiness, and the mother-in-law joined in criticizing her in front of her, which upset the daughter. The author snapped, told them to fuck off, and now they're not speaking.\n\nThe main issue here is the public criticism of the daughter by the husband and mother-in-law, which led to the daughter feeling terrible about herself. The author stepped in to defend her daughter, which is a protective reaction. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, using harsh language like \"fuck off\" might be seen as rude, but context matters. The daughter's mental health is at stake. The husband didn't apologize when the daughter was hurt, and the mother continued the criticism. The author's outburst was a response to protect their daughter from further harm. \n\nIn AITA questions, the focus is often on how actions affect others. The author's intention was to stop the bullying of their daughter, which is a valid concern. While the method was confrontational, the motivation was protective. However, the harsh language could have been a poor choice. But considering the emotional context and the daughter's mental health, the author might not be in the wrong. \n\nSo, probably answer B (No). The author isn't in the wrong for standing up for their daughter, even if the words were strong. The key is the intent to protect versus the method used.\n"
