We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for yelling at their mother and husband after they criticized their daughter in front of her.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The daughter was coming back from depression and had made a lot of progress. She's working, in school, in therapy. So she's under a lot of stress. The daughter's messiness is an issue, but the parents are being critical in front of her. The husband was venting to the mother about the daughter's habits, and they were being harsh, even bringing up the cat's litter box. The daughter ends up crying and feeling bad about herself. The author steps in, yells at them to stop or leave, then takes the daughter to calm down. Now the author is wondering if they were wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the daughter's mental health, the public criticism from parents, the emotional harm caused, and the author's reaction. The author's primary concern seems to be protecting their daughter's well-being. They felt that the criticism from husband and mother was undermining the daughter's progress. The author's outburst was in defense of their daughter.\n\nBut was the author in the wrong? Well, reacting by yelling and telling them to \"fuck off\" is strong, but it's in the context of defending a vulnerable family member. The parents (husband and mother) were in the wrong for criticizing the daughter publicly, especially given her mental health. The author's action, while harsh, was a reaction to protect their daughter's feelings. However, the author might have handled it differently, like addressing the issue privately. But given the emotional state of the daughter and the public shaming, the reaction could be justified. \n\nOn the other hand, using harsh language might not be the best approach, but the intent was to stop the hurtful behavior. The author acknowledges feeling bad about losing their temper but stands by the action to protect their daughter. So, considering the context, the author might not be in the wrong because they were trying to protect their daughter from emotional harm. The husband and mother's actions were the initial problem. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
