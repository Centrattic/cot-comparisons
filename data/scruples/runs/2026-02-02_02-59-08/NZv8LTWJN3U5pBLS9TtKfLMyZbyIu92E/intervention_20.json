We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves a daughter who's recovering from depression, and the parents and mother-in-law are criticizing her messiness in front of her. The author, who is the mother, lost her temper and told her mother-in-law and husband to \"fuck off\" when they continued to berate their daughter. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The daughter has a lot on her plate: a new job, going back to school, therapy. The mother is supportive, cutting her daughter some slack. The husband is upset about the mess, and the mother-in-law agrees with him. They bring it up in front of the daughter, who is already emotionally vulnerable. The daughter gets upset, says she's a \"piece of shit,\" and the parents and mother-in-law keep going. The author intervenes and yells at them.\n\nSo, the key points here are: 1) The daughter's mental health is at stake. 2) The parents and mother-in-law are publicly shaming her in a sensitive moment. 3) The author's reaction is a direct response to protect her daughter. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, using harsh language like \"fuck off\" is certainly confrontational and might be seen as inappropriate. But on the other hand, the daughter's emotional state is being harmed by the criticism, and the author is acting to defend her. The husband didn't apologize when the daughter was hurt, and the mother-in-law kept attacking after the daughter was upset. \n\nThe author's actions were a reaction to protect her child's mental health. While the method (yelling and using strong language) might be seen as extreme, the underlying motivation seems to be protective. In such cases, people often prioritize their child's well-being over social niceties. \n\nHowever, there's a balance. Parents should communicate their concerns in a respectful way, especially in front of their child. But the daughter here was already struggling, and the criticism was happening in a public, hurtful way. The author's outburst might have been a last resort. \n\nI think the key here is the intent and the context. The author's intent was to protect her daughter from further harm. While the manner was harsh, the situation might justify it. So, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong). But I need to make sure there's no other angle. Maybe the author could have addressed the situation without using such language, but given the emotional state of the daughter and the continued criticism from the other two, the reaction might be understandable. \n\nSo, I'm leaning towards B.\n"
