We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for yelling at her mother and husband after they criticized her daughter.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The daughter is 26, has depression, moved in with them, and has been making progress. The husband and mother criticized her messiness and cat care in front of her. The daughter was upset, and the author lost her temper, telling them to \"fuck off.\"\n\nSo, the key points here are: the daughter is vulnerable with mental health issues, the parents' public criticism might have triggered a setback, and the author acted to protect her. But did she go too far?\n\nOn one hand, the author's outburst was directed at her mother and husband, which is serious. Using such strong language might be seen as inappropriate, especially in a family context. However, the motivation was to defend her daughter's emotional well-being. \n\nThe husband didn't apologize, and the mother continued the criticism. The daughter's self-esteem was at stake. The author's actions were a response to protect her child from harmful comments. But yelling and using harsh language could have been handled differently.\n\nIs the author wrong? It depends on perspective. She might be justified in her frustration, but the method of response could be questioned. However, given the emotional stakes and the daughter's mental health, her actions might be seen as a necessary stand against bullying. Alternatively, she could be seen as overreacting. \n\nBut in the context of protecting a vulnerable family member from verbal abuse, even if the method was harsh, the intent might be considered valid. So, maybe B (not in the wrong). But if the focus is on the appropriateness of the response, then A (in the wrong). Hmm. The question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The answer might hinge on intent versus method. Since the intent was protective, but the method was harsh, there's a balance. However, in AITA scenarios, people often consider the context of mental health and family dynamics. \n\nI think the author's actions are justified because protecting her daughter's mental health is crucial, and the criticism from family members was harmful. The outburst was a reaction to protect her child, so B (not in the wrong).\n"
