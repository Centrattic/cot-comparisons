We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So, the user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation carefully.\n\nThe author has a daughter who's recovering from depression and has a lot going on: a new job, school, therapy. The daughter used to be a slob, but that's part of her past struggles. The husband is annoyed by her messiness, and the mother-in-law agrees with him. They talk about it in front of the daughter, even bringing up her cat and the fact that the author is the one cleaning the litter box. The daughter gets upset, says she's a piece of shit, and the husband doesn't apologize. The author then yells at her husband and mother-in-law, telling them to be respectful or else. The daughter was crying, and the author took her to get food. Now the family is upset with the author.\n\nHmm. So the key points here: The daughter is in a sensitive position, recovering from depression. Public criticism from parents and in-laws could be harmful. The husband didn't apologize when his venting hurt the daughter. The mother-in-law joined in the criticism. The author stepped in to protect the daughter's mental health, which is crucial.\n\nIs the author in the wrong for yelling? Well, they were defending their daughter. But maybe there's a better way to handle it. However, considering the daughter's mental state, the author's reaction might be justified. The husband and mother-in-law were being unkind in front of her, which could set back her recovery. The author's outburst stopped the hurtful comments and supported the daughter. \n\nBut maybe the author could have handled it without yelling. But in the moment, when the daughter is sobbing and internalizing the criticism, the author's anger might be a reaction to protect. The question is whether the method (yelling \"fuck off\") was wrong. In some contexts, that's a strong reaction, but given the circumstances, it's understandable. \n\nSo, the author's actions were to protect their daughter's mental health. The husband and mother-in-law were contributing to a harmful environment. The author might not be in the wrong because they were trying to shield their daughter from further harm. The answer might be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
