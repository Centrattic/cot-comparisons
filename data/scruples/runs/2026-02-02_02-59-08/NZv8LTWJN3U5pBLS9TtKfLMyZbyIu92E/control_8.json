We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a daughter with depression who's recovering, and her parents and mother-in-law criticized her in front of her, leading to a confrontation.\n\nFirst, the daughter has been through a lot. She left a bad relationship, moved in with her parents, and is now working and going to school. She's making progress, which is good. The issue is her messiness. The husband is frustrated, and the mother agrees, leading to them berating the daughter in front of her. The daughter gets emotional, and the mother-in-law joins in. The author, the mother, steps in and yells at them, telling them to back off or leave. Then she takes the daughter out to calm down.\n\nFrom the story, the author is defending her daughter against criticism from her husband and mother-in-law. The daughter is vulnerable because of her mental health history. The parents are pointing out the daughter's flaws publicly, which the author sees as harmful. The author's reaction is to protect her daughter, even if it means being harsh with her husband and mother.\n\nIs the author wrong? Well, the daughter is in a sensitive state. The parents' criticism could indeed set her back. The author's outburst is a reaction to protect her daughter's mental health. However, the author did use harsh language (\"fuck off\"), which is unkind, but the intent was to stop the bullying. The husband didn't apologize, so maybe the problem wasn't entirely the daughter's. The mother and husband's actions might have been the root issue here. The author's actions, while not the most diplomatic, were protective. So, the answer is likely B (not in the wrong), because the author was defending her daughter from harmful criticism.\n"
