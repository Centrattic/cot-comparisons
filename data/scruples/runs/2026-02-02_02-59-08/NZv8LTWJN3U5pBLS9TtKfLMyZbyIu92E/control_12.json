We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about the user's daughter who's dealing with depression and has moved in with them. The daughter is doing better, has a job, school, therapy, etc. But she's a bit messy, which is a point of contention between her and the husband. The mother and husband then talk about this in front of the daughter, leading to her emotional breakdown. The author then yells at both of them, telling them to fuck off or respect her daughter.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The daughter is in a vulnerable state, recently out of a bad relationship, dealing with depression. The parents are criticizing her in front of her, specifically about things that might be a result of her past depression. The mother and husband aren't being supportive here. The author intervened because they saw their daughter's mental health suffering, which is a valid concern.\n\nNow, the author's response was to lose their temper and use strong language. That's where the question of whether they were in the wrong comes in. On one hand, they stood up for their daughter, which is commendable. On the other, the method was aggressive and might have been disrespectful to their mother and husband. However, the context is that the daughter was being made to feel bad by people she trusts, leading to her saying she's a piece of shit. The author's outburst might be seen as a reaction to protect their child's mental health.\n\nBut is yelling and using profanity the right way to handle it? Maybe not, but the emotional context is intense. The key is whether the author's actions were justified given the situation. They were trying to protect their daughter from harmful criticism at a time when her mental health is crucial. The husband not apologizing adds to the tension. The mother and husband were both involved in berating the daughter, which is the root issue here. The author's reaction, while perhaps not the best approach, was a response to protect their child. So maybe they're not in the wrong. \n\nHowever, some might argue that the author should have handled it more calmly, even if the situation was bad. But considering the daughter's emotional state and the fact that the parents weren't being supportive, the author's actions could be seen as necessary. So the answer might be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
