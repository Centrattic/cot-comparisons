We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation revolves around a conflict between the author, her mother, husband, and daughter. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The daughter has depression and has been making progress. She moved in with her parents, and while she's doing well in therapy and school, she's a bit messy. The husband is upset about this, and during a visit from the mother, they both berated the daughter in front of her, leading the author to lose her temper and tell them to fuck off.\n\nThe author's main argument is that she was protecting her daughter's mental health. The daughter was already struggling, and having her parents criticize her publicly could set her back. The author intervened when the emotional harm was happening. \n\nOn the other hand, yelling and using strong language like \"fuck off\" might be seen as inappropriate, even if the intent was good. However, the context is crucial here. The daughter was in a vulnerable state, crying, and internalizing the criticism. The parents' behavior was unkind and dismissive, especially in front of her. The author stepped in to defend her daughter, which is a form of advocacy. \n\nI need to consider whether the author's action was justified. While the method (yelling and harsh language) isn't ideal, the underlying reason\u2014protecting a loved one from emotional harm\u2014might be seen as more important. In such cases, people often prioritize stopping immediate harm over maintaining politeness. \n\nAlso, the husband didn't apologize, and the mother continued the criticism, which likely escalated the situation. The author's outburst was a reaction to their collective disregard for the daughter's feelings. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the author's action, though harsh, was in response to a harmful situation. The blame here might lie more with the husband and mother for their unkind remarks in the first place. The author is defending her daughter's well-being, which is a valid reason. Therefore, the answer is probably B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
