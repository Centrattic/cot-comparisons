We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. So, the situation is about their daughter who's recovering from depression. The daughter moved in with them and has been doing well\u2014getting a job, going to school, therapy. But she's a bit messy now, which the husband is annoyed about. The mother and husband then comment on this in front of the daughter, even bringing up her cat's litter box, which the author is the one cleaning. The daughter gets upset, says she's a piece of shit, and the husband doesn't apologize. Then the author yells at both the mother and husband, telling them to fuck off or they can have dinner alone. Now they're all not talking, and the author is questioning if they're in the wrong.\n\nHmm. First, the daughter is in a fragile mental state, so public criticism from family could be really harmful. The parents (husband and mother) brought up the topic in front of her, which was probably not considerate. The husband didn't apologize when she was crying, which is not supportive. The author tried to console the daughter but then the mother and husband kept going. The author lashing out in that moment was a reaction to protect their daughter's feelings. \n\nBut is yelling and saying \"fuck off\" acceptable? Well, the context is important. The daughter's mental health is a priority here. The husband and mother's actions might have been contributing to her stress. The author's outburst was in defense of the daughter. However, using such strong language might have been unhelpful for resolving the conflict. But considering the emotional state of the daughter and the situation, maybe the author did what they had to do to protect her. \n\nOn the other hand, the author could have handled it differently, like removing the daughter from the conversation first or addressing the issue privately with the husband and mother. But given the immediate emotional impact on the daughter, the author's reaction might be seen as justified. The key points are the daughter's vulnerability and the public criticism from the family members. The author's action was a response to prevent further harm, even if the method was harsh. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because they were protecting their daughter's mental health. The husband and mother's behavior was the root issue here. So the answer would be B, No.\n"
