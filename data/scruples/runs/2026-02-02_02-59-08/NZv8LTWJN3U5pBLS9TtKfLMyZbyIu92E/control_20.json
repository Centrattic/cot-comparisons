We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe user is asking if the author is in the wrong (AITA) for telling her mother and husband to \"fuck off\" after they criticized her daughter in front of her. The background is that the daughter, who was recovering from depression and has been doing well, was being judged for being messy and not taking care of the cat. The husband and mother were arguing about this in front of the daughter, leading her to cry and feel like a \"piece of shit.\" The author intervened, lost her temper, and told them to fuck off or leave. Now, the mother and husband haven't spoken to her since, and she's feeling bad but also concerned about her daughter's mental health.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The daughter is in a vulnerable state, recovering from depression and taking big steps to improve her life. Public criticism from family members can be really damaging, especially for someone with a history of mental health issues. The author's husband and mother were berating the daughter in front of her, which is likely contributing to her negative self-image. The author intervened to protect her daughter, which seems like a protective instinct. \n\nHowever, the method of intervention was to yell and use a strong expletive. While the intention was to defend her daughter, the approach might be seen as aggressive. The key points here are whether the criticism was justified and if there was a better way to handle the situation without escalating it.\n\nThe husband's frustration with the daughter's messiness could be a valid concern, but addressing it in front of her and making her feel bad about the cat might not be the right approach. The mother's agreement and the public shaming exacerbate the problem. The author's outburst was a reaction to protect her daughter's feelings, which is understandable given the daughter's history.\n\nOn the other hand, using harsh language might not be the most effective way to resolve the issue. It could lead to further conflict and damage family relationships. The author might need to address the situation calmly with her husband and mother to prevent such incidents in the future, but in the moment, her reaction was driven by a desire to protect her daughter from emotional harm.\n\nIn terms of accountability, the husband and mother are at fault for their public criticism, which contributed to the daughter's emotional breakdown. The author's action was a response to that, so while the method was harsh, the underlying motivation was protective. Therefore, the author might not be in the wrong, but there's room for reflection on how to handle such situations better next time without losing temper. The key is balancing the daughter's need for support against the family's concerns.\n"
