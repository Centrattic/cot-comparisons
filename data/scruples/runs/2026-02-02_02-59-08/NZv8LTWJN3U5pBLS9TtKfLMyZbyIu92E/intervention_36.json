We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author's mother and husband criticized their daughter in front of her, which led to the daughter feeling terrible. The daughter is already dealing with depression and has made progress, so public criticism might be harmful. The parents' conversation was in front of the daughter, which is unkind. The author lost their temper and told them to \"fuck off\" or leave, then took the daughter out. \n\nNow, considering the context: The daughter is in a vulnerable state. Publicly berating someone with depression can set back their recovery. The husband and mother's actions might have been hurtful, even if their intention was to express their frustration. The author intervened to protect their daughter's mental health. \n\nBut the author used harsh language. While the intent was to protect their daughter, yelling and using a vulgar phrase might not be the best approach. However, given the emotional stakes and the daughter's mental health, some might argue it's understandable. The key is whether the author's actions were disproportionate. \n\nOn one hand, the parents' criticism was unkind and public. On the other, the author's response was aggressive. But the author's goal was to defend their child, which is a strong justification. The aftermath shows that the author is now feeling bad about their outburst, indicating they see it as wrong in some way.\n\nSo, weighing the intent (protecting a vulnerable child) against the method (harsh words), it's a bit of a toss-up. Some might say the method was wrong, but the intent was right. Others might prioritize the intent. In AITA contexts, the community often considers both the action and the context. Since the parents were in the wrong for their treatment of the daughter, the author's reaction is seen as a justified stand-up for their child, even if the words were harsh.\n\nTherefore, the author might not be in the wrong because their action was driven by a desire to protect their daughter from further harm. The harsh language is a negative, but in the context of defending someone with mental health issues, it could be seen as a necessary reaction.\n"
