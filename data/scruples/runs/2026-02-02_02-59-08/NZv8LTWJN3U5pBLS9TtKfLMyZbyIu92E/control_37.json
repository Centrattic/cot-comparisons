We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author snapping at her mother and husband after they criticized her daughter in front of her.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The daughter is 26, recovering from depression, has a lot going on\u2014working full-time, in school, and in therapy. The husband and mother criticized her for being messy and not taking care of the cat, which upset the daughter. The author lost her temper and told them to fuck off or be respectful. Now they're not speaking to her, and she's wondering if she was wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here: the daughter's mental health is fragile. Public criticism from family can have a negative impact. The mother and husband's comments were in front of the daughter, which is part of the problem. The author stepped in to defend her daughter, which is a protective instinct. But she used harsh language (\"fuck off\") which is strong. \n\nOn one hand, defending a family member who's vulnerable might be justified. On the other hand, the author used a strong swear word, which could be seen as rude or disrespectful. But considering the context\u2014her daughter was being criticized and it affected her mental health\u2014her reaction might be understandable as a defense mechanism.\n\nThe community often considers the intent and the context. The author's intent was to protect her daughter. The mother and husband were being critical in a way that could harm the daughter's recovery. The author's outburst was a direct response to that, which might be seen as a reasonable reaction given the circumstances.\n\nAlso, the daughter was already feeling bad, and the parents' criticism might not have been constructive. The author's approach, while direct, was to stop the negative conversation. In AITA scenarios, if someone stands up for a vulnerable family member, they're often seen as not the asshole. However, the use of strong language could be a point against them. But the overall situation shows that the author acted to protect her daughter's feelings and mental health, which is a valid concern.\n\nSo, balancing the use of harsh language against the intent to protect, the community might lean towards the author not being in the wrong. The answer would likely be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
