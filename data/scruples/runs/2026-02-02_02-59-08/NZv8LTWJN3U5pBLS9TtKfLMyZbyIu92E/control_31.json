We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves their daughter moving in after a breakup and depression, then a conflict arises when the daughter's messiness is criticized by the husband and mother-in-law in front of her. The author lost their temper and told them to \"fuck off,\" leading to a rift.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The daughter was in a difficult situation, overcoming depression, working, and going to school. Her parents and mother-in-law criticized her in front of her, which was hurtful. The husband didn't apologize, and the mother continued. The author stepped in to protect their daughter, which is a natural reaction to defend a vulnerable family member. \n\nThe question is whether the author was wrong to react this way. The key points here are the intent and the proportionality of the response. The author's goal was to protect their daughter's mental health, which is valid. However, using such strong language might be seen as overreacting. But given the emotional context and the daughter's state, maybe it's understandable.\n\nAlso, the author hasn't reached out to reconcile yet, but they do feel bad about it. The main issue is whether the criticism from the husband and mother was justified. Since the daughter was already struggling and the criticism was in front of her, that's likely hurtful. The author's intervention was to stop the bullying, so maybe they were in the right. \n\nOn the other side, using \"fuck off\" is harsh, but it's a common expression when someone is angry. The severity of the situation with the daughter's mental health might justify the strong reaction. The husband and mother were being disrespectful, so the author's response was to protect their child. \n\nIn terms of social norms, sometimes people do get upset when family members are disrespected, especially when it affects someone's mental health. So the answer might lean towards B, the author is not in the wrong. But I need to check if there's a cultural factor or if the language is too extreme. However, given the context of protecting a vulnerable daughter, it's a defense mechanism. The author's actions were to stop further harm, so they might not be in the wrong.\n"
