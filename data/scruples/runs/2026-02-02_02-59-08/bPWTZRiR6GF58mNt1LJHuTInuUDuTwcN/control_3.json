We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for not telling her mom she's pregnant. The author has a complicated relationship with her family. She ran away two years ago because of a controlling and abusive environment. The family is very religious, controlling, and she left for her own well-being. Now she's 37 weeks pregnant, hasn't told her family, and is conflicted about whether she should.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The family wasn't supportive when she was there, so leaving was necessary. The author hasn't had contact except for occasional texts that turn into arguments. She's worried about how they'd react to her pregnancy, especially being unmarried and the potential harm to her child. \n\nThe key points are the history of abuse, lack of communication, and the author's valid fears about her family's reaction. From an ethical standpoint, the mother's well-being and the child's safety are primary. The family's disapproval isn't a strong enough reason to force contact if it's harmful. The author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing her safety and her child's. Also, the question is whether she's in the wrong for not telling. Since she's not in a healthy relationship with them, not informing them isn't a mistake. The answer should be B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
