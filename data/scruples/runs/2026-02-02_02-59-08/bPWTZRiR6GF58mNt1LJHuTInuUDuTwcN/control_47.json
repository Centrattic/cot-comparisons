We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for not telling their mom about being pregnant.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author is 37 weeks pregnant and hasn't told their biological family. They have a strained relationship with their family, especially their mom, who is described as controlling and narcissistic. The family is religious and controlling, even to the point of invading the author's privacy. The author left home at 20 due to abuse and has built a stable life with a partner now.\n\nThe main points here are the family's behavior towards the author. The author hasn't been in contact except for rare texts where the family ends up screaming. The fear is that the family would react negatively, criticize the author for being unmarried and pregnant, and potentially harm the child. The author is struggling with guilt but also fear of the family's reaction.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key factors are the family's role in the author's life. The author has a history of abuse and control. The family isn't supportive, and communication is hostile. The decision not to tell them might be a protective measure for both the author and the baby. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, if the family isn't part of the author's life in a supportive way, the author isn't obligated to include them. The author's well-being and the child's safety are priorities. The family's potential negative reaction and history of abuse could justify not telling them. The author isn't hiding the pregnancy from an active relationship but from a family that's not engaged in a healthy way.\n\nSo, the answer is B (No), the author is not in the wrong. They have valid reasons based on their past experiences and the current state of the relationship. The guilt comes from societal expectations, but in this context, self-preservation and the child's welfare are more important.\n"
