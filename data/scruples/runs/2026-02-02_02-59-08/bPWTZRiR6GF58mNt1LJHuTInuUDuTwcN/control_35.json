We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not telling her mom she's pregnant. The situation is pretty complex, so I need to break it down.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that her family is extremely controlling and abusive. She ran away at 20 due to a narcissistic mother and a grandfather who runs the family like a cult. They controlled her life, invaded her privacy, etc. She's now 37 weeks pregnant, in a stable relationship, and hasn't told any of her biological family. The boyfriend hasn't pressured her to tell them. The author is scared of their reaction, thinking they'll call her names, criticize her for being unmarried, and that they might harm her child's life. She's conflicted between guilt and fear.\n\nSo, the main question is whether she's in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). I need to consider ethical perspectives here. From a typical family expectations standpoint, one might say that children should inform their parents about significant life events like a pregnancy. However, the context here is crucial. The family has a history of abuse and control. The author hasn't had contact with them except for occasional hostile messages. She left due to abuse, so maintaining contact isn't exactly healthy or safe.\n\nThe key points here are the family's behavior. If they are abusive, then the author isn't in the wrong for protecting herself and her child. The guilt she feels might be from societal norms, but in a harmful environment, it's actually responsible to cut off contact. The question is whether she's obligated to inform them. Legally, parents might have certain rights, but if the relationship is estranged and harmful, those rights might not be enforceable. Ethically, she's prioritizing her safety and her child's well-being. The fear of their reaction and potential harm to the child supports her decision. Also, the fact that they haven't spoken for a long time, and any communication is hostile, means that her not telling them isn't a matter of hiding but protecting herself from known abusers.\n\nTherefore, considering the family's toxic behavior, the author's actions are justified. She's not in the wrong for not informing them. The answer should be B (No).\n"
