We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong for not telling her mom about being pregnant. The situation is that she's 37 weeks pregnant, hasn't told her family, and they have a very strained relationship. The family is described as controlling and abusive, with a narcissistic mother and a grandfather who runs the family like a cult. She ran away two years ago because of their controlling behavior.\n\nSo, the key points here are the nature of the family relationship and the potential consequences of telling them. The author is in a situation where she's not in regular contact with her family, and when they do speak, it's confrontational. The family's history is abusive, which adds a layer of complexity. \n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong for not informing them. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to consider if there's an obligation to inform family members about such a significant life event. Typically, people might expect to share news of a pregnancy with their family. However, this is complicated by the fact that the family is unsupportive and potentially harmful. If sharing the news could lead to abuse or further conflict, then the decision to withhold it might be understandable.\n\nThe author is also concerned about her child's future exposure to the family's behavior. She doesn't want her child to experience the same treatment she did. This is a valid concern, especially if the family's behavior is toxic. The well-being of the child is a significant factor here.\n\nAnother angle: the author hasn't been in contact with her family except for occasional negative interactions. If they haven't maintained a relationship, does she have a responsibility to reach out? Some might argue that even in difficult relationships, you have a duty to inform them, but others might say that if the relationship is estranged and harmful, it's reasonable to prioritize safety and mental health.\n\nAlso, the boyfriend hasn't pressured her to tell the family, which suggests that the decision is primarily hers. She's feeling guilt, but the guilt might be more about the social expectation rather than any concrete wrongdoings. \n\nIn terms of ethical perspectives, the principle of autonomy is important here. The author is making a choice based on her own experiences and what she believes is best for herself and her child. If the family's reaction would be harmful, then her decision is a form of self-preservation and protection.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that cutting off communication entirely could be seen as avoiding responsibility or not being honest. But given the context of abuse and control, this seems like a protective measure rather than a deceitful action.\n\nI think the consensus would lean towards B (not in the wrong) because the decision is made in the context of a harmful family environment. The author is prioritizing her well-being and her child's safety, which are valid reasons. There's no obligation to put oneself in a vulnerable position if the other party is known to be abusive. The guilt she feels is likely societal pressure, but her circumstances justify her choice.\n"
