I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong for not telling her mom about the pregnancy. \n\nFirst, the situation: the user is 37 weeks pregnant and hasn't told her biological family. The family isn't on speaking terms except for rare texts where they end up screaming. The user ran away at 20 due to controlling and abusive parents, including a narcissistic mom and a grandfather leading a cult-like family. The family is extremely religious and controlling, invading privacy, controlling finances, etc.\n\nThe user is now in a stable relationship, living independently, and is pregnant. The boyfriend hasn't pressured her to tell the family. She's feeling guilty but scared of how they'll react. She worries about the family's judgment, potential harassment, and the impact on her child if the family is involved. She's considering not telling them at all and wants to know if she's in the wrong.\n\nSo, the main question is whether she's in the wrong for not informing her parents. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the family's behavior: the parents were abusive, controlling, and that's a red flag. When someone has left an abusive environment, maintaining distance is often necessary for their well-being. The user's decision to cut ties or minimize contact is a form of self-protection. \n\nIn terms of obligation to inform family, it's situational. Generally, family might expect to know about a pregnancy, especially if they're part of one's life. But in this case, the relationship with the family is strained and toxic. The user's priority is protecting herself and her child from potential harm. \n\nThe mother's argument could be that she has a right to know, but if the family's involvement would be harmful, that right might be outweighed by the child's right to safety. The user's boyfriend isn't pressuring her, which suggests he respects her decision. \n\nThe emotional aspect: the user is scared of the family's reaction, which includes judgment and harassment. The fear of the baby being subjected to the same treatment is a valid concern. The family's religious views might lead them to criticize the unmarried pregnancy, which adds to the user's anxiety. \n\nLegally, there's no obligation to inform family unless there's a custody arrangement or legal ties. Since she's not in contact, there's no legal expectation. Morally, it's more nuanced. If the family isn't part of her life, the responsibility to inform might be lessened. \n\nThe user is also considering the child's future. She's worried the child might resent her for not letting them know the extended family. However, exposing the child to an abusive environment isn't in the child's best interest. \n\nSo, weighing these factors: the user's history of abuse, the current non-relationship with the family, the potential harm from contact, and the child's well-being. It seems that the user isn't in the wrong. She's making a decision that prioritizes her safety and her child's well-being over a strained family connection. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
