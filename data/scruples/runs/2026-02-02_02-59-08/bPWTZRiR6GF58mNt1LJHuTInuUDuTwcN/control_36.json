We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong for not telling her mom about the pregnancy. So, the user wants a yes or no answer based on the given scenario.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author hasn't spoken to her biological family much and only communicates briefly when they contact her. The family has a history of controlling behavior, mental abuse, and religious pressure. She left home at 20 due to this environment. Now she's pregnant, but hasn't told her family, and she's conflicted about whether she should.\n\nThe key points here are the family dynamics. The family is described as abusive, controlling, and manipulative. The author has a legitimate reason to be afraid of telling them. If she tells them, they might react negatively, possibly with anger, blame her for being unmarried, and could potentially harm her child. The fear isn't unfounded because of their past behavior. \n\nThe question is about whether she's in the wrong. Legally, there's no obligation to inform family unless there's a specific legal requirement, like if the family has custody rights or if the child is part of their care. But emotionally or morally, is she wrong? Well, from her perspective, she's protecting herself and her child from a harmful environment. The family isn't a supportive one, and she's trying to create a safe space for her and her baby. \n\nThe argument against her could be that she's hiding it from her family, but if they haven't been part of her life and have been toxic, it's not really hiding. The family hasn't reached out in a supportive way, so her not sharing the news isn't a lie in the traditional sense. Also, considering the potential harm, it's a protective measure rather than a wrong action.\n\nThe author is also considering the child's future. She's worried the family might treat the child poorly, just like she was treated. It's a valid concern, and protecting the child from that is a responsible choice. The boyfriend isn't pressuring her, which adds to the idea that it's her decision to make without external pressure.\n\nSo, putting this together, the author is not in the wrong. Her decision is based on protecting herself and her child from a harmful family environment. The answer should be B.\n"
