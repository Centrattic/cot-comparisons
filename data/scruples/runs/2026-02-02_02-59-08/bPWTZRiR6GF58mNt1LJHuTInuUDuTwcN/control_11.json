We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not telling her mom about being pregnant. The situation is that the author left her family two years ago because of controlling and abusive behavior. The family is described as very controlling, religious, and abusive. The author is now pregnant and hasn't told them, and she's scared of their reaction.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the context. The key points here are the history of abuse and the lack of contact. The author hasn't had any meaningful communication with her family, only occasional texts that turn into arguments. The family's behavior was controlling and invasive, which led her to leave. \n\nThe question is whether not telling her mom about the pregnancy makes her the asshole. The options are A for yes, B for no. \n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, if someone is in a situation where contact with their family is harmful or non-existent due to abuse, it's not necessarily their fault for not sharing information. The author is protecting herself from potential harm. The family hasn't reached out in a healthy way, so the responsibility isn't on her to maintain contact. \n\nAlso, the author's reasons are valid: fear of harassment, judgment, and the well-being of her child. She's prioritizing her emotional safety and her child's future, which is understandable. The fact that her boyfriend hasn't pressured her also shows that her decision isn't being forced by others. \n\nThe guilt she feels might come from societal expectations, but in this case, the family's actions have been harmful. There's no obligation to inform people who are not supportive or who have a history of abuse. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong. She's making a choice based on her past experiences and self-preservation.\n"
