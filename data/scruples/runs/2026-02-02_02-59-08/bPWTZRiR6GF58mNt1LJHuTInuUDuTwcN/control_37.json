We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not telling her mom about being pregnant. The situation is pretty detailed.\n\nFirst, the author left her family two years ago because they were controlling and abusive. She's now pregnant with her boyfriend's child. She hasn't told her family, who she's not on good terms with. The family reaches out occasionally but it's hostile. She's scared of their reaction, especially regarding being unmarried and having a child. She's worried about her daughter's future interactions with them too.\n\nSo, the main points here are the family's history of abuse, the lack of communication, and her fear of their response. The question is whether she's wrong for keeping it a secret.\n\nFrom what I understand, the author has valid reasons for not contacting her family. The family was abusive and controlling. She left to escape that, found a stable life, and is now in a happy relationship. Sharing the pregnancy could expose her and her child to further abuse or toxic behavior. The fact that her family hasn't been supportive and has a history of mental abuse makes it a risk to reach out. Also, the term \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) suggests she's feeling conflicted but the community might weigh in on her justified reasons.\n\nIn legal terms, there's no obligation to inform family unless there's a custody situation or something similar, which isn't mentioned here. Emotionally, she's making a choice to protect herself and her child from a harmful environment. The key here is that the family's actions were the root cause of the separation. She's not cutting them off out of spite, but due to their behavior. Therefore, the answer is likely B (not in the wrong).\n"
