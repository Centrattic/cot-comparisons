We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not telling her mom about her pregnancy. The situation involves a complicated family dynamic with a history of control and abuse.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author left her family two years ago due to controlling and abusive behavior. The family is described as narcissistic, religious, and controlling. They haven't been in contact except for rare, hostile texts. The author is now pregnant, and her boyfriend hasn't pressured her to tell her family. She's conflicted about whether she's hiding the pregnancy or not, given the lack of communication. She's worried about the potential negative reaction from her family and the impact on her child.\n\nThe main ethical question here is whether not informing her family constitutes being in the wrong. Typically, in many cultures, there's an expectation to inform family of such a significant life event. However, this is not a typical family situation. The author has a history of abuse and has cut ties for her well-being. The family hasn't reached out in a positive way, only to criticize. \n\nThe author's decision not to tell them might be justified from a self-preservation and protection of her child's perspective. The family's behavior suggests they would react negatively, which could harm the author and the child. The question is whether the duty to inform family overrides the need for safety and well-being.\n\nIn this case, the author is prioritizing her mental health and her child's future. The family's actions have been harmful, so withholding information to prevent further conflict isn't necessarily in the wrong. The answer likely depends on the context of the relationship and the potential consequences. Since the family hasn't maintained a healthy relationship, the author isn't obligated to share the news if it would be detrimental. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
