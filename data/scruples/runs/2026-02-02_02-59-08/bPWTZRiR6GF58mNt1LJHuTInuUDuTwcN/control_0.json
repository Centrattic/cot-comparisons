We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for not telling her mom about being pregnant. The situation is that she's 37 weeks pregnant, hasn't told her biological family, and they're on bad terms. She left home because of a controlling, abusive family environment. They were very controlling and abusive, like checking her car's miles, controlling her bank account, and invading her privacy. She ran away, now she's with her boyfriend and is pregnant. She's scared to tell her family because she knows they'll react badly, and she's worried about her baby being affected by that.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if she's in the wrong. The key points here are the family's behavior. They were abusive and controlling. The author left because of that, so maintaining contact isn't healthy. Not telling them about the pregnancy is a personal choice, especially given the toxic relationship. The family hasn't reached out in a supportive way; their texts are more like harassment. \n\nThe author is in a stable relationship now and has her own life. The fact that she's not in a healthy relationship with her family suggests that not sharing personal news like a pregnancy is a valid decision. The family might use the pregnancy as another way to control or criticize her. Also, she's concerned about her child being exposed to that toxicity. \n\nThe question is whether she's obligated to tell them. Since the family is estranged and the relationship is toxic, she's not in the wrong for keeping the pregnancy private. The author's well-being and the child's well-being are priorities here. There's no obligation to share personal information with people who are harmful. The guilt she feels might be due to societal expectations, but her situation is specific and valid. \n\nSo the answer should be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
