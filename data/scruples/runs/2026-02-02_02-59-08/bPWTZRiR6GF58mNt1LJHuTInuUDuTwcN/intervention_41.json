We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not telling her mom about being pregnant. \n\nFirst, the author's family situation is really intense. She ran away from home due to controlling and abusive parents, a narcissistic mom, and a cult-like grandfather. The family is controlling and religious. She hasn't spoken to them in a while except for occasional texts that lead to arguments. \n\nShe's pregnant and hasn't told them. Her boyfriend hasn't pressured her, but she feels a mix of guilt and fear. She's worried about their reaction, potential abuse, and how they might treat her child. Also, she's scared the child might resent her later for not having that side of the family involved.\n\nSo, is she in the wrong? Well, the main points are her safety and the child's well-being. If she's in an abusive environment, keeping her child away from that environment could be protective. The question is whether she's obligated to inform family members who have been harmful in the past. \n\nIn many cases, people have the right to make decisions about their own lives and their children's safety. If she's protecting her child from a toxic family environment, that's a valid reason. Also, the family isn't in her life; they reach out to criticize, not support. \n\nThe guilt she feels might be because societal norms expect family involvement, but her situation is exceptional. The key factors are the family's controlling behavior and the potential harm to the child. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is likely B (not in the wrong). She's prioritizing her safety and her child's well-being, which is reasonable given the context.\n"
