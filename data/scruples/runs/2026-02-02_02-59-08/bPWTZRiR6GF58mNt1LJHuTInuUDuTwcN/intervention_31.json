We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not telling their mom about the pregnancy. The situation is pretty complex.\n\nFirst, the author left their family due to controlling and abusive behavior. The mom is described as narcissistic, and the family is controlling and religious. The author hasn't spoken to them except for occasional texts where the family screams at them. The author is now pregnant, 37 weeks along, and hasn't told the family. They're scared of how the family might react, especially with the judgment about being unmarried. They're also worried about their child being affected by the family's possible treatment.\n\nThe key points here are the family's past behavior, the author's reasons for not contacting them, and the potential consequences of revealing the pregnancy. The author isn't hiding the pregnancy from people who have regular contact; the family only reaches out sporadically. The user's question is whether the author is in the wrong for not informing them.\n\nFrom a typical \"Am I the Asshole?\" perspective, the community often looks at intentions and context. If the family has been abusive and the author is protecting themselves and their child from potential harm, many might see it as justified. The author isn't avoiding communication with the family out of spite but because of genuine fear of their reactions. The fact that the family hasn't been supportive or present in the author's life could also weigh in their favor. \n\nHowever, some might argue that family is important and not informing them could be seen as cutting them off completely. But given the circumstances of abuse and control, the author's decision is more about self-preservation. The author's boyfriend hasn't pressured them, which shows support. Also, considering the child's well-being, the author is trying to prevent a toxic environment.\n\nIn such cases, the community usually sides with the person protecting themselves from abuse. The author isn't in the wrong because they're safeguarding their own mental health and their child's future. The answer would likely be B (not in the wrong) because the decision is based on protecting oneself from a harmful family dynamic.\n"
