We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about whether she should tell her biological family that she's pregnant. She hasn't told them because she doesn't have a good relationship with them. They are described as controlling, abusive, and part of a family with extreme religious views. She ran away from home at 20 due to the abuse.\n\nFirst, the question is whether she's in the wrong for not telling her mom. The key points to consider are the nature of their relationship and the potential consequences. She mentions that they don't speak except for rare texts that turn into arguments. Her mom is a narcissist, and the family is abusive. The author is protecting herself from potential abuse and harm by not revealing the pregnancy. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, if someone is in an unhealthy or abusive environment, choosing not to share personal information that could lead to further harm is understandable. The author is prioritizing her well-being and her child's safety. However, some might argue that withholding such a significant life event could be seen as hiding it, especially if family members might find out eventually. But given the context of abuse and control, it's a protective measure.\n\nThe boyfriend hasn't pressured her, which shows he supports her decision. Also, considering the potential negative reactions\u2014like being judged for being unmarried or the child not having the chance to meet them\u2014she's weighing the risks of exposing her child to that environment. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, if the family isn't part of her life and she's not in contact, then it's not her fault for not sharing. The onus might be on the family to reach out in a healthy way. Since she's made a choice to protect herself and her child from a harmful environment, it's a valid decision. The guilt she feels might stem from societal expectations, but her situation is unique. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is likely B (No, she's not in the wrong) because she's protecting herself and her child from a harmful family dynamic.\n"
