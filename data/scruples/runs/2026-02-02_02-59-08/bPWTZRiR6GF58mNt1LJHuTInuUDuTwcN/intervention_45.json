We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not telling her family about her pregnancy. The author has a history of abuse and control from her family, leading her to leave them. She's now pregnant and hasn't told them, fearing their reaction. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The family is described as controlling, abusive, and part of a cult-like structure with extreme religious views. The author left them for her own safety and well-being. She's in a stable relationship and has a child now. \n\nThe question is about whether not telling her family makes her wrong. The key points are her reasons for not informing them. She's not hiding it from a close relationship but from estranged family members who have been harmful. \n\nI think the answer hinges on intent and circumstances. If someone is deliberately avoiding contact with abusive family to protect themselves and their child, that's understandable. The author isn't in a relationship where she's hiding from someone who has a right to know because they're part of her current life. Her family has been estranged, and she's protecting her child from potential harm. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. She's prioritizing her safety and her child's well-being. The guilt she feels might be due to societal expectations, but her actions are justified given the context.\n"
