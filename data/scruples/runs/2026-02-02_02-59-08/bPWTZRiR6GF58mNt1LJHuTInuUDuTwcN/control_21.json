We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not telling her mom about being pregnant. The author has a complicated relationship with her family, having run away due to controlling and abusive behavior. The family is described as extremely controlling and mentally abusive, with the mother being narcissistic and the grandfather running the family like a cult. They had a very distant relationship even before the pregnancy, with rare and hostile contact.\n\nThe key points here are the history of abuse and control. The author left the family environment because of their toxic behavior. The family hasn't been supportive or present in her life. The question is whether not informing them about the pregnancy makes her wrong. \n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, family is often considered important, but in cases of abuse and neglect, the priority shifts to protecting oneself and the child. The author is prioritizing her well-being and her child's future by not exposing them to a harmful environment. The fear of the family's reaction, potential judgment, and the risk of the child being subjected to the same treatment are valid concerns. \n\nThe author isn't hiding the pregnancy from people who are actively involved in her life; rather, it's a family that has been absent and abusive. The decision not to tell them can be seen as self-preservation and protecting her child from a toxic influence. There's no obligation to maintain contact with family that has been harmful. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No), because the author is not in the wrong for choosing not to disclose the pregnancy to her family given the history of abuse and the lack of a healthy relationship.\n"
