We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not telling her mom about being pregnant. The situation seems pretty complex.\n\nFirst, the author ran away from home at 20 because of a controlling, abusive family. The mom is described as narcissistic, and the grandfather runs the family like a cult. They were extremely controlling, invading her privacy, controlling her finances. That's a lot of abuse. She left, found her own stability, and is now pregnant with her partner's child.\n\nShe hasn't told her biological family, and the question is whether she's in the wrong. The user initially thinks she is, but wants others' opinions. The options are A (yes, wrong) or B (no, not wrong).\n\nI need to consider the context. The family hasn't been supportive. They only reach out to scream at her. The author has a history of abuse. Keeping something like a pregnancy secret might be self-preservation. However, the author feels guilty and wonders if it's hiding because they haven't talked in months. But if there's no meaningful contact, is it hiding? Also, the fear of the family's reaction, especially regarding being unmarried and the potential treatment of the child.\n\nLegally, there's no obligation to inform family unless there's a custody issue, which isn't mentioned. Emotionally and ethically, it's about her safety and well-being. If the family is toxic, she's not in the wrong for protecting herself and her child. The partner hasn't pressured her, which supports her decision.\n\nThe author is scared they'll blame her for not mentioning it during their last brief contact. But if the contact was hostile, she's not obligated to share personal news. Also, considering the child's future, she's worried about the family's treatment. That's a valid concern.\n\nSo, in this scenario, the author made a choice to protect herself from an abusive environment. Not telling the family isn't wrong given the circumstances. The answer would be B: No, she's not in the wrong.\n"
