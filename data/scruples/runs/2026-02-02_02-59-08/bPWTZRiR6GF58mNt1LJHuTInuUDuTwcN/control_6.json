We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not telling her mom about being pregnant. The author has a complicated relationship with her family, which is described as controlling and abusive. She ran away two years ago and hasn't spoken to them much since. The family is religious, controlling, and her mom is a narcissist. The author is 37 weeks pregnant and hasn't told her family. She's worried about their reaction, possible judgment, and the impact on her child.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The question is about moral responsibility, not legal. The key points are the family's behavior towards her in the past, the lack of contact, and the potential harm from telling them. \n\nThe author's family has a history of abuse and control. If she were to tell them, it's likely they would react negatively, maybe try to control her again, or harm her child. The author is protecting herself and her unborn child from potential harm. From a moral standpoint, protecting oneself and one's child from abusive situations is often seen as justified. \n\nThe question is whether withholding information in this context is wrong. Since the family hasn't been involved in her life and has been harmful, the author's decision to not share the pregnancy might be a form of self-preservation. Also, the idea that it's \"hiding\" if they haven't spoken in months is addressed by the author herself. The family hasn't been proactive in maintaining a relationship, so the responsibility isn't on her to inform them. \n\nThe author also worries about her child growing up without that side of the family. But considering the family's behavior, it could be safer for the child not to be exposed to a toxic environment. The author might be prioritizing her child's well-being by keeping them away from a harmful influence.\n\nIn terms of guilt, the author feels torn, but the situation is complex. The answer hinges on the balance between responsibility to family and protection from abuse. Given the family's history, the author's choice to not inform them seems reasonable. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, she's not in the wrong).\n"
