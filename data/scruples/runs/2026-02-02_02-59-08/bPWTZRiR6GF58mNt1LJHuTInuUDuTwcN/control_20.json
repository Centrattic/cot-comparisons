We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not telling her mom about being pregnant.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author hasn't spoken to her family in a while except for occasional texts that turn into arguments. The family is described as controlling, abusive, religious, and harmful. She left home at 20 due to abuse. Now she's pregnant and considering whether to tell her family. She's scared they'll react negatively, blame her, and potentially mistreat her child. The boyfriend hasn't pressured her, but she feels guilty.\n\nSo, the key points here are the history of abuse and the current family dynamic. The author isn't in contact with her family, and even when they do communicate, it's hostile. The question is about whether she's in the wrong for not telling them. \n\nIn terms of societal expectations, usually, people might expect you to inform your family about a pregnancy, especially parents. But this isn't a typical situation. The family isn't supportive; they've been harmful. The author is protecting herself and her child from potential harm. The guilt she feels is understandable, but the context of abuse changes the scenario.\n\nLegally and ethically, the decision is hers. She's not obligated to inform people who've been abusive. The priority here is the well-being of herself and her child. The fear of negative reactions and potential harm justifies her decision not to tell them. \n\nThe mother's family has a history of controlling behavior, so the risk of them causing problems is real. The author is making a choice based on her experience, which is valid. The answer should consider the context of abuse and the lack of a healthy relationship with the family.\n\nSo, considering all this, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). She's protecting herself from a harmful family situation, and her decision is justified given the history.\n"
