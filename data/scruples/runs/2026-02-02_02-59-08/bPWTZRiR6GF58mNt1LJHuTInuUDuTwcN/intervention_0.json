We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not telling their mom they're pregnant. Let's break down the details.\n\nFirst, the author left home at 20 due to a controlling and abusive family. The mom is described as narcissistic, and the family is religious and controlling. They ran their lives in a cult-like way, invading privacy, controlling finances, and so on. The author has been on good terms with their boyfriend, has a stable life, and is now pregnant. They haven't told their family because of the fear of how they'd react. The boyfriend hasn't pressured them, but they feel guilty. The author is scared of family backlash, the baby's future with them, and potential hatred later. They're conflicted between guilt and fear.\n\nNow, the key points here are the history of abuse and control. The author's decision not to tell their family is rooted in self-preservation and protection of their child. From a moral standpoint, if the family is abusive, the author isn't obligated to reconnect. They're prioritizing their safety and their child's well-being. The fact that they haven't spoken to the family much and the family's history of being toxic makes the author's choice understandable. The guilt comes from societal expectations, but the situation isn't that simple. The family isn't reaching out in a healthy way\u2014they're more like \"screaming\" when they do. So, the author isn't hiding the pregnancy from a healthy relationship; it's a hostile one. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for not disclosing. The answer should be B.\n"
