We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for not telling their mom they're pregnant. They have a complicated relationship with their biological family, which has been controlling and abusive. The user ran away at 20 due to that environment. The family is described as extremely controlling, even checking car mileage, controlling finances, and invading privacy. The user is now pregnant with her boyfriend's child and hasn't told her family.\n\nThe user feels guilty about not telling them but is scared of their reaction. The boyfriend hasn't pushed her to tell. The user is worried about their judgment, especially since they're religious and might disapprove of her being unmarried. She's also worried about her future child growing up without that side of the family, but fears how they'd treat the child.\n\nSo, the question is whether she's in the wrong. I need to evaluate if not telling her family makes her at fault. The key points here are the history of abuse and control. In situations where there's a history of toxic behavior, not contacting the family isn't necessarily wrong. The family hasn't maintained a healthy relationship; they reach out only to criticize. The user isn't hiding the pregnancy from someone who's actively involved in her life but rather from estranged family who have shown controlling and harmful behavior.\n\nThe user's reasons for not telling are rooted in self-preservation and protecting her child from a potentially harmful environment. There's no obligation to reconnect with a family that has been abusive, especially when it's clear that contact would be harmful. The guilt she feels might stem from societal expectations, but in this context, her actions are protective. Therefore, she's not in the wrong for prioritizing her well-being and her child's.\n"
