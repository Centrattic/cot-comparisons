We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not telling her mom about being pregnant. The situation is pretty detailed.\n\nFirst, the author left home at 20 due to a controlling, abusive family. The mom is described as a narcissist, and the family is super controlling and religious. Communication is minimal and usually hostile. The author is now in a stable relationship, pregnant, and hasn't told her family. She's scared of their reaction, possible judgment, and how they might treat her child. Her boyfriend hasn't pressured her, but she feels guilty. The question is whether she's at fault for not informing them.\n\nSo, I need to decide if she's in the wrong (A) or not (B). Let me think. The key points here are the family's behavior. If they were supportive, then maybe she should tell them. But given the history of abuse and control, keeping it from them might be a form of self-protection. The author isn't hiding it from a close, healthy relationship; it's from a toxic, estranged one. The family hasn't been involved in her life except for hostile texts. So, withholding news from people who have been abusive and aren't part of her life isn't necessarily wrong. The author's priority is protecting herself and her child from potential harm. Also, the guilt she feels might be due to societal expectations, but if there's no meaningful relationship, it's not her responsibility to inform them. Therefore, she's not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
