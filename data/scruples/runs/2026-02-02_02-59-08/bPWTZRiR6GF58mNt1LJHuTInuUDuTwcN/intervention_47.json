We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not telling her mom she's pregnant. The author has a complicated relationship with her biological family. She ran away at 20 due to a controlling and abusive environment. Now she's 37 weeks pregnant, and hasn't told her family. They only contact her occasionally to scream at her. She's scared of their reaction, especially since they're religious and might not approve of her being unmarried. She's also worried about her child's future with the family.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of her family's behavior. The author describes her mom as a narcissist and her grandfather's family as controlling, invasive, and cult-like. There's a history of abuse. In such cases, cutting off contact is often a healthy decision. The family isn't supportive; they've harassed her in the past. So, not sharing the pregnancy might not be a matter of hiding it but protecting herself and her child from harm.\n\nThe user initially thought the author is in the wrong but is unsure. The key question is whether the author has a moral obligation to inform her parents. But if the parents aren't part of her life and have been abusive, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. The decision to not involve toxic family members in her child's life could be seen as protective. The author is prioritizing her and her child's well-being over societal expectations of family obligations. \n\nAlso, the fact that the family hasn't been supportive and have a history of abuse means that the author isn't neglecting a duty but making a choice based on safety. The guilt she feels might be from societal pressures, but ethically, she's not in the wrong if the family isn't part of her life. So the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
