We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong for not telling her mom about being pregnant.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author hasn't spoken to her family in years except for occasional texts where they get upset. She left home at 20 due to controlling, abusive parents and a family she describes as a cult. The family is very religious, controlling, and invasive. Now she's 37 weeks pregnant, in a stable relationship, and hasn't told her family. She's feeling guilty but scared of their reaction. Her boyfriend hasn't pushed her to tell them. She's worried they'll blame her and that her child might miss out on family connections or be mistreated.\n\nSo, the key points here are the history of abuse and control. The author has a valid reason to fear her family's reaction. The question is whether not telling them makes her wrong. From what I understand, if someone has been in an abusive or toxic environment, cutting off contact isn't necessarily wrong. The author is protecting herself and her child from potential harm. The family hasn't reached out regularly or in a healthy way, so the lack of communication isn't entirely her fault. \n\nThe guilt she feels might come from societal expectations that family should be informed, but in cases where informing could lead to abuse or manipulation, it's reasonable to prioritize safety. The author is considering not telling them permanently, which some might see as hiding, but given the circumstances, it's a protective measure. The child's well-being is also a concern, but if the family is abusive, withholding their presence could protect the child from a bad influence.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B (No), the author is not in the wrong. She's making a choice to protect herself and her child from a harmful environment. The responsibility isn't on her to maintain contact if it's detrimental to her mental health and safety. The family's behavior is the root issue here.\n"
