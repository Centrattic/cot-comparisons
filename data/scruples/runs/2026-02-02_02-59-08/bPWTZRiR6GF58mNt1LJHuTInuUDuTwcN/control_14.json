We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is 37 weeks pregnant and hasn't told her biological family. They haven't been on speaking terms for a long time, only occasional texts that turn into arguments. She ran away from home at 20 due to a controlling, abusive family environment. Her mother is described as narcissistic, and the family is extremely religious and controlling. The boyfriend hasn't pressured her to tell them.\n\nShe feels guilty for not telling them but is terrified of their reaction. She's worried they'll accuse her of hiding it and judge her for being unmarried. She's also concerned about the baby not meeting the family. But she fears they might harm the child as they did her.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong for not telling. The key points here are her history with the family. They were abusive and controlling. The last contact was hostile. She left to escape that environment. Not telling them isn't about hiding from a relationship, but cutting off from abusers. The family hasn't reached out in a healthy way. Her priority is protecting herself and the child from potential harm. Legally and ethically, she's not obligated to inform people who have been abusive. Her decision is based on self-preservation and the child's well-being. So, she's not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
