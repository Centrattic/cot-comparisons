We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for not telling their mom they're pregnant. The family isn't really in contact except for occasional, stressful texts where the mom yells. The person ran away because of a controlling, abusive family. The mom is described as narcissistic, and the grandfather runs the family like a cult. They left at 20, found a job and a partner, and are now pregnant.\n\nThe main points here are the history of abuse and lack of a healthy relationship. The user hasn't had contact with the family except for negative interactions. They're scared of the family's reaction and the potential harm to their child if they meet the family. The boyfriend hasn't pressured them to tell, but the user feels conflicted.\n\nThe question is whether not telling the parent is in the wrong. The user argues that it's not hiding if they haven't spoken in months, which makes sense because there's no regular communication. The parent's last contact was hostile, so the user has valid reasons for not engaging further. The user is also protecting their child from possibly harmful interactions based on their own experiences.\n\nIn terms of AITA (Am I the Asshole) standards, the author isn't doing anything illegal. They're prioritizing their safety and their child's well-being. The family's behavior is toxic, so the author isn't obligated to maintain contact. There's no evidence that the author is avoiding responsibility or being selfish here; they're making a difficult decision based on their circumstances. Therefore, the answer would be B (not in the wrong).\n"
