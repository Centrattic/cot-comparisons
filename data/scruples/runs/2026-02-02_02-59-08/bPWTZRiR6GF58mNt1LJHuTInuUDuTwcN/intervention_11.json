We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for not telling their mom they're pregnant. The family situation is pretty intense\u2014abusive, controlling parents, a mom with narcissistic tendencies, and a cult-like grandfather. They left home at 20 due to mental abuse. Now, they're pregnant, haven't told their family, and are feeling guilty but scared of the consequences.\n\nFirst, the question is whether they're in the wrong. The core issue here is about family obligations versus personal safety and well-being. The author has a history of abuse and control. In such cases, not maintaining contact or sharing major life events can be a form of self-preservation. If the family is toxic, withholding information might be necessary to protect themselves and their child.\n\nThe user mentions that the family doesn't reach out with genuine communication but with harassment when they do. The author isn't avoiding contact; instead, they're responding to rare texts that turn into confrontations. This suggests that the family isn't maintaining a healthy relationship. \n\nAlso, the author is in a stable, happy relationship and has a good life now. The child's well-being is another factor. Exposing the child to a toxic family might not be in their best interest. The author is considering the child's future too, which shows they're thinking long-term.\n\nLegally and ethically, there's no obligation to maintain contact with family members who have been abusive. The author isn't hiding the pregnancy from everyone; just the family they've already distanced from. The guilt they feel might come from societal expectations about family, but their situation is unique and harmful.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. They're prioritizing their mental health and their child's safety. The answer should be B.\n"
