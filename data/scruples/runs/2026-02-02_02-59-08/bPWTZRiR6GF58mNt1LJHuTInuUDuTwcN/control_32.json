We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not telling her mom about being pregnant. The situation is complex. The author ran away from a controlling, abusive family two years ago. They haven't been in contact much, and when they do talk, it's hostile. The author is now pregnant and hasn't told her family, fearing their reaction.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the definition of \"in the wrong.\" Generally, it's about whether someone has done something morally or ethically wrong. Here, the key points are the family's past behavior and the current non-communication. The author left because of abuse and control, so maintaining distance might be necessary for her well-being.\n\nThe question is if not informing them is wrong. If they haven't been in contact except for occasional hostile texts, then the author isn't obligated to share personal updates. The family hasn't made an effort to maintain a healthy relationship. The author's decision to protect herself and her child from potential harm could be seen as justifiable.\n\nThere's also the aspect of the child's future. The author is worried about the child not knowing the family, but given the family's toxic behavior, keeping them away might be in the child's best interest. The guilt she feels is understandable, but if the family isn't supportive, withholding information isn't necessarily wrong.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author isn't in the wrong because she's prioritizing her safety and her child's well-being over a family that has been abusive and uninvolved.\n"
