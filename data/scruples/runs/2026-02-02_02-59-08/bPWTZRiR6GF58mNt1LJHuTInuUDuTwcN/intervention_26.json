We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong for not telling her mom about her pregnancy. The author isn't in contact with her biological family, who have been abusive and controlling. She ran away at 20 due to their behavior. Now, she's pregnant and hasn't told them. She's considering if she's in the wrong for keeping it a secret.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the situation. The key points are the family's history of abuse, control, and the author's fear of their reaction. The family hasn't reached out much, only occasionally with hostile texts. The author is in a stable relationship and has built a life away from her family. She's worried about her child being exposed to the same treatment she experienced.\n\nThe question is whether not informing her family makes her the asshole. From a moral standpoint, if the family has been harmful and there's no meaningful contact, the author has every right to prioritize her well-being and her child's. The obligation to inform family might exist if there's a close relationship, but in this case, the relationship is fractured and hostile. The author isn't hiding the pregnancy from people who are part of her life; it's from a family that has been abusive. So, in this context, not telling them isn't wrong. The answer should be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. Her decision is based on self-protection and protecting her child from potential harm.\n"
