We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for not telling her mom about being pregnant. The situation involves a history of abuse and control from her family.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author left her family due to controlling and abusive behavior. They haven't been in contact except for occasional texts that turn into arguments. The family is described as extremely controlling, religious, and potentially harmful. The author is now in a stable relationship and pregnant, but she's afraid of how her family would react, especially regarding her being unmarried and the potential treatment of her child.\n\nThe main question is whether she's in the wrong for not informing her biological family. From an ethical standpoint, the responsibility here isn't straightforward. If the family has cut off contact and the author hasn't reached out, it's debatable whether she's obligated to inform them. Also, considering the abusive history, prioritizing her well-being and her child's safety is crucial. The author's fear of backlash and harm to her child is valid given the family's behavior.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that family has a right to know about a grandchild. But given the circumstances\u2014abuse, no contact, potential harm\u2014it's more about protecting herself and her child. The author isn't hiding the pregnancy from active contact; the family hasn't been part of her life. So, it's not her fault for not telling them, especially when it could lead to negative consequences.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B: No, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
