We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for not telling their mom they're pregnant. The context is that they ran away from home because of a controlling, abusive family. Their mom is a narcissist, and the family is religious, controlling, and invasive. They haven't had contact except for occasional texts that turn into arguments. The person is now pregnant and considering whether to tell their family.\n\nFirst, the user needs to know if not telling their mom is wrong. From the description, the family has a history of abuse and control. The person left because of this, so maintaining contact isn't a given. The mother's behavior is described as toxic and invasive. The user is now in a stable relationship and has a child. They're scared of the family's reaction\u2014probably because of the mom's narcissism and the family's controlling ways. They're worried about the child being raised in that environment.\n\nThe key points here are the history of abuse and the lack of communication. If the family hasn't been part of the user's life in a healthy way, then not sharing the pregnancy isn't necessarily wrong. The mother's lack of contact and the toxic environment mean that the user isn't obligated to include them. The user is protecting their child from potential harm, which is a valid reason. The family might claim the user is hiding the pregnancy, but given their behavior, it's more about the user protecting themselves and their child. So, the answer is B\u2014they're not in the wrong.\n"
