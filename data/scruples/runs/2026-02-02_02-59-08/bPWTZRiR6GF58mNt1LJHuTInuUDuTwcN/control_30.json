We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong for not telling their mom they're pregnant. The situation is pretty complicated. The author has a strained relationship with their biological family, including a mom who's described as a narcissistic parent and a controlling grandfather. They ran away when they were 20 because of the abuse and now they're pregnant with their boyfriend's child.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The family isn't in regular contact; they only occasionally text and those texts turn into screaming. The author hasn't been in contact with them except when they reach out. The main issue is whether not informing the family about the pregnancy is wrong. \n\nThe author feels guilty about hiding it but points out that the family hasn't spoken to them much. The key points are the history of abuse and control. The family's behavior is toxic, involving invasion of privacy, controlling finances, and emotional abuse. The author left for a reason, found stability, and is now in a healthy relationship. \n\nNow, the question is if the author is in the wrong. The answer probably depends on the circumstances. Since the family hasn't been supportive and the communication is hostile, not sharing the news isn't necessarily wrong. The author is protecting themselves and their child from potential harm. The guilt might come from societal expectations, but the reality here is a toxic family environment. \n\nThe author is also worried about the baby meeting the family and facing the same treatment. That's a valid concern. There's a difference between not sharing news with family who isn't part of your life versus hiding it from a supportive family. In this case, the family isn't supportive, so the author's choice to not inform them is a protective measure. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). They are prioritizing their well-being and their child's, which is understandable given the family's history.\n"
