We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not telling their mom about the pregnancy.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author left an abusive, controlling family two years ago. They have no real contact except occasional hostile texts. The family is described as controlling, religious, and abusive. The author is now in a stable relationship and pregnant. They're considering not telling their family because of fear of their reaction and potential harm to the baby. The boyfriend hasn't pressured them.\n\nThe main question is about obligation to family. But given the history of abuse, is there an obligation? The author is in a situation where contact is minimal and hostile. The family hasn't been part of their life, so maybe there's no expectation to inform them. Also, the family's values might be harmful, so the author is protecting their child from that.\n\nThe author feels guilt because they know they should tell them, but the last interaction was hostile. They fear being blamed or the family harming the child. The question is whether the author is at fault for not sharing this information when there's no real relationship, and when sharing might be harmful.\n\nIn terms of ethics, sometimes protecting oneself and one's child from harmful family dynamics is prioritized. The author isn't avoiding responsibility unless there's an active relationship. Since the family hasn't been supportive or respectful, the author isn't obligated to inform them. Therefore, the answer would be that the author isn't in the wrong (B).\n"
