We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Ask the Internet\" (AITA) post is in the wrong for not telling her mom about being pregnant. The situation is pretty intense. The author left her family two years ago because of controlling and abusive behavior. Her mother is described as narcissistic, and the family is extremely religious, controlling, and even cult-like. The author is now pregnant, and her boyfriend hasn't pressured her to tell her family. She's conflicted because she feels guilty but is terrified of their reaction and the potential harm to her child.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are the family's past behavior. If the family was abusive and controlling, then withholding information about her pregnancy might be a protective measure. The user is 37 weeks pregnant, so the baby is due soon. The mother hasn't contacted her family in a long time, and when they do reach out, it's hostile. The author is worried about her family's reaction\u2014likely criticism for being unmarried, which is a big deal given their religious views. Also, she's concerned about her child being subjected to the same treatment.\n\nIn terms of ethics, if the family is a toxic environment, then the author's decision not to inform them could be seen as protecting both herself and her child. The question is whether she's obligated to inform family members about her pregnancy. Legally, there's no obligation, but socially, people often expect some level of communication. However, in cases of abuse, that expectation might not apply. The author's family has a history of invasion of privacy and control, so trusting them with this information might not be safe.\n\nThe guilt she feels is understandable, but it's also possible that her family would indeed react negatively, as she anticipates. The idea of the child growing up without that side of the family could be a point against her, but if the family is harmful, maybe it's better for the child not to be exposed. The author is prioritizing her and her child's well-being over the potential for a strained or harmful relationship.\n\nSo, considering all this, the answer would likely be that she's not in the wrong (B). She's in a situation where the family's past actions justify her decision to keep the pregnancy secret. The key factors are the history of abuse, the toxic environment, and the protective instincts towards her child.\n"
