We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is 37 weeks pregnant and hasn't told their biological family. The family isn't on speaking terms, only occasional texts that turn into arguments. They ran away from home at 20 due to a controlling, abusive mother and a cult-like grandfather. The family is religious and controlling, invading privacy. Now, the person is in a stable situation with a supportive boyfriend. They feel guilty for not telling the family but are scared of the backlash, including potential abuse towards their child. The question is whether they're in the wrong for not telling.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the family's behavior. The family is described as abusive, controlling, and mentally harmful. The person left because of this, which is a valid reason to cut ties. The family hasn't been supportive; they only reach out to argue. So, not telling them about the pregnancy might be a protective measure.\n\nThe person's reasons for not telling are fear of negative reactions, including the family's potential treatment of the child. The family might not accept the pregnancy outside of marriage, given their strict religious views. The person is worried about their child being exposed to the same abuse. That's a strong reason to avoid contact.\n\nThe guilt comes from feeling like it's a secret, but if the family isn't a healthy part of their life, keeping it secret isn't necessarily wrong. The person is prioritizing their well-being and their child's safety. The family hasn't been proactive in maintaining a relationship, only reaching out to harrass. So, the responsibility isn't on the person to reach out. \n\nIn terms of ethics, the person isn't obligated to put themselves or their child in harm's way just to \"tell\" the family. The family's behavior makes them the ones at fault, not the person who left. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for not telling.\n"
