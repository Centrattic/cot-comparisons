We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the person is asking if they're in the wrong for not telling their mom they're pregnant. The situation is that they ran away from a controlling, abusive family two years ago. Their mom's a narcissist, and the family's really religious and controlling. They haven't been in contact except for occasional texts that turn into yelling. Now they're 37 weeks pregnant, their boyfriend isn't pressuring them, but they feel guilty. The main question is whether they're at fault for not telling their family.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The person left a toxic environment. The family was abusive, controlling, invading privacy, etc. So, there's a valid reason to be cautious. The user is protecting themselves and their child from potential harm. The family might react negatively, maybe blame the daughter, and could be unkind to the baby. The person is scared their baby might suffer the same treatment they did. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, if someone is in a family that's been abusive, it's reasonable to prioritize their well-being and their child's. Not contacting family that's been toxic isn't necessarily wrong. The fact that they haven't been in touch except for negative interactions supports their decision. They also mention feeling fear about how the family would react, which is a valid concern. \n\nThe question is if they're in the wrong. If the family hasn't been supportive or respectful, keeping their distance is a form of self-preservation. The user isn't hiding the pregnancy from active family members but from estranged, abusive ones. So, the answer would likely be B (not in the wrong). They have legitimate reasons to avoid contact. The guilt they feel might be from societal expectations, but their priority is their safety and their child's, which is valid.\n"
