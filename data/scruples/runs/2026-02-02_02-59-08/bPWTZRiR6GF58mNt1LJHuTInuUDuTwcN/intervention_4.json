We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not telling her mom about being pregnant. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author hasn't told her biological family that she's 37 weeks pregnant. They have a very strained relationship\u2014only occasional texts that turn into screaming matches. The family is described as controlling and abusive, with the mother being narcissistic and the grandfather running a cult-like household. The author ran away at 20 due to this abuse. Now she's in a stable relationship and has a child. She's conflicted about whether to tell her family, fearing their reaction and potential harm to her child. The boyfriend hasn't pressured her, but she feels guilty. She's worried about the family's response, the possibility of them disapproving because she's unmarried, and the impact on her daughter meeting them.\n\nThe user initially thought the author might be in the wrong, but the question is whether the author is in the wrong. So I need to evaluate the moral or ethical aspects here. \n\nFirst, the family has a history of abuse and control. The author left to escape that. She's protecting herself from a harmful environment. Not contacting them is a way to maintain her autonomy and safety. By not telling them about the pregnancy, she's avoiding potential conflict and harm. The family hasn't reached out in a healthy way; their interactions are hostile. \n\nThe key points are the family's behavior and the author's reasons for not informing them. If the family is abusive, then the author is prioritizing her safety and her child's well-being by not contacting them. In many cases, cutting off contact with abusive family members is advised by professionals. The guilt she feels might stem from societal expectations or a sense of obligation, but given the circumstances, her choice could be justified as self-preservation.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that family is important and that she should make an effort to include them, especially since she might feel guilty. However, considering the context of abuse and the lack of a healthy relationship, it's more about protecting herself and her child from potential abuse or manipulation. \n\nI think the answer here leans towards the author not being in the wrong (B). She's making a difficult decision based on her past experiences and the well-being of her child. The \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole?) forums often consider context like this, where the person has a valid reason for their actions. The family's actions and the author's history with them are crucial factors. Therefore, B would be the correct answer here.\n"
