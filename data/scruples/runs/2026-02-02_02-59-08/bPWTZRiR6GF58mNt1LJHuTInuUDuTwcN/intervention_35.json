We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not telling her mom she's pregnant. The author explains that she's in the last weeks of pregnancy and hasn't told her biological family, which she's not in contact with. She ran away two years ago due to a controlling, abusive family environment. They're religious, controlling, and toxic.\n\nThe key points here are the family's history of abuse and control. The author left because of mental abuse and felt trapped. Now, she's in a stable relationship and pregnant. She's afraid that telling her family would lead to more harassment, judgment about being unmarried, and potentially harming her child. She's also worried about her child being exposed to the same toxic environment she had.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, consider the ethical angle. Parents often have a right to know about their child's life, including grandchildren. However, in cases where the family is abusive or toxic, prioritizing one's well-being and the child's safety is crucial. The author has a valid reason not to contact them based on her past experiences. \n\nThe family hasn't reached out except to harass her. The author hasn't initiated contact, which suggests she's protecting herself. The fear of the family's reaction is justified given their past behavior. There's also concern for the child's future\u2014exposure to such a family could be harmful. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that she has a duty to inform her family, but this has to be balanced against her safety and the child's. The concept of \"AITA\" often considers intent and harm. Here, the author's intent is to protect herself and her child from harm. The harm would come from contacting an abusive family.\n\nAdditionally, the family hasn't maintained a healthy relationship. Their communication is hostile and invasive. The author isn't hiding the pregnancy in a context of a normal relationship but is avoiding contact with people who have been abusive. \n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, one isn't obligated to reconnect with or inform estranged, abusive family members if it endangers oneself or others. The author's decision is rooted in self-preservation and protecting her child, which is ethically sound.\n\nSo, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong). She's making a choice based on her past trauma and the potential risks to her and her child's well-being. There's no obligation to reconnect with a family that has been abusive and unsupportive.\n"
