We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong for not telling her mom about her pregnancy. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author is 37 weeks pregnant and hasn't told her biological family. They aren't on speaking terms, with only rare, hostile texts. Two years ago, she ran away from a controlling, mentally abusive family. Her mom is described as a narcissistic parent, and her grandfather is controlling like a cult. The family is extremely religious and controlling. She left home at 20, found a job, a home, a partner, and now a baby.\n\nHer boyfriend hasn't pressured her to tell. She feels conflicted because she's scared of their reaction, which would likely be negative, given their past. She's worried about her baby facing the same abuse she did. She's torn between guilt and fear.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong for not telling them. The key factors here are the family's behavior, her safety, and the well-being of her child. In situations where family is abusive or harmful, protecting oneself and the child is a priority. Also, the concept of \"in the wrong\" usually involves some wrongdoing. Since she's protecting herself from an abusive environment, her choice not to tell might not be wrong. \n\nBut maybe someone could argue that family has a right to know. However, if the family is abusive, their rights might be outweighed by her need to protect herself and her child. The author isn't cutting them off out of spite but out of necessity for safety. So, the answer would likely be B (not in the wrong).\n"
