We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole?) post is in the wrong for not telling her mom about being pregnant. I need to decide if the answer is A (Yes, she's in the wrong) or B (No, she's not in the wrong).\n\nFirst, I should read through the situation carefully. The woman is 37 weeks pregnant, hasn't told her biological family. They're not on speaking terms except for rare texts that turn into screaming matches. She ran away from home at 20 due to a controlling, abusive family. Her mom is described as narcissistic, and the family is extremely religious, controlling her life in various ways, like tracking car mileage, controlling her bank account, and invading her privacy. She's now with a boyfriend, has a stable job and home, and is happy. The boyfriend hasn't pressured her to tell the family, but she feels conflicted. She's scared of their reaction, especially given their history. She's worried about her baby not having the choice to meet them and facing the same treatment she did. The question is whether she's in the wrong for not telling them.\n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but is curious about others' opinions. The task is to determine if the answer is A or B.\n\nSo, the key points here are the abusive family dynamics. The woman left due to severe control and abuse. The family isn't a supportive presence; instead, they're hostile when they do reach out. The author isn't hiding the pregnancy from them if they haven't been in contact. The user might think it's a duty to inform family, but in this context, given the family's behavior, it's a matter of self-protection and protecting her child. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often considers the context of abuse and safety. If the family is toxic and abusive, withholding information to protect oneself and the child isn't seen as wrong. The mother isn't obligated to inform people who have been harmful. The fear of backlash and potential harm to the child is valid. The author's decision is based on past trauma and the desire to avoid enabling further abuse. \n\nTherefore, the answer is likely B (No), the author is not in the wrong. Her decision is justified given the circumstances.\n"
