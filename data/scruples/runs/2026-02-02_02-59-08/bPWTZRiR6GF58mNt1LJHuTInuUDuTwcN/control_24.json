We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is a pregnant woman who hasn't told her biological family about her pregnancy. She has a history of being in a controlling and abusive family environment. She ran away at 20 because her mom is a narcissist and her grandfather runs the family like a cult. They're extremely religious and controlling. Now she's with her boyfriend and has a stable life, but she's worried about telling her family.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong for not telling them. The options are A (yes, wrong) or B (no, not wrong). \n\nFirst, I need to consider her reasons. She left the family because of abuse and control. They haven't been in contact except for occasional hostile texts. She's afraid of their reaction to the pregnancy, especially since they might criticize her for being unmarried. Also, she's worried about her child being affected by the family's treatment.\n\nThe key points here are the history of abuse and the lack of communication. In cases where there's a pattern of abuse, estrangement is often necessary for the person's wellbeing. The family hasn't reached out in a healthy way, so her decision to not share personal news like a pregnancy could be seen as self-preservation. \n\nThe user is scared that if she tells them, the family will react negatively, and that could harm her child. She's already cut off from them because of their behavior, so hiding the pregnancy isn't about keeping it a secret from people who are part of her life, but from people who have been harmful. \n\nThe concept of \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) often hinges on societal norms, but in this case, the woman is protecting herself and her child from a toxic family. The fact that the family hasn't made efforts to maintain a positive relationship, and that they've been abusive, makes her position more understandable. \n\nSo, considering the context, the answer would be B (not in the wrong). She's not obligated to share information with people who have not been supportive and have a history of causing her harm. Her decision to prioritize her safety and her child's well-being is valid.\n"
