We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not telling her mom about the pregnancy. The situation is pretty detailed.\n\nFirst, the author ran away from home at 20 due to controlling and abusive family. The mom is described as narcissistic, and the grandfather as part of a cult-like family with extreme religious views. They controlled her life, invaded her privacy, etc. Now, she's pregnant, about 37 weeks along, and hasn't told her family. She's conflicted about whether she's doing the right thing by not informing them.\n\nThe key points here are the family's behavior towards her in the past. They haven't been in contact except for occasional hostile texts. She's worried they'll react negatively, blame her, and the baby might suffer. She's also considering the future impact on her child if the family meets her.\n\nSo, the question is whether she's in the wrong. Typically, when someone is in an abusive or toxic environment, their decisions are influenced by self-protection. The author has left that environment and built her own life. Not informing her family might be seen as cutting off contact, which could be justified given the history. However, there's also the aspect of the baby's family rights.\n\nBut considering the context, the family isn't supportive. They were abusive and controlling. If the author tells them, they might react in a harmful way, which could endanger her and the child. The author's reasons for not telling are based on protecting herself and her child from past trauma. That seems valid. \n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, if the family isn't part of her life, maybe she isn't obligated to inform them. However, if the child is born and the family could claim rights, there might be legal implications, but the question is about being in the wrong, not legal. Emotionally, she's conflicted, but her reasons are justified given the history. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. Her decision is based on protecting herself and her child from a harmful environment. The family's behavior justifies her choice to remain silent.\n"
