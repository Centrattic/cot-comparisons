We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not telling her mom she's pregnant. The situation is complicated.\n\nFirst, the author left home two years ago because her family was controlling and abusive. She's been living independently, found a partner, and is now pregnant. She hasn't told her family because she's afraid of their reaction\u2014narcissistic mom, controlling grandfather, religious cult-like environment. The last interactions were hostile when her family reached out to scream at her. \n\nThe author feels guilty for not telling them, but she's also scared they'll react badly\u2014maybe blame her for being unmarried, or worse, affect her child. She's worried her child might face the same treatment she did. The boyfriend hasn't pressured her, so she's on her own with this decision.\n\nSo, is she in the wrong? Well, family obligations can be tricky. If the family is abusive and she's in a better place now, maybe it's not her fault for not reaching out. They haven't been in contact except for hostile messages. The question is whether there's an obligation to inform family about such a life event, even if the relationship is toxic.\n\nOn one hand, some might say that family has a right to know, especially regarding a grandchild. On the other, if the family is harmful, protecting herself and the child is more important. The author has a valid fear based on past experiences. She's prioritizing safety and well-being. \n\nThe key points are the history of abuse, the family's behavior, and her current safe situation. The guilt she feels might be from societal expectations rather than the family's actions. Since they aren't in a healthy relationship, not sharing the news isn't necessarily wrong. She's not hiding it from a healthy relationship but avoiding potential harm.\n\nSo, answer B (not in the wrong) makes sense here. The author isn't at fault for protecting herself and her child from a harmful family dynamic.\n"
