We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not telling her mom about being pregnant. The situation is a bit complex. The author hasn't been in touch with her biological family for a long time, except for rare texts where they end up screaming at her. She left home at 20 due to a controlling, abusive environment. The family is described as narcissistic, religious, and controlling. The author is now pregnant, in a stable relationship, and considering whether to tell her family.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of their relationship. The author mentions that they're not on speaking terms, except for occasional texts that turn into arguments. She hasn't contacted them; they reach out. That's a big point. If there's no regular communication, is it really hiding? The definition of \"hiding\" might depend on the existing relationship dynamics. Since they don't speak and she avoids contact, not telling them could be seen as not sharing the news when there's no ongoing relationship. \n\nThen, the reasons for not telling them are valid. The family is abusive, controlling, and would likely react negatively. The author fears their reaction, and there's a concern about the child being affected by the family's behavior. The mother is a narcissist, and the grandfather runs the family like a cult. These are serious red flags. The author's priority is her own well-being and her child's safety, which is understandable. \n\nThe question of whether she's in the wrong comes down to intent and responsibility. She's not actively hiding it from someone she's in regular contact with. The family hasn't been part of her life, so withholding information might not be seen as wrong in this context. Additionally, the potential harm from revealing the pregnancy could be significant, given the family's history. \n\nThere's also the aspect of future consequences. The author is worried that her child might not have the chance to meet the other family. But if the family would be harmful to the child, preventing that contact might be protective. The author is making a decision based on her past experiences and the likelihood of negative outcomes.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that family ties are important and she should make an effort to reconnect. However, the situation isn't that straightforward. The family's behavior was abusive, and the author has valid reasons for not wanting to engage with them. The question is about whether she's in the wrong, not just the practicality of the decision.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
