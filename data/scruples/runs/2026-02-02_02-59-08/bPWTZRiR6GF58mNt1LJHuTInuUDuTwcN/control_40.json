We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong for not telling her mom about being pregnant.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author left her family due to controlling, abusive parents and a cult-like environment. She's now in a stable relationship, pregnant, and hasn't told her family. They don't communicate much except for occasional hostile texts.\n\nThe key points here are the history of abuse and control. The family's behavior was so bad that she felt compelled to leave. The question is about whether she's in the wrong for not informing them now. \n\nFrom a typical perspective, one might think that family should be informed about a pregnancy. But in this case, the family isn't part of her life anymore, and there's a history of abuse. The author's reasons for not telling them are rooted in self-protection and the baby's well-being. She's worried about the family's reaction and potential harm to her child.\n\nThe concept of \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) often involves social norms, but in cases involving abuse, the norms might not apply. The author's decision isn't about secrecy for no reason but rather avoiding harm from a toxic family. \n\nHer boyfriend hasn't pressured her, which suggests support. She's also considering the child's future. The fear of the family's reaction and the potential for the child to be negatively affected adds weight to her decision.\n\nI think the answer here is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). She has valid reasons related to her past trauma and the well-being of her child. The family isn't part of her life, so withholding information isn't hiding it from a relationship but from people who have been harmful. It's about protecting herself and her child from potential abuse or control.\n"
