We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not telling their mom about the pregnancy. The situation is pretty complex.\n\nFirst, the author ran away from home at 20 because of a controlling, abusive family. The mom is described as a narcissist, and the grandfather as running a cult-like family. They were super controlling, invading privacy, and pushing religion. The author left, found a stable life, got into a relationship, and is now pregnant. They haven't told their family, and the family only contacts them to yell. The author is scared of the family's reaction, potential harassment, and not wanting their child to be treated the same way.\n\nThe user initially thought the author is in the wrong but wants a second opinion. The question is whether not telling the family makes the author wrong. \n\nSo, to decide between A and B. In most cultures, there's an expectation to inform family about a pregnancy, especially parents. But the context here is crucial. The family isn't a supportive one; they're abusive. The author has valid reasons to fear contact. The family isn't part of the author's life anymore, so the lack of communication isn't the author's fault. Also, the author is protecting their child from a toxic environment. \n\nThe key points: The family initiated contact, but it's hostile. The author isn't hiding the pregnancy from someone they have a relationship with; the family has cut themselves off. The author's decision is to protect their well-being and their child's. So, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. They're prioritizing safety and mental health. The guilt might come from societal expectations, but the family's behavior is the main issue here. So the answer would be B.\n"
