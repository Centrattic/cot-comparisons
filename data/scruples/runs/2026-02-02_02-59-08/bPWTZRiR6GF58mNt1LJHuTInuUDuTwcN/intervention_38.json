We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is 37 weeks pregnant and hasn't told their biological family. They had a very abusive upbringing with a controlling mother and a family that's religious and cult-like. They ran away at 20 and haven't been in contact except for rare texts that escalate into arguments.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for not telling their mom about the pregnancy. The user initially thought the author is in the wrong but wants to know my take.\n\nFirst, family obligations vs. personal safety. The family isn't supportive; they've been abusive and controlling. The author left because of that. If they tell them, it's likely to be met with hostility, criticism (like being unmarried), and possibly harm to the child. The author's priority is protecting themselves and their baby, which is understandable.\n\nGuilt comes from feeling like they should share this news, but if the family isn't part of their life and they can't handle the potential fallout, is it their responsibility to inform them? The author's reasoning is valid\u2014maintaining distance for safety. The boyfriend hasn't pressured them, so there's no external pressure to tell.\n\nAlso, the family's history of invasion of privacy and control makes it even more risky to disclose. The author might fear for their child's well-being if the family gets involved. So, while there's a natural inclination to feel guilty about not sharing such a major life event, the context of abuse complicates things.\n\nIn terms of moral obligation, if the family isn't part of their life and has been harmful, the author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing their safety and the child's. They're not hiding it in a deceptive way if contact is minimal. It's more about protecting themselves from harm. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
