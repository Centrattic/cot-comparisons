We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not telling her mom about her pregnancy. The situation is pretty detailed. The author ran away from home at 20 due to a controlling, abusive family. The mom is described as narcissistic, and the family is extremely controlling and religious. They invade privacy, control finances, and so on. Now, the author is pregnant, in a stable relationship, and hasn't told her family. She's conflicted because she feels guilty but is scared of their reaction and the potential harm to her child.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if there's a moral obligation to inform family about a pregnancy. The key points here are the family's behavior. Since they're abusive and controlling, not telling them might protect both the author and the child from further harm. The author hasn't had contact except for rare, hostile messages. So, in that context, is she in the wrong?\n\nThe user is asking for an answer between A (yes, wrong) or B (no, not wrong). The arguments for B: the family has a history of abuse, so contacting them could be dangerous. The author is protecting herself and the child. The arguments for A: family has a right to know about a grandchild. But given the circumstances, the negative aspects of the family's behavior outweigh the obligation. Also, the author's family isn't maintaining any healthy contact. \n\nThe author mentions her boyfriend hasn't pressured her, and she's afraid of their reaction, like being called nasty names for being unmarried. The potential for the child being harmed by the family's treatment is also a factor. So, the decision not to tell could be seen as a protective measure. \n\nIn such cases, where there's a history of abuse, many would argue that cutting off contact is the right choice. The author isn't hiding it from someone who's actively part of her life; they haven't been in contact. So, it's not about hiding but choosing not to engage with toxic family members. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
