We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for not telling her mom about being pregnant. The situation is pretty detailed.\n\nFirst, the author has a strained relationship with her family. They were controlling and abusive, leading her to run away at 20. Now she's pregnant and hasn't told them. The family only contacts her to scream, not out of genuine care. She's worried about their reaction and the potential impact on her child.\n\nI need to consider both sides. Legally or socially, there's no obligation to inform family unless there's a custody arrangement, which there isn't here. The family isn't involved in her life, so maybe it's not her responsibility. She's protecting herself and the child from potential harm. On the flip side, some might say there's a moral obligation, but given the history, that's debatable.\n\nThe key factors are the family's behavior: controlling, abusive, and the risk they pose. The author left the family situation for a reason. By not contacting them, she's maintaining boundaries, which is healthy. The fear of their reaction and the child being affected are valid concerns. The author isn't hiding it from an active relationship but from estranged, toxic family. So, she's not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
