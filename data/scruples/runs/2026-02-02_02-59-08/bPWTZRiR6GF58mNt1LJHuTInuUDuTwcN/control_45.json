We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for not telling their mom about being pregnant.\n\nFirst, the situation: the author ran away from home at 20 due to a controlling, abusive family. The mom is a narcissist, and the family is extremely religious and controlling, invading privacy. Now the author is pregnant and hasn't told any family members. They haven't spoken to the family except for occasional texts that turn into arguments. The author is scared of how the family will react\u2014likely with anger, judgment, and maybe trying to control the situation. The author is also worried about the baby's future if the family is involved.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is at fault for not informing their family. Let me think about the key points here. In many cultures, there's an expectation to inform family members about major life events like a pregnancy. But this isn't a one-size-fits-all situation. The author's family has a history of abuse and control, which is a significant factor. If the family is toxic and the author has legitimate reasons to fear their reaction, then not telling them could be a protective measure.\n\nThe author mentions feeling guilty but justifies it by the lack of communication and the potential harm. The family hasn't been supportive; instead, they've been harassing. The author has built a life independently and is in a healthy relationship. The main concern is the well-being of the author and the child. If the family is likely to cause emotional distress or try to interfere, then the author has a right to protect themselves. \n\nHowever, some might argue that family should be part of your life, and cutting them out entirely might be seen as neglecting responsibility. But considering the abuse history, most ethical perspectives would support prioritizing one's mental health and the child's safety. There's no legal obligation to inform family about a pregnancy, especially if there's a history of harm. \n\nThe author's fear of the family's reaction\u2014labeling them as a liar, making negative comments about being unmarried, and potentially mistreating the child\u2014is valid. The author is not in the wrong for choosing to protect themselves and their unborn child from a harmful environment. The guilt they feel is understandable, but it's balanced by their justified fear and the need for safety. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The situation is complex, but the author's actions are a form of self-preservation and protection, which is entirely reasonable given the circumstances.\n"
