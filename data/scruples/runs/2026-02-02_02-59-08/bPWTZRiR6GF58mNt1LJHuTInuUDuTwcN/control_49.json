I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell.

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for not telling her mom about being pregnant. Let me break down the details.\n\nThe author is 37 weeks pregnant, which is almost at term. She hasn't told her biological family, which includes her mom, grandfather, and others. The family has a history of being controlling and abusive. She ran away at 20 because of that. The family is described as extremely controlling, invasive, and religious. They haven't been in contact except for occasional texts that turn into screaming matches where they yell at her for not checking in.\n\nShe's worried about telling them now because of how they might react. She's scared they'll accuse her of hiding things, being a liar, and judge her for being unmarried. Also, she's concerned about her child being affected by the family's treatment. The boyfriend hasn't pushed her to tell, but she feels guilty for not doing it.\n\nSo the main question is whether she's in the wrong for not informing her family. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The family's behavior is clearly toxic and abusive. The author left because of the control and abuse. If someone has a toxic family and chooses not to engage with them, especially for their own well-being and their child's, it's hard to say they're in the wrong. The responsibility isn't on the child to maintain contact with abusive parents. In fact, protecting herself and her child from potential harm is a valid reason to not inform them.\n\nHowever, some might argue that not telling the family could be seen as a refusal to share a major life event, which might be considered cutting them out entirely. But given the family's history, the author's actions are more about self-preservation. The family hasn't been supportive, and their interactions are hostile. The author's fear is justified based on past experiences. She's also considering the well-being of her child, fearing that exposure to the family could lead to similar treatment.\n\nThe key points here are the family's abusive behavior, the lack of positive communication, and the author's valid fears. The family initiated contact with negativity, not the author. Choosing not to share such news in that context isn't a moral failing but a protective measure. Therefore, the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
