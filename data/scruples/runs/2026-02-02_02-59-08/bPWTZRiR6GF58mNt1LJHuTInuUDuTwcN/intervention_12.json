We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not telling her mom about her pregnancy. The situation is complex. The author left her family two years ago because they were controlling and abusive. The family is described as narcissistic, religious, and controlling. She's now with her boyfriend and pregnant, and hasn't told her family yet.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author's family hasn't been supportive, and their interactions are hostile. She left because of abuse, so maintaining contact isn't a given. The question is whether she's obligated to tell her family about her pregnancy now.\n\nThe user initially thought the author is in the wrong but wants to know the perspective. The choices are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFrom the author's perspective, not telling her family isn't about hiding the pregnancy from them but avoiding the negative consequences she anticipates. She's protecting herself and her child from potential harm. Since the family hasn't reached out except to yell, and they've been abusive, her decision might be justified as self-preservation.\n\nBut others might argue that family has a right to know about their grandchild, even if the relationship is strained. However, the key points here are the history of abuse, the lack of genuine communication, and the potential harm to her child. The author is prioritizing her safety and her child's well-being.\n\nSo, based on the information, the author isn't in the wrong. Her decision is influenced by past trauma and protecting her new family from an unhealthy environment. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
