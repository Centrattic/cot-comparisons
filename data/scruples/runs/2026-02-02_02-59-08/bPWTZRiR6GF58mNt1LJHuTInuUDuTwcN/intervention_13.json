We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not telling her mom about her pregnancy. The situation is complex.\n\nFirst, the author hasn't spoken to her family in a while except for occasional texts that turn into arguments. They left home at 20 due to a controlling, abusive family. The mom is a narcissist, and the grandfather runs the family like a cult. They were extremely controlling, invading privacy, and pushing religion. The author now has a stable life, a partner, and is pregnant but hasn't told her family.\n\nThe question is whether not telling them makes her in the wrong. The author feels guilty but is scared of their reaction. She's worried about her daughter's future if they meet them. The boyfriend hasn't pressured her to tell them.\n\nI need to consider ethical perspectives. On one hand, family relationships can be important, and witholding such a big life event might be seen as cutting off contact. But on the other hand, the family was abusive and manipulative. The author might be protecting herself and her child from harm. Legally, there's no obligation to inform parents about a pregnancy if there's no ongoing relationship. Ethically, if the family isn't supportive or safe, not telling them could be justified as self-preservation.\n\nThe author is prioritizing her mental health and her child's safety. The \"ITA\" (If This is a) question hinges on whether the action is inconsiderate. However, given the context of abuse and lack of communication, it's reasonable to see this as a protective measure. The author isn't hiding it from someone who maintains a healthy relationship; it's more about avoiding contact with toxic family members. So, she might not be in the wrong.\n"
