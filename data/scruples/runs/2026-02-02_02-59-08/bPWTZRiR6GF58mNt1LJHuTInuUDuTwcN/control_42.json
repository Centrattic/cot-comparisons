We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong for not telling her mom about being pregnant. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is 37 weeks pregnant, so almost ready to give birth. She hasn't told her biological family because they aren't on speaking terms except for occasional texts that turn into screaming. The family is described as controlling, abusive, with a narcissistic mother and a grandfather who runs the family like a cult. The author ran away at 20 due to this environment.\n\nShe's worried about how they'll react if she tells them. They might accuse her of hiding it, lying, and being bad for being unmarried. She's also concerned about her baby being affected by her family. The boyfriend hasn't pushed her to tell them. The main conflict is her guilt over not telling versus the fear of their reaction.\n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong. The key factors here are the family dynamics. They were abusive and controlling, leading her to leave home. If she's not in contact with them and they only reach out to harass her, then not sharing the news might be a protective measure. \n\nIn cases where someone has cut off a toxic or abusive family, it's often considered understandable to not want to engage further. The author is prioritizing her well-being and her child's safety. The family hasn't maintained a healthy relationship, so the responsibility isn't on her to inform them. The guilt she feels might be from societal expectations, but her situation is specific and difficult. \n\nAlso, the last time the family reached out, it was harassment, so she's right to avoid giving them the chance to react. Her decision to not tell them is self-protective and in the best interest of her child. Therefore, the answer would be B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
