We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the given situation is in the wrong for not telling her mom she's pregnant. The author hasn't told her family because she had a bad experience with them, including controlling behavior, abuse, and being part of a cult-like family. She ran away at 20 and is now pregnant with her boyfriend's child.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if she's in the wrong. The question is about moral responsibility, not legal. The key points here are her past with the family, their controlling nature, and her fear of how they might react. The mother's potential reaction includes accusations of hiding the pregnancy, criticizing her for being unmarried, and possible negative treatment of her child. The author is scared her child might face the same abuse she did.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, family ties can be important, but so is protecting oneself and one's child from harm. If the family is genuinely abusive and unresponsive, it's understandable she wouldn't want to involve them. The fact that contact is minimal and hostile supports her decision to avoid them. The boyfriend hasn't pressured her, so there's no external pressure from him. Her reasons are based on self-preservation and the child's well-being.\n\nHowever, some might argue that family connections are important and that she should try to maintain some level of contact. But given the history of abuse and the lack of positive interaction, it's more about protecting her current life and child. The guilt she feels is valid, but her actions are a response to justified fear. The answer would likely be B, she's not in the wrong because the circumstances justify her decision to keep it secret.\n"
