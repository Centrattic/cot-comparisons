We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not telling her mom she's pregnant. The situation is complex. The author ran away from home at 20 due to a controlling, abusive family environment. The mom is described as narcissistic, and the family is controlling to the point of checking car mileage, controlling bank accounts, invading privacy, etc. Now, the author is pregnant, and hasn't told her family, who they don't speak to except for rare texts that turn into arguments.\n\nThe author is conflicted: she feels guilty for hiding it, but given the family's history, she's terrified of the reaction. She's also worried about her child being exposed to that toxic environment. The boyfriend hasn't pressured her to tell them, but she's struggling with guilt.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. The user initially thought she is, but wants others' opinions. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, consider the context of the family dynamics. The author left due to abuse. The family hasn't been supportive, and their interactions are hostile. From that perspective, not sharing the news isn't about hiding but protecting herself and her child from harm. The family hasn't shown they can be supportive or respectful. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that family ties are important, and cutting them off completely might be cutting the child off from relatives. But given the family's behavior, the author is prioritizing the well-being of her child and herself. The key here is the definition of \"hiding.\" If the family hasn't reached out consistently and their communication is toxic, then it's not hiding. Also, the author is in a stable situation now, which suggests she's made a good choice in distancing herself.\n\nIn terms of guilt, the author is feeling it, but guilt can be situational. If the family is not a safe environment, withholding information isn't wrong. The priority is the safety and mental health of the author and child. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). She's making a choice based on her past experiences to avoid harm, which is understandable and necessary for her and her child's well-being.\n"
