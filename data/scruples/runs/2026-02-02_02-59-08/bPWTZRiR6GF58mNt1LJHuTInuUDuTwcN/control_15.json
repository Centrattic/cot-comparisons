We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not telling her mom about being pregnant. The situation is pretty complicated.\n\nFirst, the author ran away from home at 20 because of a controlling, abusive family. Her mom is described as a narcissistic parent, and the family is extremely religious and controlling. They cut off contact unless they randomly text to yell at her. Now she's pregnant, almost 37 weeks, and hasn't told them. Her boyfriend hasn't pushed her to tell, but she feels conflicted. She's scared of their reaction, worried they'll say she's hiding it, and she's also concerned about her baby's future with them.\n\nSo, the key points here are the abuse and control she experienced. If she's in a situation where contacting her family would put her or her child at risk, then not telling them might be a protective measure. The family's behavior sounds toxic and potentially harmful. They already have a history of harassment and invasion of privacy. The author left that environment to be free, and now she's building a life with her partner. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, she's not in the wrong if the decision is based on protecting herself and her child from abuse. The family hasn't reached out in a healthy way, only to criticize. There's no indication that they've changed or that she's in a position to trust them again. The guilt she feels might be from societal expectations, but her safety and her child's well-being come first. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because she's protecting herself and her child from a harmful environment. The decision to not tell them isn't about hiding, but about avoiding potential harm. The family's actions and her past experiences justify her choice.\n"
