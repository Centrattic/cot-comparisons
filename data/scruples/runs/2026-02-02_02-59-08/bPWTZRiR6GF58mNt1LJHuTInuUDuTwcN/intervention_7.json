We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not telling her mom she's pregnant. The situation is pretty detailed. The woman left her family because of controlling and abusive behavior. Her mom is described as a narcissist, and the family is extremely religious and controlling. She's been estranged for a while, with only rare, negative contact. Now she's pregnant and hasn't told them, but feels guilty about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of the estrangement. If the family was abusive and controlling, not contacting them might be a form of self-preservation. The author left because of the abuse, so maintaining distance could be necessary for her well-being and her child's.\n\nThe question is whether not telling them makes her in the wrong. The key factors here are the nature of the relationship. If there's no regular contact, and the family has a history of abuse, then withholding the information isn't hiding\u2014it's a choice to protect herself. The family hasn't asked or shown up in her life in a positive way, so the responsibility isn't on her to inform them. Plus, there's the concern about the baby's future, which is a valid worry given the family's behavior.\n\nThe author feels guilty, which is common in such situations. But guilt here might stem from societal expectations rather than actual wrongdoing. The family's actions were harmful, so the author isn't obligated to share personal news with them. The answer would likely be B, not in the wrong, because the context of abuse and estrangement justifies her decision to keep it private. The key is that the relationship is already broken, and she's protecting herself and the child from potential harm.\n"
