We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not telling her mom she's pregnant. The situation is that the author left home two years ago due to a controlling, abusive family environment. Her mom is described as narcissistic, and the family is extremely religious and controlling, even to the point of monitoring her every move when she was younger.\n\nSo the author hasn't spoken to her family in a while, only occasional texts that turn into arguments. She's now pregnant with her boyfriend's child and hasn't told her family. She's torn because she feels guilty but is scared of their reaction. The family might disapprove because she's not married, and she's worried about how they might treat her child. The key question is whether she's in the wrong for not telling them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The family wasn't proactive in maintaining a healthy relationship. The author left because of abuse, which is a valid reason. The family's behavior is toxic, so their right to know might be weighed against the potential harm from informing them. Also, since they haven't been in contact, the responsibility to inform might not be on her, especially if they haven't shown any interest in a real relationship.\n\nThere's also the aspect of the child's future. The author is concerned about her child being exposed to the same toxic environment. That's a valid parental concern. The mother is trying to protect her child from potential harm, which is a strong point in her favor.\n\nLegally, there might be obligations, but emotionally and ethically, the situation is more about the well-being of the mother and child. The fact that the family has a history of abuse and control suggests that contact might not be in the child's best interest. The author is making a choice based on her past experiences and current understanding of her family's behavior.\n\nThe boyfriend hasn't pressured her, so there's no external pressure from him. The author's decision is based on her own fears and past experiences. Since the family hasn't made efforts to maintain a positive relationship, the author isn't neglecting her duty to inform them if there's no real communication.\n\nIn many cases, when a family is estranged due to abuse, the choice to remain silent is seen as self-preservation. The author is prioritizing her child's safety and her own mental health. Therefore, she's not in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
