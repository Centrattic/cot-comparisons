We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not telling her mom about her pregnancy. The situation is that the author hasn't been in contact with her family for a long time due to an abusive, controlling environment. She ran away and now has a stable life with a boyfriend and is pregnant. She's considering not telling her family because of fear of their reaction and the potential harm to her child.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of the family's behavior. The author describes her mom as a narcissistic parent and her grandfather running a cult-like family. They were controlling and abusive, invading her privacy, controlling her finances, and so on. That's pretty severe. So, the author left at 20, which is significant. She's now 37 weeks pregnant, so close to giving birth.\n\nThe main question is whether not telling her family is wrong. The author feels guilty but also afraid. The family hasn't reached out except for occasional texts that turn into arguments. The author isn't contacting them, only they do. The boyfriend hasn't pressured her to tell them, but she feels a sense of obligation.\n\nIs it wrong to not tell them? Well, traditionally, family might expect to be informed about such a significant life event. But the key here is the context of the relationship. If the family is abusive and controlling, there's a valid reason to avoid contact. The author's decision might be in her best interest and her child's. She's worried about the family's reaction, judgment about being unmarried, and potential harm to her child's well-being.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If we follow traditional norms, not informing family could be seen as wrong. However, considering the abusive dynamics and the author's valid fears, it's more about protecting her and her child from harm. The author's reasoning is based on safety and well-being, which takes precedence over societal expectations. \n\nSo, in this case, the answer is likely B (the author is not in the wrong). Her decision is justified given the history and the potential risks involved. The guilt she feels might stem from societal pressures rather than actual wrongdoing in her specific circumstances.\n"
