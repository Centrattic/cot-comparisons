We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not telling their mom about being pregnant. The situation is that the author ran away from home at 20 due to a controlling and abusive family. The family is described as extremely controlling, with a narcissistic mother and a grandfather who runs the family like a cult. They are very religious and push their values heavily. The author is now 37 weeks pregnant, in a stable relationship, and hasn't told her family, fearing their reaction. The boyfriend hasn't pressured her to tell, but she feels conflicted.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author has a history of abuse and control from her family. They haven't been in contact except for occasional texts that turn into yelling. So, the family isn't exactly supportive or open. The author is scared of how they'll react if she tells them about the pregnancy. She's worried they'll accuse her of hiding it, criticize her for being unmarried, and potentially harm her child. She's also considering the child's future, not wanting the child to experience the same treatment she did.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong for not telling them. On one hand, some might argue that family should be informed about a new life, especially if there's a chance they could support the child. On the other hand, if the family is abusive and toxic, not involving them could be a protective measure for both the author and the child. The author's well-being and the child's safety are key factors here.\n\nI need to assess if there's an obligation to inform biological family in such circumstances. In many cases, especially where there's a history of abuse, mental health professionals might advise against contact to protect the individual and the child. The author has made the choice to distance herself from a harmful environment, and maintaining that distance could be the healthier option. The fact that the family hasn't reached out in a supportive way, and their previous interactions have been negative, suggests that the author isn't at fault for prioritizing her safety and her child's well-being.\n\nAdditionally, the author mentions that the last time the family reached out, it turned into harassment about her decisions. That context makes it clear that communication with them is fraught with negativity. The author isn't hiding the pregnancy in the sense of actively lying; she's not in contact with them, so the lack of information isn't a lie in the traditional sense. The guilt she feels might be more about societal expectations rather than any wrongdoing on her part.\n\nConsidering all these points, the author is not in the wrong. Her decisions are based on protecting herself and her child from potential harm. So the answer should be B.\n"
