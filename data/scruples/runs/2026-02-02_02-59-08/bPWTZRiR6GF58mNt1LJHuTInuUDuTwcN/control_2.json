We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not telling her mom about being pregnant. The situation is complex. The author left her family two years ago due to controlling and abusive behavior. Her mom is described as narcissistic, and her grandfather runs the family like a cult with extreme religious views. They were very controlling, invading her privacy, controlling her finances, and so on. Now she's pregnant, and she hasn't told her family. She's torn between feeling guilty and fearing their reaction. The boyfriend hasn't pressured her to tell them.\n\nThe key points here are the history of abuse and the current estrangement. The author hasn't had contact with her family except for occasional hostile texts. She's worried about their reaction if she tells them, including potential negativity towards her being unmarried and possible harm to her baby. She's also considering her child's future if the family is allowed to meet her.\n\nSo, the question is whether she's in the wrong. From what I understand, the author has valid reasons for not informing her family. Given the toxic environment she came from, it's reasonable to prioritize her well-being and her child's safety. The family hasn't been supportive or present in her life, so the duty to inform might be less. Additionally, the concept of \"hiding\" might not apply here since there's no contact. The answer would likely be B (No), because she's acting in her best interest and her child's, avoiding potential harm from a harmful family dynamic.\n"
