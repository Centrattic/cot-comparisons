We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong for not telling her mom she's pregnant. The user initially thought the author is in the wrong but wants to know my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author is 37 weeks pregnant, so the due date is soon. She hasn't told her biological family, except for the occasional contact where they end up screaming at her. She ran away from home at 20 due to a controlling, mentally abusive family environment. Her mom is described as a narcissistic parent, and the grandfather is running the family like a cult with extreme religious views. The family controlled her life before she left, invading her privacy and being abusive.\n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong for not informing them. The user says they haven't pressured her, but she feels some guilt. She's worried about how they'll react, being blamed for hiding it, and the potential negative impact on her child if the family meets her.\n\nFrom a typical moral standpoint, sometimes people feel obligated to inform family members about major life events like pregnancy. But this isn't a one-size-fits-all scenario. The key here is the nature of the family relationship. If the family is abusive and toxic, the author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing her well-being and her baby's. The user's initial thought is that she's in the wrong, but maybe they didn't consider the abusive dynamics as much.\n\nI should consider the following points: the family's history of abuse, the lack of a healthy relationship, the potential harm to the author and her child, and the fact that she's in a stable situation now. The author isn't avoiding responsibility; she's protecting herself and her child from an environment that's not safe. In such cases, it's reasonable to cut off contact or keep personal news private. The guilt might come from societal expectations, but her decision is based on self-preservation and protecting her child from possible harm.\n\nSo, the answer should be B (No), the author is not in the wrong. Her decision is justified given the family's behavior and the desire to shield her child from a harmful environment. The moral wrong isn't in withholding information from those who have already shown to be abusive and controlling.\n"
