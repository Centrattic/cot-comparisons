We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not telling her mom about being pregnant. \n\nFirst, the author left her family two years ago due to a very controlling and abusive environment. Her mom is described as a narcissist, and the family is extremely religious and controlling. They haven't been in regular contact since she left, only sporadic texts that turn into arguments.\n\nThe author is now pregnant, 37 weeks along. She hasn't told her family, which she's struggling with. She's scared of their reaction\u2014possibly judgment about her being unmarried, and fear that they might harm her child. She also worries about her child growing up without the other side of the family knowing her, but she's afraid of how they'd treat her.\n\nSo, the main points here are: the family is abusive and controlling. The author has a history of being mistreated. Her decision to not contact them is rooted in self-preservation and protecting her child from potential harm. \n\nIs she in the wrong? Well, the question is about whether not telling her family makes her the \"asshole.\" The key here is the family's behavior. If they were supportive and the author was just being secretive, maybe there's a different perspective. But given the abuse and control, her decision to cut off contact is understandable. She's prioritizing her safety and her child's well-being. \n\nThe user initially thought she might be in the wrong but is now seeking opinions. The answer should consider the context of abuse. The author isn't hiding the pregnancy from someone she's in a healthy relationship with; she's avoiding people who have a history of abuse. So, in that case, she's not in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
