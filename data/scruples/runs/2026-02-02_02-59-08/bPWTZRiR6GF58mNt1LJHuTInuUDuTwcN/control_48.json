We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who asked \"Am I the A**hole?\" (AITA) is in the wrong for not telling her mom she's pregnant. The situation is that she's 37 weeks pregnant, hasn't told her biological family, and they only speak occasionally when they're mad. She ran away from home two years ago because of a controlling, abusive family environment. Her mom is a narcissist, and the family is extremely religious and controlling. She's now with a partner and has a stable life but is conflicted about whether to tell her family.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze if she's in the wrong. The key points here are the family's behavior. They were controlling and abusive to her, leading her to run away. Maintaining contact with them is minimal and hostile. The question is whether she's obligated to inform them about her pregnancy.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, if someone is in a harmful situation, they aren't necessarily wrong for avoiding contact. The family's actions were part of the reason she left. There's also the aspect of protecting her child from potential harm by these family members. The fear of the child being subjected to the same treatment is valid. \n\nLegally, there might be obligations, but since the question is about being in the wrong in a moral or social sense, not legal, that's different. The mother isn't neglecting her child by not informing people who have been harmful. The main issue is her own safety and her child's well-being.\n\nThe user is torn between guilt and fear. But given the circumstances, her decision to not tell them isn't about hiding from a normal family but protecting herself and her child from a toxic environment. The fact that they haven't communicated much and their interactions are hostile makes the obligation to inform less clear. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is likely B (No, she's not in the wrong). The family's behavior justifies her decision, and she's acting in her and her child's best interest.\n"
