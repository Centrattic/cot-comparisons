We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for not telling her mom about being pregnant. The situation is pretty complex.\n\nFirst, the author left her family two years ago because of controlling and abusive behavior. Her mom is a narcissist, and the family is very strict with their religious views. They were controlling her life in extreme ways. Now she's pregnant with her boyfriend's child and hasn't told her family. She's worried about their reaction\u2014maybe they'll be angry she's not married, or they might harm her child. She's considering never telling them but feels guilty.\n\nSo, the main question is whether she's in the wrong. Well, in terms of responsibility, if the family hasn't reached out to her, maybe she isn't obligated to inform them. They've been abusive, and she's made a life separate from them. The fact that they haven't maintained a relationship might mean that the onus isn't on her to share every life update. Also, protecting her child from a potentially harmful family environment is a valid concern. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that family should be informed, but given the history, keeping them out might be the healthier choice. The author's reasons are rooted in self-protection and her child's well-being. The guilt she feels is understandable, but if the family hasn't made efforts to maintain a relationship, maybe she isn't in the wrong for not sharing the news. The key points are the abuse history, lack of communication from the family, and the potential harm to the child. So, probably answer B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
