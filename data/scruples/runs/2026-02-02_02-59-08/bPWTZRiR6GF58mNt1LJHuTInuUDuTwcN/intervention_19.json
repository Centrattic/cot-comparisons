We aren't on speaking terms except for the very rare occasional \"are you alive\" text that somehow turns into them screaming at me for leaving. I never contact them - they reach out to me.\n\nAbout 2 years ago, I ran away from home (I was 20 at that time) because my family was incredibly controlling and mentally abusive. My mother is the dictionary definition of a narcissistic parent and my grandfather runs the family like a cult. They are extremely religious and push their values on anyone they meet to a crazy extent. They controlled every aspect of my life for the twenty years that I lived in my mother's house. I'm talking reading the miles on my car to make sure I was only travelling to school and back, controlling my bank account to make sure I could only spend on gas, and constantly invading my phone messages, emails, and other privacy to confront me about what friends would say, what I would say, etc. I left, found a stable job and a home, fell in love with someone who makes me genuinely happy, and here I am pregnant with his child.\n\nMy boyfriend hasn't pressured me to tell them, but for some reason I feel that I should. I know I'm terrified of telling them due to how I know they'll react. I guess I feel guilty though for hiding it, but is it hiding if we haven't talked for months? I know they'll say that I hid it, that I lied about it by not bringing it up the last time they decided to harrass me about my decision, that I'm all kinds of nasty things for being unmarried. I don't know if I can honestly handle that. And then what about my baby? I wonder if she will hate me later for my half of the family not knowing of her existence or her not getting the choice to meet them. I'm scared of how they would treat her if given the opportunity. I don't want them to face the same treatment I got growing up.\n\nThis has been sitting on my mind, so I figured I'd ask. It feels wrong not telling them, but I'm honestly afraid to tell. AITA if I just never tell them?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not telling her mom about being pregnant. The situation is that the author has a bad relationship with her family, who were controlling and abusive. She ran away and now is pregnant with her boyfriend's child. She hasn't told her family yet because she's scared of their reaction and doesn't want her child to go through the same treatment.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The family isn't in regular contact; they only reach out occasionally and it's hostile. The author left to escape abuse. If she hasn't communicated with them in a while, maybe there's no obligation to update them. Also, she's protecting her child from potential harm from an abusive family. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that family has a right to know, especially if there's a grandchild involved. But in this case, the family's history is toxic. The author is prioritizing her safety and her child's well-being. \n\nThe guilt she feels might be because society often emphasizes family bonds, but her situation is specific. The key points are the abusive environment and her decision to leave. If telling them would endanger her or her child, it's reasonable not to. So, she's not in the wrong for protecting herself and her baby. The answer should be B.\n"
