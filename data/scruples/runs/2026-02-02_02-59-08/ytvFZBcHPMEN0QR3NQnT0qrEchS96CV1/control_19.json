He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The question revolves around whether it's acceptable for the author to lose attraction after finding out their crush is trans. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. The author and the trans person were friends for months, developed a romantic relationship, and the author didn't know about the person's trans status until the moment they were about to have sex. The author feels like they were lied to because the trans person didn't disclose earlier. The author is straight, so they're not attracted to vaginas, hence the attraction fading. The trans person is upset and accused the author of being manipulative, which the author finds hurtful.\n\nNow, the key points here are consent, disclosure, and attraction. The trans person didn't disclose their gender identity before the relationship became sexual. The author argues that this information was important, and the trans person had time to share it. However, it's also important to note that gender identity is a personal matter, and individuals aren't obligated to disclose it unless it's relevant. But in the context of a romantic relationship, especially when it's becoming sexual, there's an expectation of honesty.\n\nThe author's reaction is based on their sexual orientation. They're not attracted to vaginas, so the revelation changed their feelings. That's a personal preference, but the trans person might have felt that their identity should be respected regardless of the outcome. The author might feel they were misled, but the trans person might feel that the author's focus on genitalia is problematic.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't in the wrong for not being attracted to a vagina. Sexual orientation is a valid aspect of a person's identity. However, the author should consider whether the trans person had the right to withhold such personal information. But given that the author didn't know, and the trans person might have felt vulnerable about disclosing, it's a complex situation. The author's decision to end the relationship isn't malicious but based on their own feelings. The trans person's anger might stem from feeling rejected after disclosing their identity. However, the author isn't the one who withheld information; the trans person did. So, the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
