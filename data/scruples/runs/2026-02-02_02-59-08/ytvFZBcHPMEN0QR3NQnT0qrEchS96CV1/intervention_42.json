He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong after finding out their crush is trans and losing attraction. The author is asking if they're an asshole for ending the relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author and their crush became close friends, developed a romantic relationship, and were engaging in intimate activities. The author discovered the crush is trans during a moment of physical intimacy. They feel lied to because the crush didn't disclose this earlier. The author is straight and not attracted to vaginas, so the attraction faded. The crush is upset and accused the author of being evil and manipulative.\n\nNow, considering the ethical and social aspects. Being trans is a significant part of someone's identity. The crush may have been waiting for the right time to come out, perhaps due to fear of rejection or past experiences. However, the author is also dealing with their own feelings and boundaries. They might feel that the lack of disclosure affects their ability to consent properly to the relationship, especially regarding physical intimacy.\n\nThe author's main argument is about honesty and transparency. They believe that the crush should have revealed their trans status earlier. On the other hand, the crush might have felt vulnerable and unsure about how the author would react. The author is also facing internal conflict about their attraction and identity, which is valid. It's possible they're struggling with whether their reaction is based on genuine attraction or societal conditioning.\n\nIn terms of the author's actions, they ended the romantic relationship but want to stay friends. They didn't express their feelings of being lied to upfront, which might have caused the crush to feel blindsided. The author's sudden loss of attraction could be seen as a personal choice, not necessarily malicious. However, the way the information was revealed might have been handled more sensitively. The author's reaction might stem from a place of confusion rather than malice.\n\nThe crush's anger and accusations suggest they might feel betrayed or rejected, which is understandable if they were finally being open about their identity. However, calling the author evil and manipulative is extreme and not a healthy way to process the situation. That might indicate the crush is struggling with their own emotions, possibly projecting their hurt onto the author.\n\nIn conclusion, whether the author is in the wrong depends on the perspective. They might not be malicious, but the situation shows a breakdown in communication on both sides. The author could have addressed their concerns earlier, but the crush not disclosing earlier also plays a role. The key here is mutual respect and understanding. The author's decision to end the relationship isn't inherently wrong if they're not attracted, but the way they handled it could have been more compassionate. However, since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, considering their intent and the circumstances, it's a complex situation. I think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong, because they're acting on their genuine feelings and boundaries, even if the method could have been better. But I need to check if there's any ethical obligation here. Since the crush didn't disclose, but the author also has valid feelings, it's a tough call. I lean towards B.\n"
