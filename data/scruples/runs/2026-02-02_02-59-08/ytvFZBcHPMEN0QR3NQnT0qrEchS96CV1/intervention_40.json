He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the AskReddit-style question is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is a straight guy who found out his crush is trans, and his attraction diminished. Now he wants to just be friends, but the other person is upset and calling him names.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The trans person didn't disclose their identity early on. The author feels lied to because it was withheld during the relationship. But trans people often choose when and how to share their identity. However, if they had been dating for months and the decision to be intimate was approaching, not disclosing before that could be seen as a lack of honesty. But maybe the trans person was waiting for the right time or felt safe.\n\nThe author, on the other hand, is expressing that he's straight and his attraction is based on a penis. That's a valid personal preference, even if it's not inclusive of trans people. The problem is he didn't consider that his trans friend might not be out yet. But when he found out during an intimate moment, he stopped the encounter. That's respecting the other person's boundaries if they had already shared their identity. But since the trans person didn't disclose earlier, the author might feel blindsided.\n\nThe author now wants to end the romantic relationship but stay friends. The trans person is upset and accusing him of being manipulative. The author isn't being dishonest; he's honest about his feelings. The trans person might feel betrayed because the author didn't know earlier, but the author didn't know either. The trans person's anger might be from feeling rejected after sharing personal issues, which is understandable. \n\nSo, the key points: Did the trans person have a responsibility to disclose earlier? Maybe, especially as the relationship became more intimate. But some trans people wait until they feel safe. The author's reaction is based on his sexual orientation. He's not being discriminatory, just honest about his attraction. The trans person's anger might be more about the emotional rejection than the author's actions. The author isn't in the wrong for ending the relationship because he's clear about his preferences. The trans person's actions might be more about their own hurt feelings. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
