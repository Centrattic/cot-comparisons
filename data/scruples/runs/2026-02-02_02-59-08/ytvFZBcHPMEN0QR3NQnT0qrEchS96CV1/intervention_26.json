He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong after ending a relationship because they found out their partner is trans. The scenario involves a person who developed feelings for someone they thought was male, but later discovered the person is trans (presumably a trans woman). The author's main issue is that they're straight and not attracted to vaginas, so after the revelation, their attraction faded. The trans person is upset and accuses the author of being manipulative.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The author is honest about their sexual orientation. They mention they're strictly straight and not attracted to vaginas. The trans person didn't disclose their identity earlier, which the author feels is a lie. But trans people often have the right to self-identify, and disclosure timing can be complex. The author acted on their feelings once they knew the truth, which is within their rights. However, the way the author ended things might be abrupt, especially if the relationship was intimate. The trans person's anger might stem from feeling rejected based on their gender identity, which is a sensitive issue. But the author isn't being malicious; they're being honest about their attractions. The key here is whether the author had a duty to continue the relationship despite their lack of attraction. Since the author is clear about their orientation, it's not their fault for ending the relationship. The trans person's disclosure timing is a separate issue. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
