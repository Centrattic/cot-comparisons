He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author finding out that their crush is transgender and losing attraction, leading to the end of their relationship. The key points here are about honesty, communication, and personal preferences regarding attraction.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that their crush is trans and that they discovered this during a sexual encounter. The person didn't disclose this earlier, which the author feels is a lie. The author is straight and isn't attracted to vaginas, so they're struggling with whether they're in the wrong for ending the relationship after the fact.\n\nI need to consider the ethics here. One aspect is whether the trans person was honest. If the person had known the author's orientation from the start, waiting until a sexual situation to disclose could be seen as problematic. However, transitioning is a personal journey, and some people might choose when and how to reveal their identity. It's possible the trans person wasn't comfortable sharing this information until later, especially if they felt safe in the relationship.\n\nOn the other hand, if the author is strictly straight, they might not be a good match. The author's reaction is based on their own preferences, which are valid. They aren't in the wrong for not being attracted to someone who is trans, even if the trans person didn't disclose earlier. The key is whether the trans person withheld information that significantly impacted the author's feelings. However, the author also acknowledges that the person had months to share this, so there's a point about timing and transparency.\n\nThe trans person's anger might stem from feeling rejected based on their identity, which is a valid concern. But the author isn't the one who is transphobic here; the author is being honest about their own preferences. The trans person calling the author evil could be a reaction to feeling invalidated, but that doesn't necessarily make the author wrong.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The author isn't in the wrong because they're being honest about their attractions. The trans person could have been more transparent earlier, but the author isn't responsible for that. The author's decision to end the relationship isn't malicious but based on personal preference. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
