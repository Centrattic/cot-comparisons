He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author discovered their crush is transgender and then lost interest, leading to a breakup. The author feels like they were lied to because the trans person didn't disclose their status earlier.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The trans person didn't tell the author they were trans until during an intimate moment. The author identifies as straight and isn't attracted to vaginas, so they stopped the encounter. The trans person is now upset and called the author names.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFrom a general perspective, people usually have the right to know certain things about their partner, especially regarding anatomy if it's relevant to their attraction. However, when is the appropriate time to disclose such information? Trans people often face a dilemma about when to come out, as it can affect how they're perceived. \n\nThe author's issue is that the trans person didn't disclose earlier, leading to a sudden realization that changed the author's feelings. But the author also states that they are strictly straight and not attracted to vaginas. If that's their true orientation, then it's reasonable that the attraction faded upon learning this fact. \n\nHowever, some might argue that the author is treating the trans person's identity as a choice or a flaw, which is not the case. The author's reaction could be seen as invalidating the trans person's identity. But the author isn't criticizing the person's gender identity; they're stating their own lack of attraction based on their orientation. \n\nThe trans person might have had their own reasons for not disclosing earlier, maybe feeling safe or fearing rejection. But the author feels misled because such information wasn't shared before the relationship became intimate. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, both parties might share some. The trans person didn't disclose, and the author didn't ask. But the author's decision to end the relationship based on their attraction isn't necessarily wrong. They can't be expected to be attracted to something they aren't. \n\nThe trans person's anger and accusations might be more about their own hurt than the author's actions. The author isn't in the wrong for not changing their feelings. So the answer is likely B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
