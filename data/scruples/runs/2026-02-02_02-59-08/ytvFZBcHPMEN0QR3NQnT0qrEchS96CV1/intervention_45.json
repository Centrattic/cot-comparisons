He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author finding out their crush is trans and then losing attraction. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author and their crush were friends for months, developing a relationship that led to a romantic connection. The author didn't know the person was trans until the moment they were about to have sex. The author feels lied to because the trans identity wasn't disclosed earlier.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author isn't being accused of lying or deception here. The person they were dating didn't disclose their trans status, which the author considers important. The author then expressed that their attraction faded after discovering this. The friend, on the other hand, is upset and calls the author names.\n\nFrom a rights perspective, everyone has the right to self-identify and express their gender. The trans person may have felt safe enough to come out when they did, especially if they were still in the process of transitioning or felt it wasn't necessary to mention earlier. However, the author's response is about personal attraction being tied to specific physical characteristics. \n\nThe author isn't wrong for feeling that way. Attraction is subjective and varies from person to person. The issue here is whether the trans person withheld information that the author deemed necessary. However, the trans person might not have considered it necessary to disclose immediately, or they might have been waiting for the right time. \n\nIn terms of the author's responsibility, they didn't lie or manipulate. They were honest about their feelings once they realized the attraction wasn't there. The author also wants to remain friends, which shows a desire to maintain the relationship in a non-romantic way. \n\nThe trans person being upset and accusing the author of being manipulative might be a reaction to rejection, but that doesn't necessarily make the author wrong. The author isn't in the wrong for not wanting to pursue a relationship when a key aspect (their trans identity) affects their attraction. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is B\u2014No, the author is not in the wrong. The trans person didn't lie if they were open about their identity as part of their journey, but the author's feelings are valid. The author's decision to end the relationship isn't malicious; it's based on personal preferences.\n"
