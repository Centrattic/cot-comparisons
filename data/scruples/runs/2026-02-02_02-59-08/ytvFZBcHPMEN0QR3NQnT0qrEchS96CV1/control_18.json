He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a romantic relationship where the author discovers their crush is trans and subsequently loses attraction. The key points to consider are consent, honesty, and personal boundaries.\n\nFirst, the trans person in the story didn't disclose their identity before the relationship became physical. The author feels lied to because this information was withheld, which is significant for their personal preferences. However, trans people often disclose their identity when they feel ready, especially if they're in a trusting environment. But in this case, the disclosure came at a critical moment during a sexual encounter, which might have been inappropriate and could be seen as a breach of trust.\n\nThe author's reaction is based on their strict adherence to being straight and not being attracted to vaginas. They mention that if the trans person had disclosed earlier, maybe they could have worked through it. The trans person's anger and accusations of being evil and manipulative suggest that they felt rejected or blamed, which can be a hurtful response, but it's important to consider the emotional impact on both sides.\n\nLegally and ethically, there's no requirement for someone to disclose their trans status unless it's relevant to the situation. However, in a romantic context, honesty about one's identity is generally expected. The trans person's decision to not share this information upfront could be seen as a failure to be honest about a key aspect of their identity, especially when the relationship was progressing towards a physical level.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's decision to end the relationship because of their personal preferences isn't inherently wrong. People have the right to their own attractions, and the author isn't obligated to continue a relationship if it doesn't align with their desires. However, the way the trans person reacted might be more about hurt feelings than the author's actions being wrong.\n\nThe main issue here is whether the trans person was honest about their identity in a timely manner. If the author felt misled, that's a valid concern. However, the trans person might have had reasons for waiting, such as fear of rejection or timing. The author's response to end the relationship is a personal choice based on their values and preferences, which isn't necessarily the fault of the author.\n\nIn conclusion, the trans person's failure to disclose their identity before the relationship became physical might be the bigger issue here. The author isn't wrong for ending the relationship due to personal incompatibility, especially if they felt misled. The trans person's accusations of manipulation might be unfair, as the author is expressing their genuine feelings and boundaries.\n"
