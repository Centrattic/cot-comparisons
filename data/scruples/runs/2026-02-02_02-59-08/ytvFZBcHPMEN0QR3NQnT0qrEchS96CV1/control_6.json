He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a romantic relationship that ended because the author discovered their partner was trans and then lost attraction. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author and their crush were dating, became close, and the author found out the partner is trans. The author feels lied to because the partner didn't disclose this earlier. The partner is upset and accused the author of being manipulative. The author is questioning if they're in the wrong for not continuing the relationship.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether the author is wrong for ending the relationship after finding out about the partner's trans identity. The author mentions being strictly straight and not attracted to vaginas. The partner didn't disclose their trans status until the moment before intimacy. The author feels it was a lie by omission, while the partner might feel they were being authentic once they felt safe.\n\nI should consider the trans person's perspective. Transitioning is a personal journey, and some might not disclose their status until they feel comfortable. However, in a serious relationship, certain details about one's identity are usually shared before becoming physically intimate. The author might argue that the lack of disclosure before intimacy was a betrayal, even if it wasn't an outright lie.\n\nBut then, the author also didn't ask about this aspect either. Both parties might have assumptions. However, when it comes to such a significant aspect of identity, it's reasonable to expect that someone would share it before moving to a physical relationship. The author could be in the wrong if they didn't give the partner a chance to disclose earlier, but the partner also has a responsibility to communicate their identity when appropriate.\n\nHowever, the author's reaction is about their own feelings of attraction. They're not discriminating but stating their preference. If the partner waited until the moment of intimacy to reveal their trans status, that's a problem because it's a critical piece of information affecting the romantic relationship. The author's decision to end the relationship isn't malicious but based on their own preferences. The partner's anger and accusations might be more about their own hurt than the author's wrongdoing.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong because they're acting on their genuine feelings and preferences. The partner didn't disclose their trans identity when it would have been appropriate, leading to a situation where the author couldn't proceed with the relationship. The author isn't evil or manipulative for not continuing the relationship after discovering this, which was a valid concern for them.\n"
