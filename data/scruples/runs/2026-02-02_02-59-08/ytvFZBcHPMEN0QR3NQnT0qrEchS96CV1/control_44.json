He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author discovering that their crush is trans and then losing attraction, leading to a breakup and conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author met someone at art school, became friends, and then developed romantic feelings. They started dating, and during a intimate moment, the author discovered the person is trans. The author feels lied to because the trans identity wasn't disclosed earlier. The person then became upset, called the author names, and there's tension.\n\nThe main ethical questions here are about honesty in relationships and the author's reaction. The author is questioning if they acted wrongly by not continuing the relationship after learning about the trans identity. \n\nIn many cases, people disclose their gender identity early in relationships to ensure compatibility. However, situations can vary. The author mentions being strictly straight and not attracted to vaginas. The trans person might identify as male, so the author's attraction issue is towards the biological sex rather than the gender identity. This is a personal preference, but the author is struggling with whether it's acceptable to not be attracted to someone post-disclosure.\n\nThe author isn't rejecting the person for being trans but for the physical aspect. The trans individual might have presented as male, so the author might not have known earlier. The author's frustration is about the timing of the disclosure, feeling that it was withheld during a romantic pursuit.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. The trans person might have had a valid reason to disclose later, perhaps due to their own journey or comfort level. However, in a romantic context, significant details like gender identity are typically shared before intimacy. The author's reaction is based on personal attraction, which is subjective. The trans person's anger towards the author for ending the relationship could be due to feeling rejected, but the author isn't obligated to continue a relationship where attraction is lost.\n\nThe key here is whether the author acted unkindly. The author tried to maintain friendship and didn't hide their feelings. The trans person's anger might stem from feeling invalidated, but the author isn't at fault for personal preferences. The answer would likely be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong because they had the right to their feelings and the trans person's disclosure timing might have been an issue.\n"
