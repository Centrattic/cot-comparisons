He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a romantic relationship where the person finds out their crush is trans and then loses attraction, leading to the end of the relationship.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that they became close friends with someone at art school, and the relationship progressed to a romantic level with physical intimacy. The key point is that the author discovered the person was trans during a moment of intimacy. The author feels they were lied to because the trans identity wasn't disclosed earlier and that it's important to them. They clarify they're straight and not attracted to vaginas, so this revelation changed their feelings.\n\nThe author is now friends with this person but wants to end the romantic aspect. The trans person is upset, calling the author manipulative and evil. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nLooking at the situation, the author is not in the wrong for several reasons. First, relationships involve honesty, but both parties have the right to disclose information at their own pace. The author didn't know the person was trans until that moment, which might have been the first time they felt comfortable sharing it. However, the author's issue is more about their own attractions. The author is not obligated to be attracted to someone just because they have a certain identity. Also, the trans person's reaction seems disproportionate and potentially hurtful, using labels like \"sociopath\" which might be an overreaction.\n\nThe author is honest about their feelings and preferences. They want to maintain the friendship but can't continue the romantic relationship. Ending a relationship because of lack of attraction isn't the author's fault. The trans person might have been hesitant to disclose due to fear of rejection or past experiences, but that doesn't shift responsibility to the author. The author isn't in the wrong for ending the relationship based on their own feelings and preferences. They also tried to be understanding of the other person's struggles but have the right to their own boundaries.\n\nTherefore, the author is not in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
