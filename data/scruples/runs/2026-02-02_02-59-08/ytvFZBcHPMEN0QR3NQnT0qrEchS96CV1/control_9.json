He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that they started dating someone who they later found out is trans. The author is straight and now isn't attracted anymore, so they want to end the relationship but keep the friendship. The other person is upset and called the author names. The question is whether the author is the asshole for ending the relationship because of the trans reveal.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of the relationship. The author mentions they were in a romantic relationship, making out, cuddling, etc. The key point here is that the trans person didn't disclose their gender identity until the moment when the author was about to have sex. The author feels lied to because they think the person should have told them earlier. But wait, maybe the trans person wasn't in the position to disclose earlier if the relationship was already progressing. Or maybe they were waiting for the right time.\n\nThe author admits they are strictly straight and not attracted to vaginas, which is their own preference. So, if the trans person is assigned female at birth but identifies as male and presents as male, the author might not be attracted. However, the issue here is about when and how the trans person disclosed their identity. The author felt that the disclosure came too late, during a moment of intimacy, which made them feel lied to. \n\nBut is the author in the wrong? Well, the author is honest about their own preferences. If the trans person had presented as male and the author didn't know about their trans status, then the author's attraction was to a person they believed to be cisgender. The trans person might have been waiting for a private moment to come out, which is understandable. However, if they were in a dating context where the author was seeking a relationship with a cisgender man, then the trans person's failure to disclose earlier could be an issue. But it's also possible that the trans person was trying to avoid rejection or was in the process of transitioning and wasn't ready to share yet.\n\nThe author's reaction is to end the relationship, which is a personal choice. The trans person's anger and calling the author names might be a reaction to feeling rejected. But the author isn't responsible for the trans person's feelings of rejection. The author is not in the wrong for not being attracted to someone who is trans, as attraction is personal. However, the trans person's decision to not disclose earlier could be seen as a problem, but that's on them. The author is correct in stating their own preferences and deciding the relationship isn't right for them. The trans person's anger seems misplaced, as the author isn't the one who is wrong here. The author didn't lie; they just have different preferences. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
