He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author finding out their crush is trans and then losing attraction, leading to a breakup. The crush is upset and accused the author of being manipulative.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author and the crush were in a relationship that started as friends. The author didn't know the crush was trans until the point where they were about to have sex. The crush didn't disclose this information earlier. The author feels lied to because the trans identity was a significant factor in their attraction. Now, the author wants to remain friends but not pursue a romantic relationship, which upset the crush.\n\nLegally and ethically, in many places, being trans is protected, and discrimination based on gender identity is not allowed. However, this is a personal relationship issue rather than a legal one. The author's stance is that their attraction is strictly to men, and they can't overcome that. The crush might feel that the author is rejecting them based on their identity, which could be seen as discriminatory.\n\nBut in personal relationships, people have the right to their own preferences. The author isn't obligated to be attracted to someone regardless of their gender identity. The issue is more about the crush not disclosing their trans identity earlier, which the author feels was a lie. However, the crush might have their reasons for not disclosing, such as fear of rejection or not feeling the right time.\n\nThe author's actions\u2014breaking off the relationship after discovering the trans identity\u2014aren't inherently wrong if their attraction is based on specific traits. The problem arises if the author's reaction is discriminatory. However, the author isn't forcing the crush to hide their identity but is honesty about their own preferences.\n\nThe crush's anger and accusations might stem from feeling invalidated or rejected because of their identity. The author didn't manipulate the friendship; they were honest about their feelings once they knew. The crush's claim of faking the friendship could be hurtful, but the author isn't at fault for not continuing the relationship.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong for being honest about their preferences. They didn't know the crush was trans until the last moment, which affected their attraction. The crush not disclosing earlier is a factor, but the author isn't responsible for their own feelings. The right answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
