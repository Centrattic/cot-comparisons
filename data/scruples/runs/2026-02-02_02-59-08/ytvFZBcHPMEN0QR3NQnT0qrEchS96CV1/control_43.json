He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author starts a relationship with a guy they met at art school, they become close, and things start to get sexual. During a moment of intimacy, the author discovers that the guy is transgender, specifically that he doesn't have a penis. The author feels like they were lied to because the guy didn't disclose his trans status earlier. The author is straight and not attracted to vaginas, so their attraction diminishes. The guy gets angry and calls the author evil and manipulative. The author is questioning if they're in the wrong for ending the relationship.\n\nNow, the key points here. The guy didn't disclose his trans identity. But when did he have to disclose it? The author met him at art school, and they became friends first, then the relationship developed over months. The guy is trans, which might mean he's a trans man (assigned female at birth) undergoing transition. However, the author is straight, so they're into men. If the guy is a trans man, he might present as male and identify as male, so the author might not have known his gender history. \n\nBut the author is saying they were lied to. However, if the guy is a trans man, he might not have felt comfortable disclosing that unless asked. Maybe he presented as male, and the author didn't question it. So, was the guy hiding his trans status? Or was he just not out yet? Also, the author's reaction is that they feel lied to because the guy didn't mention it during their relationship. But the author is strict about being attracted only to penises. If the guy is a trans man with a vagina, then the author's attraction is based on a biological factor. \n\nIn terms of ethics, is the author in the wrong for ending the relationship because they're not attracted to the person? The author is honest about their preferences. The guy didn't disclose, but maybe expected the author to figure it out. However, the author might not have been aware of his trans status. The guy might have gone through transition and is now living as a man, so the author's reaction could be seen as not considering the guy's identity. \n\nBut the author's issue is about attraction and the fact that the guy didn't mention his trans status. The author feels lied to, but if the guy is living as a man and is a friend who they became close to, maybe the author didn't have a reason to know. The guy might have felt that his trans status wasn't something he wanted to disclose early in the relationship. \n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong for ending the relationship. The author is not in the wrong if they are honest about their preferences. However, if the guy is a trans man and living as a man, then he's a man in terms of gender identity. But the author is attracted to men, so maybe there's confusion here. Wait, if the guy is a trans man, then he is a man, and the author is into men. So the author's lack of attraction might not be about gender but about physical attributes. But the author is stating that they are not attracted to vaginas. So perhaps the author is into penises specifically, regardless of gender. \n\nIn that case, the author's attraction is based on a specific anatomy. The guy might be a trans man who hasn't had surgery, hence the author found out during intimacy. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong for not being attracted to someone who, while identifying as male, doesn't have the anatomy the author is into. The author is being honest about their preferences. The guy's anger at the author for ending the relationship might be misplaced, as the author is not being judgmental about the guy's identity but about their own lack of attraction. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. The guy didn't disclose, but maybe the author couldn't have known. The author is right to be honest about their feelings. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
