He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" question is in the wrong. The situation is that the author (let's call them Person A) had a crush on someone they met at art school. They became friends, started dating, and things were going well. Then, during a moment where they were about to have sex, Person A noticed the other person (Person B) doesn't have a penis. It turns out Person B is transgender. Person A felt lied to because Person B didn't disclose this earlier. They're now not attracted to Person B anymore and want to stay friends but not be in a relationship. Person B is upset and accused Person A of being evil. The question is whether Person A is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The main issue is whether Person B was truthful about their identity. Transgender people often face the dilemma of when to disclose their status. Some choose to do so early, others later, depending on the context and comfort level. However, consent and honesty are important in relationships. If Person B didn't disclose being transgender, especially if they were presenting in a way that suggested a male identity, that could be seen as deceptive. But the situation is nuanced because being transgender is a part of one's identity, and the decision to share it is personal.\n\nPerson A is straight and not attracted to vaginas. That's their orientation, and it's valid. The problem arises because they felt the information was withheld at a critical moment\u2014just before intimacy. The sudden revelation might have made it harder for Person A to adjust their feelings, whereas earlier disclosure might have allowed for a different outcome. However, the timing of disclosure is a common issue in many relationships, not just in cases involving transgender individuals.\n\nNow, considering that transgender people may have reasons for not disclosing earlier, such as fear of rejection or not knowing when to bring it up, but in a romantic context, there's an expectation of honesty. If Person B was presenting as male and didn't correct that before intimacy, that could be a breach of trust.\n\nPerson A's reaction is understandable given their orientation. They're not in the wrong for feeling that way. But maybe they handled it poorly by not wanting to continue the relationship after the fact. However, it's their right to choose their attractions. The accusations from Person B about being manipulative are likely defensive and hurtful, possibly due to the emotional impact of the situation.\n\nIn terms of ethics, Person A isn't in the wrong for not wanting to be in a relationship with someone they're not attracted to. They also aren't responsible for Person B's feelings of betrayal. However, Person B might have a case in terms of disclosure before intimacy, depending on how the relationship developed. But since Person B is transgender, it's possible they didn't realize they needed to disclose earlier, or felt it was too soon. The key point is that Person A's orientation is valid, and their decision to end the relationship isn't malicious.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer would be that Person A isn't in the wrong. They're not the asshole here. They had a change in attraction due to information they received, which is a personal reaction. They tried to maintain the friendship, which shows they care. The transgression, if any, might be on Person B for not disclosing sooner, but the question is about Person A's wrongness, which isn't present here.\n"
