He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author discovered their crush is trans and then lost attraction, which led to the relationship ending. The author is wondering if they're being an asshole for not continuing the relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author says they found out their crush was trans when they were about to have sex. The trans person didn't disclose this earlier, and the author now feels they weren't attracted to a vagina. The author also mentions that the trans person is upset and called them names. The author is struggling with whether they're in the wrong for ending the relationship.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is wrong for not continuing the relationship after learning the person is trans. Let's break down the arguments. \n\nOn one hand, the author is being honest about their feelings. They clarified that they're straight and not attracted to vaginas. It's reasonable for someone to know their own preferences. The trans person didn't disclose their identity early on, which the author feels was a lie. But maybe the trans person had their reasons for not disclosing earlier, like fear of rejection or personal comfort.\n\nOn the other hand, the author made a choice to end the relationship after the fact. But the author didn't reject the person outright; they mentioned they still want to be friends. However, the trans person is upset, calling the author names. The author might feel they're not in the wrong because they're being honest about their feelings. \n\nI should think about consent and communication. The trans person might have the right to their own journey in disclosing their identity. The author's reaction is based on their attraction being to a penis, which is their personal preference. But is it the author's fault for not being attracted to someone who is trans? \n\nAlso, the author didn't push for disclosure earlier. They had months of friendship and dating without the trans person mentioning it. The author might feel misled because they expected more transparency, but the trans person might have felt it was their choice when to share. \n\nIn terms of being an asshole, the author is honest about their feelings and wants to remain friends. The trans person's anger might stem from feeling rejected or that the author didn't support them, but the author isn't being malicious. \n\nSo, considering all this, the answer is probably B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They're being honest about their preferences and aren't being offensive. The trans person's disclosure timing and the author's reaction are complex, but the author isn't wrong for not pursuing the relationship.\n"
