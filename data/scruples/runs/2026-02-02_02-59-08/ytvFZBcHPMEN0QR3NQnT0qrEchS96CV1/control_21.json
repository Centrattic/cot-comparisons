He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author met someone they liked, became close friends, and things escalated into a romantic relationship. They didn't realize the person was transgender until the moment when things were about to become sexual. The key point here is that the trans person kept their identity secret until that point. The author feels like they were lied to because they were under the impression the person was cisgender. \n\nThe author is straight and isn't attracted to vaginas, so after finding out, their attraction faded. They want to stay friends but the other person is upset and even called them names. The author is wondering if they're in the wrong for not continuing the relationship.\n\nNow, considering gender identity and authenticity. The trans person might have been waiting for the right time to come out, but in a romantic context, especially before becoming physically intimate, transparency is crucial. If the trans person didn't disclose early on, that could lead to the author feeling misled, especially since they mentioned the person had months to tell them.\n\nAlso, the author isn't being derogatory; they're explaining their sexual orientation. It's their preference, and it's not uncommon for people to have specific attractions. The problem here is the timing of the disclosure. The trans person's decision to not come out until that moment led to a situation where the author felt they were lied to. \n\nBut wait, maybe the trans person had their reasons for not disclosing earlier. They might have been scared or unsure. However, in a relationship that's heading towards physical intimacy, withholding such a significant detail could be seen as a breach of trust. The author's reaction is about their personal boundaries and not wanting to deceive themselves or the other person.\n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't know. They were honest about their feelings once they found out. They still want to maintain a friendship, which shows they're not malicious. The other person's anger and accusations seem extreme, possibly because they were hoping for a romantic relationship and were rejected. \n\nLegally and ethically, the author isn't in the wrong. They had no prior knowledge and acted based on the information they had. Their decision to stop the relationship due to personal attraction isn't malicious. The trans person has the right to be their authentic self, but in this case, the timing of disclosure affected the relationship's direction. \n\nSo, the answer would be B. The author is not in the wrong. They're navigating a situation where their preferences don't align with the trans person's identity, and they're honest about their feelings. The responsibility lies with the trans person for not disclosing earlier.\n"
