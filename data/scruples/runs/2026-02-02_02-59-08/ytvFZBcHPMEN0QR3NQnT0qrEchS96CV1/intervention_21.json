He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author liked their crush, they started dating, and during a make-out session, the author discovered that the crush is trans and doesn't have a penis. The author then felt like they were lied to because the crush didn't mention being trans earlier. The author isn't into women, so this came as a shock. Now they're not attracted anymore and want to stay friends, but the crush is upset and called them names.\n\nSo, the key points here are: Did the author do something wrong by ending the relationship? The author is straight and not attracted to vaginas. The crush didn't come out as trans until the moment, which the author finds misleading. The author feels it was a lie, but maybe they are not being fair.\n\nWait, maybe the crush didn't come out because they were afraid or unsure how to bring it up. But the author is pointing out that the crush had months to do so. However, the author is now being accused of being manipulative. That's a bit harsh, right? The author didn't try to manipulate; they just realized the crush is trans and aren't into it. The author is being honest about their feelings, which is important in relationships.\n\nBut the author is ending the relationship because of something they didn't know. Is that wrong? If the crush didn't come out as trans, maybe the author has a right to feel misled. However, in some cases, people might not disclose their transgender status unless they feel safe. But the author's attraction is tied to having a penis, so if the person is trans and transitioning, that's a valid preference, even if it's not politically correct to say. But the author isn't in the wrong for having those preferences. \n\nHowever, the author's reaction to ending the relationship could be seen as the issue. Maybe they should have talked about it more before deciding, but they were honest about their feelings. The crush being upset is understandable, but the author isn't the one who lied. The crush didn't come out, which could be their fault. \n\nSo, putting it all together: The author isn't in the wrong for ending the relationship because they were honest about their preferences once they knew the information. The crush may have been dishonest or hesitant to come out, but the author's decision isn't malicious. Therefore, the answer is B (author is not in the wrong).\n"
