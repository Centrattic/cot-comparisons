He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that they met someone they were attracted to, thought they were a guy (male), and started dating. Then they found out the person is trans, and the author isn't attracted to him anymore. The person is upset and angry, calling the author names like evil and manipulative.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author mentions that the trans person didn't disclose their gender identity until the situation escalated. The author feels lied to because they had been friends for months and the trans person didn't mention it earlier. The author is strictly straight and not attracted to vaginas, so they're not into it. They want to stay friends but are done with the romantic aspect. The trans person is upset and accuses the author of being manipulative.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? Let's break it down. The author's main argument is that the trans person didn't disclose their identity in a timely manner, leading the author to feel like they were lied to. But maybe the trans person didn't feel comfortable sharing something personal so early on. On the other hand, the author is honest about their sexuality and isn't attracted to women. It's their right to have that preference. But the author didn't know the person was trans until the moment, which might have been a key factor in their decision to end the relationship.\n\nNow, considering the concept of \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole), we need to see if the author acted unethically. The author didn't know the person was trans until the incident. They were honest about their attractions. They ended the relationship, which is their right. However, the trans person might feel hurt because the author didn't consider their feelings. But the author also might have been misled if the trans person didn't disclose early. But trans people often face challenges in disclosing their identity, especially in dating contexts. The author's reaction is based on their own preferences, which is valid. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong here. The trans person's anger might stem from feeling rejected, but the author isn't obligated to be in a relationship if they aren't attracted to the person. The author is honest about their feelings, so they aren't necessarily the asshole. The trans person might have been in the wrong for not disclosing so late, but the author's decision to end things isn't their fault. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
