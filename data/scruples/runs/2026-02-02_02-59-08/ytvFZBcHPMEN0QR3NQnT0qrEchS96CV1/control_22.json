He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong.\n\nThe situation is that the author had a crush on someone, thought they were a guy, and they started dating. But when they were about to have sex, the guy revealed he's trans and has a vagina. The author wasn't attracted anymore and wants to just be friends. The guy is upset and called the author evil and manipulative. The author is confused if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The guy didn't disclose his trans status early on. The author wasn't attracted to someone with a vagina, which is a personal preference. The guy might have waited until the last minute to tell, which feels like a lie. But on the other hand, transitioning is a big personal journey, and maybe he felt ready to share only later. \n\nThe author stopped the intimate act when they found out. They tried to be understanding about his struggles but still felt lied to. The guy's reaction is extreme, accusing the author of being manipulative, which seems unfair. The author isn't in the wrong for not being attracted to someone once they find out they're trans, especially if they had a strict preference. \n\nBut does the author have a responsibility to accept someone regardless of their preferences? The question is about being in the wrong. The author didn't force anything, stopped the act, and wants to remain friends. The guy's anger might stem from rejection, but that doesn't mean the author is wrong. \n\nSo the answer would be B (Not in the wrong). The author's attraction is subjective, and the guy didn't share his trans status early enough. The author isn't obligated to be in a relationship if their preferences don't align.\n"
