He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation is that the author was in a romantic relationship with a guy who is trans. The author found out that the guy is trans when they were about to have sex, and now the guy is upset because the author isn't attracted to him anymore. The author is questioning if they're in the wrong for not continuing the relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The guy didn't disclose his trans identity until the moment of intimacy, which the author feels was a lie. The author is straight and isn't attracted to vaginas, so they feel tricked. The guy is now upset and calling the author names. \n\nSo, the main issues here are honesty in relationships and mutual attraction. In most relationships, both parties should be honest about their identities and expectations. If the guy didn't disclose his trans status early on, that could be a problem. The author might not be in the wrong if the guy didn't provide enough information. However, the author is also choosing to end the relationship because of a lack of attraction, which is a personal preference. \n\nBut the author is being asked if they're an asshole for ending the relationship because the guy is trans. The author isn't being malicious, just stating their preference. However, the way they framed it could be seen as hurtful. The guy might feel that the author is using his trans identity as a reason to end the relationship, which could be transphobic. \n\nOn the other hand, the author did like him as a person and wanted to continue being friends. The guy's reaction seems extreme, but that's his responsibility. The author isn't in the wrong for choosing to end the relationship due to lack of attraction, especially if the guy didn't disclose his identity earlier. However, the author could have handled it more sensitively. \n\nBut according to AITA standards, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the author was honest about their preferences and the guy didn't disclose his trans identity early enough, the author isn't at fault. However, if the author's reaction was transphobic, that would be different. The author here states they are straight and not attracted to vaginas, which is a personal preference, not a judgment. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author is not in the wrong. The guy didn't disclose his identity, and the author is honest about their preferences. The guy's anger might stem from feeling rejected, but the author isn't being malicious. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
