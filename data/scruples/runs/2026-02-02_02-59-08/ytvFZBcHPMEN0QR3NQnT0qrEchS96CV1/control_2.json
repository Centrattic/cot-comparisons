He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a romantic relationship where the author discovered their crush is trans and subsequently lost attraction. The key points here are about honesty in relationships and personal boundaries.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that their crush didn't disclose being trans until the moment when they were about to have sex. The author feels lied to because the information wasn't shared earlier. The trans person had known this about themselves for months but didn't bring it up until that critical moment. The author is straight and not attracted to vaginas, which complicates things further.\n\nThe author is now facing backlash from the trans person, who accuses them of being evil and manipulative. The author is confused because they want to maintain a friendship but aren't interested in continuing the relationship. The main question is whether the author is in the wrong for not continuing the relationship after the revelation.\n\nFrom a standpoint of honesty in relationships, it's generally expected that partners be upfront about significant aspects of their identity, especially when it pertains to their gender or sexual identity, which can impact the relationship's direction. The trans person might have felt they needed to be in a more committed relationship before disclosing, but withholding such information until the point of intimacy could be seen as a failure to communicate honestly.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is expressing their genuine feelings and boundaries. They clarify that they are strictly straight and that their attraction has diminished after the revelation. The author isn't rejecting the person as a person but is stating their physical attraction is based on having a penis. That's their personal truth, and it's their right to set boundaries based on their preferences.\n\nThe trans person's reaction\u2014calling the author evil and manipulative\u2014seems disproportionate and potentially invalidates the author's right to their feelings. The author is not choosing to be in a relationship with someone they aren't attracted to, which is a valid decision. The key here is whether the trans person withheld information that was crucial for the author's consent to the relationship. If the trans person didn't disclose this information until the point of intimacy, it could be seen as a breach of trust.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, being trans is part of someone's identity, and in many cultures, it's considered important to disclose such information earlier in a relationship, especially if it affects the other person's comfort or consent. The author is not the one who withheld information; they are reacting to a situation where their own comfort and boundaries were not respected by the other party.\n\nTherefore, the author is not in the wrong. They are expressing their feelings honestly and setting boundaries based on their attraction, which is a legitimate reason to not continue the relationship. The trans person's anger and accusations seem to stem from a place of feeling rejected, but that doesn't make the author's actions wrong. The author isn't being manipulative; they're being truthful about their preferences.\n"
