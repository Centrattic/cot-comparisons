He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by breaking down the situation. They met a guy at art school, became friends, and then developed romantic feelings. They started dating, doing things like making out and cuddling. The author is strictly straight and not attracted to vaginas. The problem is that the guy is trans, and when they got to a point where they were about to have sex, the author noticed he didn't have a penis. The guy then revealed he's trans. The author feels lied to because the guy didn't tell them sooner, and now the author isn't attracted to him anymore. They want to stay friends but the guy is upset, calling them evil and manipulative. The author is confused if they're the asshole for ending the relationship.\n\nFirst, I should consider the definition of lying. If the guy didn't disclose his trans identity before the romantic relationship escalated, is that a lie? Well, maybe he wasn't out to the author yet. If he intended to be honest but hadn't gotten around to it, does that count as lying? Or is it just a lack of disclosure? The author might feel that the guy was being deceptive by not telling them earlier, but if the guy's intention was to tell eventually, maybe it's not a lie. However, if the guy knew that the author's attraction depends on the person being male (which the author says they're strictly straight), then not disclosing before things got intimate could be seen as a misrepresentation. \n\nBut wait, being trans is about gender identity, not necessarily about being male or female. The guy might identify as male, even if he has a vagina. So maybe the author is conflating gender with anatomy. The key question is whether the guy misrepresented his gender to the author. If he correctly presented his gender as male, then the author's attraction is based on his gender, not his anatomy. In that case, the author isn't wrong because they're acting on their own preferences. However, if the guy was hiding his trans status and leading the author to believe he was cisgender, then he might be the one in the wrong for not being honest. \n\nThe author's feelings here are important. They feel lied to because they believe the guy didn't share a crucial detail in time. The author's orientation is a factor\u2014being strictly straight means they aren't interested in people of the other gender. But if the trans guy is presenting as male, the author's attraction would be to a male, so the author isn't wrong for not being interested in the other anatomy. \n\nOn the other hand, the guy might have his own reasons for not coming out earlier\u2014maybe he wasn't out yet or didn't want to scare the author off. But the author's issue is that the physical aspect is important for their attraction. So the author is making a decision based on their own sexual preferences, which is valid. The guy's anger might stem from feeling rejected or from the pain of not being accepted, but the author's response is to end the romantic relationship, which they have the right to do if they're not attracted to him. \n\nIs the author in the wrong for not continuing the relationship? Probably not. They're being honest about their preferences. The guy may have had the opportunity to disclose his identity earlier, but the author is not obligated to maintain a romantic relationship if it's based on their own attraction. The real issue is the guy's reaction\u2014he's calling the author names, which is not okay, but the author's choice to end the romantic part isn't the problem. \n\nSo the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong. They're acting on their own feelings and preferences, and the trans guy may have had his own issues, but the author's decision is justified.\n"
