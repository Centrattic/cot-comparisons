He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that they had a crush on someone they later found out is trans. The author realized they weren't attracted to him after finding out, and the trans person is upset.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that they were in a dating-like relationship with this guy, getting to the point of making out and almost having sex. The trans person didn't disclose their trans status until that intimate moment. The author feels lied to because they didn't know earlier, and now they're not interested anymore. The trans person is upset and called the author names.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, the key points here are about honesty and communication in relationships. It's important for both parties to know each other's important details. The trans person didn't disclose something significant that affects the author's attraction. That could be seen as a lack of honesty. However, the author is also not in the wrong for not being attracted to someone if their anatomy is different from what they're into. People have different preferences, and it's okay to realize that you're not interested in someone once you learn something important about them.\n\nThe author isn't rejecting the person for not being trans, but for the fact that their anatomy doesn't align with their attraction. The trans person might have been waiting for the right time to come out, but it's understandable that the author would feel misled if that information wasn't shared before things got intimate. The author is trying to be respectful, acknowledging the trans person's struggles but also being honest about their own feelings.\n\nOn the flip side, the trans person's reaction of calling the author names and accusing them of faking the friendship is inappropriate. That behavior is harmful and doesn't help resolve the situation. The author is trying to maintain friendship, which is considerate. So, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They have a right to their feelings and to know important information about their partner. The trans person's actions were flawed in not being honest, but the author isn't at fault for ending the relationship based on their attraction.\n"
