He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author finding out their crush is trans and then losing attraction, leading to the end of the relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the details. The author and their crush were friends for months, developing a romantic relationship. They were engaging in intimate activities, almost having sex when the author discovered the person was trans. The author feels lied to because the trans person didn't disclose this information earlier. The author is straight and not attracted to vaginas, so their attraction decreased after finding out. The trans person is upset and accused the author of being manipulative, which the author now sees as a sociopath.\n\nSo, the core issue is whether the author is wrong for ending the relationship after discovering the trans identity. The author didn't know the person was trans initially, and the trans person didn't come out earlier. The author is strict about being straight and can't overcome that aspect. \n\nI should consider the ethics here. If someone is in a relationship and discovers something about their partner that they find incompatible, is that their right? The author didn't know the person was trans from the start. The trans person might have felt comfortable coming out later, but the author feels they were misled because it wasn't disclosed upfront. \n\nHowever, the trans person's right to self-identify and come out on their own terms is important. They might have been scared or not ready to share that part of their identity earlier. The author's reaction is about personal attraction, which is a valid feeling. It's not about being offensive necessarily, but about personal preference. \n\nBut the author is being accused of being manipulative, which seems harsh. The author is ending the relationship because of their sexual orientation, which they can't control. The trans person's anger might stem from feeling rejected, but the author isn't at fault for not being attracted to someone with a different gender identity. \n\nAlso, the author wants to maintain a friendship but can't continue the relationship. That's reasonable. People have the right to reassess their feelings when new information comes to light, even if it's unintentionally kept from them. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. They acted based on their attraction and sexual orientation. The trans person not disclosing earlier doesn't make the author wrong for feeling that way. The author isn't being malicious, just honest about their preferences. The answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
