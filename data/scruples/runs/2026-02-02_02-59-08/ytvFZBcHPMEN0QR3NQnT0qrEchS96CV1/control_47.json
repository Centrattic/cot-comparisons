He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the author of that \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author had a crush on someone they later found out was trans and then lost attraction. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the author met someone at art school, became friends, and things turned romantic. They were dating, making out, cuddling, etc. Then during a sexual encounter, the author discovered the person was trans (no penis). The author then stopped the interaction and mentioned feeling lied to because the trans person didn't disclose their identity earlier. The author is straight and not attracted to vaginas, so their attraction faded. Now the trans person is upset and called the author names, leading the author to question if they're the asshole.\n\nHmm. So, the key points here are about honesty, identity disclosure, and attraction. The trans person didn't reveal they were trans before the relationship became physical. The author feels they were lied to, but maybe the trans person didn't lie; they just didn't disclose. It's a tricky situation because people don't always disclose their gender identity upfront for various reasons. \n\nThe author is strict about being straight and not attracted to vaginas. The trans person might be assigned male at birth but identifies as female. The author didn't realize this until the moment, which led to a loss of attraction. Now, the trans person is upset, thinking the author is being cruel.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the author didn't know the person's gender identity. They developed feelings and then later found out. The author's attraction is based on their understanding of the person's gender. If the trans person didn't disclose early enough, maybe they should have if the author needed that information. But on the other hand, it's the author's responsibility to know their own preferences. The author might have assumed the person was cisgender. \n\nThe trans person might feel that the author is rejecting them because of their identity, but the author is saying it's about attraction. The author is not being malicious, just being honest about their feelings. The trans person's anger might be about feeling rejected or not accepted, but the author isn't the one who is in the wrong for being honest about their preferences. \n\nIn terms of ethics, the author isn't lying. They are expressing their lack of attraction based on the new information. The trans person might have been evasive about their identity, but the author isn't obligated to accept a relationship if it doesn't align with their preferences. The author is also trying to maintain a friendship. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No). The author isn't in the wrong for being honest about their attraction. They can't be held responsible for the trans person's decision to not disclose their identity earlier. The author has the right to their preferences, and it's not their fault they weren't informed sooner.\n"
