He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong after finding out their crush is trans and losing attraction. The author is a straight person who didn't realize the person was trans until they were about to have sex. They feel lied to because the trans person didn't come out earlier. The author now wants to stay friends but not pursue a relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation from both sides. The author is honest about being straight and not attracted to vaginas. They feel that the trans person was deceptive because they didn't disclose their trans status. But trans people often choose when and how to share their gender identity. It's a personal decision, and some might share it early, while others might wait until they feel comfortable. \n\nThe trans person might have been waiting for a closer relationship before coming out. The author didn't ask about their identity, so it's not necessarily a lie. The author is now questioning if it's their fault for not asking or if the trans person was deceptive. \n\nAlso, the author is not in the wrong for feeling that way. Being honest about one's attractions is important. But the author is being harsh, calling the trans person a sociopath, which isn't fair. However, the author's actions\u2014stopping the relationship and not wanting to date\u2014are valid because they are clear about their preferences. \n\nThe trans person's anger and calling the author evil seems unjustified. The author didn't force a relationship; they were honest about their feelings. The trans person might have hoped for a romantic outcome that wasn't possible for the author. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for not wanting to be in a relationship with someone they're not attracted to. The key point is that the trans person didn't lie in a way that was deceptive; they may have shared their identity at a time they felt comfortable. The author's reaction is based on personal preferences, which is okay. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
