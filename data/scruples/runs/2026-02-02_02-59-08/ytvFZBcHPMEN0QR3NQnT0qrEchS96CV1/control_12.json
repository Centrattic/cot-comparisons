He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong based on the situation they described. Let me start by breaking down the key points.\n\nThe author met a guy at art school, became friends, and then both developed romantic feelings. They started dating, had hot and heavy make-out sessions, and were about to have sex when the author noticed the guy didn't have a penis. At that point, the author found out he was trans. The author is now not attracted to him anymore, wants to stay friends but not in a romantic way. The guy is mad and called the author evil and manipulative, even saying he faked their friendship. The author is confused about whether they did the wrong thing.\n\nFirst, I should consider the dynamics of the relationship. The author mentions they were building a friendship over months and then developed a romantic connection. The issue is that the guy didn't disclose his trans status early on. The author feels like the guy didn't tell them something important in time, leading to a loss of attraction. The author is straight and not attracted to vaginas, so when the physical aspect didn't align, the attraction faded. \n\nI need to think about whether the guy was deceptive. The author says he gave a \"oh yeah...\" response when they discovered his genitals. If the guy didn't have a penis, that might be a part of his trans identity, perhaps as a trans man who hasn't undergone surgery or a trans woman. But the question is about when he should have disclosed this. If the guy had transitioned publicly, he might have mentioned it earlier. The author is upset that he waited until that intimate moment to reveal it. \n\nNow, considering the author's actions: they were in a romantic relationship, had physical intimacy, and upon realizing the gender aspect, decided they weren't attracted. The author wants to remain friends but stop the romantic part. The guy is angry and seems to be lashing out, maybe feeling betrayed. The author is being called a bad person for ending the relationship. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, if the guy didn't disclose his trans status, maybe the author isn't wrong for being attracted to someone who's not their preferred gender. The author's attraction is a personal preference, and they have the right to know if that's a dealbreaker. However, the guy's actions might be in question here. If he didn't mention it during the time when they were building the relationship, especially as it's a significant aspect for intimacy, then he might be at fault for not being upfront. \n\nBut the author could argue that they were in a relationship where certain expectations about gender identity weren't met. The author's feelings of being lied to might be valid if the guy wasn't open about his trans identity, especially if it's relevant to the relationship's progression. The author's reaction seems to be about their own preferences and the timing of the disclosure. \n\nAlso, the guy's response is pretty extreme. Calling the author evil and manipulative, and suggesting he faked the friendship, might indicate he's projecting his own actions onto the author. The author didn't mislead the guy; they were honest about their feelings once they realized the issue. \n\nI should check if there's a cultural or social aspect I'm missing. Trans people often disclose their status when they feel comfortable, depending on their personal journey. If the guy transitioned and is presenting as male, he might be in the process of transitioning and hasn't undergone certain procedures. However, if the author is strictly into men and the guy is a trans man who hasn't had surgery, technically he is a man, so the author's reaction might be based on misconceptions. Wait, the author mentions they were about to have sex and noticed there's no penis. If the guy is a trans man who hasn't had surgery, he might have a vagina. So the author is not attracted to that. \n\nBut does the author have a right to end the relationship based on that? The author's sexual orientation is a personal thing. If being strictly into men includes trans men, then the author is in the wrong for not continuing the relationship. However, if the author is into cisgender men specifically, then the guy being trans might be a conflict. But the author's understanding of their own orientation is crucial here. \n\nThe problem is the guy didn't disclose his trans status. If it's a significant factor for the author, then the guy should have been honest earlier. But if the author is not in the wrong because they were honest about their feelings once they realized the issue, then they aren't at fault. The guy's anger seems unfounded if he didn't mention it before the physical intimacy. \n\nSo, the author is not in the wrong (B) because they ended the relationship based on their own preferences after discovering information that matters to them. The guy's actions of not disclosing earlier and then being upset about the author's decision are more to blame. The author isn't being manipulative; they're acting on their genuine feelings.\n"
