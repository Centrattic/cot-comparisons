He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a crush being trans and the author losing attraction after finding out.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author and their crush were friends for months, developed a romantic relationship, and were about to have sex when the author discovered the person is trans. The author feels lied to because they weren't told earlier. They're straight and not attracted to vaginas, so they can't continue the relationship. The trans person is upset and accused the author of being evil. The question is whether the author is at fault.\n\nHmm. So, the author didn't know their partner was trans. The trans person didn't disclose this fact until just before a sexual encounter. The author feels it's important information that wasn't shared early enough for them to adjust their feelings. The trans person might have felt they were in a relationship already and didn't want to risk rejection, but withholding such a significant detail can be problematic.\n\nFrom a relationship perspective, honesty is usually key. If someone is trans, it's important to share that information when the relationship becomes serious enough. However, timing can be tricky. The author might argue that it's not their fault for feeling that way once they found out. Being straight isn't a choice and they're not attracted to vaginas. So, the author isn't wrong for not being attracted to someone after finding out they're trans. The trans person could have been more honest earlier to avoid this situation.\n\nBut the trans person might have felt vulnerable or scared to come out. However, withholding such a significant detail when the relationship is progressing to a sexual level could be seen as a breach of trust, even if unintentional. The author isn't in the wrong for not wanting to continue the relationship. They can't help their sexuality. The trans person's anger might stem from hurt feelings, but the author isn't being manipulative. They're honest about their feelings now. So, the answer is probably B, No, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
