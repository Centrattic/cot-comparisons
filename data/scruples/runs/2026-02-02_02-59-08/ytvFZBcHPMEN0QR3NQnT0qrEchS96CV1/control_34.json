He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author had a crush on someone they met at art school. They became friends and eventually started dating. The author didn't know that their crush was trans. When they were about to have sex, the author discovered that their crush doesn't have a penis and that they're trans. The author then stopped the interaction and said their attraction faded. The crush got upset, called the author names, and now the author is wondering if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The key points here are about being trans and the author's reaction. The author mentions they're strictly straight and not attracted to vaginas. The trans person didn't disclose their identity until the situation escalated, and the author felt lied to. \n\nNow, in terms of being in the wrong, does the author have a valid reason to feel the way they do? Well, attraction is subjective. If someone identifies as a certain gender and presents as such, others might not realize they're trans until later. The author wasn't aware, so the trans person might have been presenting as male, leading to the author's attraction based on that. \n\nBut then, the author is accused of being in the wrong because the trans person felt they didn't disclose early enough. However, the author didn't know. The trans person might have chosen when to disclose their identity. The author's reaction is about their own feelings of attraction and being straight, which isn't inherently wrong. It's their personal preference, even if it's not the same as others.\n\nThe accusation of the author being manipulative or evil seems harsh. The author didn't intentionally lead the trans person on. They were in a relationship that they thought was mutual, but upon discovering something they consider important, they decided they weren't interested anymore. That's their right. People can change their feelings based on new information, even if it's unintentional.\n\nOn the other hand, the trans person might have felt they were being honest, but if they were presenting as male, the author couldn't have known otherwise. There's a debate here about when to disclose trans status. Some people prefer to be out from the start, others later. The author's reaction isn't malicious, just based on their attraction.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They made a decision based on new information that affects their personal preferences. They didn't hide their orientation beforehand. The trans person might have a right to feel hurt, but the author's choice isn't unethical or malicious.\n"
