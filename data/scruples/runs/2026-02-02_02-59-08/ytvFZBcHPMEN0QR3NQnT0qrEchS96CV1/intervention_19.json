He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for no longer being attracted to their crush after finding out they're trans. The situation involves a romantic relationship that started from a friendship.\n\nFirst, the key points: The author discovered their crush is trans and felt lied to because the information wasn't disclosed earlier. They consider themselves straight and aren't attracted to vaginas. The crush became upset, calling the author evil, but the author is now considering them a sociopath.\n\nThe main issue is whether the author is wrong for ending the relationship. The author's reasoning is that the crush didn't disclose their trans identity early enough, leading to a sudden revelation during an intimate moment. The author feels the truth should have been shared before the relationship became serious. \n\nOn the other hand, the crush might argue that their identity as trans is a core part of who they are, and the author might have been expected to get to know them as a person first. However, the author clearly states they are straight and only attracted to men. The timing of the disclosure is a critical factor here. The crush waited until the relationship was physical before revealing their trans status, which the author found misleading.\n\nIn terms of ethics, honesty is important in relationships, especially regarding one's identity. However, if the crush had come out as trans earlier in the friendship, the author might have had time to adjust their feelings. The crush's reaction of anger and calling the author names is concerning, but the author's decision to end the relationship is based on their personal feelings and orientation. \n\nThe user's own opinion is that the author is in the wrong, but the key question is whether the author's action is justified. Since the author is not in the wrong for being straight and not attracted to a vagina, even if the crush's disclosure was delayed, the author's attraction is a personal preference. The crush's anger seems misplaced, but the author isn't at fault for their lack of attraction. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
