He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author started dating someone who is trans, found out he's trans during a sexual encounter, and then lost interest because he's straight. Now the trans person is upset and accusing the author of being evil and manipulative.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the timeline. The author mentions they were friends for months before developing a romantic relationship. The trans person didn't disclose their gender identity until the sexual encounter. The author feels lied to because they think it was important information that was withheld. The trans person is now angry and calling the author names, but the author is confused about whether they did something wrong.\n\nI should think about consent and honesty in relationships. Generally, people should disclose information that affects their partner's comfort or boundaries. However, the trans person might not have felt safe to disclose earlier, or maybe they thought they had already established a relationship where the author would accept them. But the author is straight and not attracted to people with vaginas, so the trans person's identity is a deal-breaker for them.\n\nIs the author in the wrong for ending the relationship? If the trans person didn't disclose their gender identity early enough, maybe the author isn't at fault. But maybe the trans person should have been more upfront from the start. However, coming out can be a personal and scary process. The author is being honest about their preferences, which could be seen as not being offensive. The trans person's anger might stem from feeling rejected or hurt, but calling the author names is not helpful.\n\nAlso, the author wants to continue the friendship, which shows they don't want to be malicious. The key here is whether the trans person had the opportunity to disclose their identity. If they had months to tell and didn't, the author isn't necessarily wrong for feeling misled. But maybe the trans person wasn't ready or felt unsafe. However, in a romantic relationship, certain information is usually expected earlier, especially regarding physical aspects. \n\nIn terms of societal views, some might argue that the author is being insensitive, but the author is clear they're not trying to be offensive. The trans person's reaction seems extreme. The author's decision to end the relationship is based on personal preferences, which is a valid reason. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
