He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for losing attraction after finding out their crush is trans. \n\nFirst, the author mentions they developed a romantic relationship and were about to have sex when they discovered the person is trans. They feel lied to because the person didn't disclose this earlier. The author is straight and not attracted to vaginas, so they lost interest. Now, the trans person is upset and called the author names. The author is questioning if they're the asshole here.\n\nI need to consider the ethical and social aspects. The key points are: when should someone disclose their trans status, and is the author justified in their reaction. \n\nIn many cases, people disclose their trans identity when they feel safe and comfortable. The person here waited until the intimate moment to tell, which the author found shocking. But maybe the trans person had their reasons, like fear of rejection or being ready to share that part of themselves. \n\nThe author's reaction is based on their sexual orientation. They're straight and not attracted to vaginas. That's a personal preference, not a moral failing. The author isn't rejecting the person for who they are; they're stating their attraction. However, the way they framed it as being lied to and then losing attraction might come off as hurtful, even if unintentionally.\n\nThe author wants to stay friends but the trans person is upset. The author isn't in the wrong for not wanting to continue the relationship, but maybe they could have handled the situation more sensitively. However, the trans person's anger and accusations might be partly due to feeling invalidated or rejected in a way that's hurtful.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They're being honest about their feelings. The trans person's frustration is valid because they might feel they were treated as a mistake once the truth came out. But the author's attraction is their own, and they can't be blamed for that. The main issue might be about communication and timing of the disclosure, but the author's reaction is a personal choice based on their orientation. So the answer would be B (not in the wrong).\n"
