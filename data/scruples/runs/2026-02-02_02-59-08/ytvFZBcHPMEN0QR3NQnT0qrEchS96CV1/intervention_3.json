He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves them discovering their crush is trans and losing attraction, leading to a breakup.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author met someone they were dating, and during a sexual encounter, they found out the person is trans. The author feels they were lied to because the trans identity wasn't disclosed earlier. They now don't want to continue the relationship, and the other person is upset, calling them names. The author is questioning if they're in the wrong for ending the relationship.\n\nThe main issue here is about honesty and disclosure in relationships. Trans people often decide when to share their identity, especially in dating contexts. The author mentions that the person could have told them earlier, which makes them feel like they were lied to. However, it's important to note that not all trans people disclose their gender before becoming intimate, depending on their personal comfort and the dynamics of the relationship.\n\nAnother angle is the author's strict straight orientation. They explicitly state they're not attracted to vaginas and want a penis. That's a personal preference, and it's valid. But the problem here is that the author ended the relationship after becoming intimate, which might be seen as using the other person for a sexual encounter before realizing the truth. However, the author claims they were already in a dating relationship, so the disclosure timing is crucial.\n\nThe other person's reaction is also a factor. The trans person might have felt that the author was being discriminatory or insincere for not wanting to continue the relationship after learning about their trans status. There's a possibility here of transphobia, as the author is focusing on physical attributes rather than the person's identity. But the author isn't attacking the person's identity; they're stating their own preferences.\n\nLegally and ethically, there's no requirement for someone to disclose their trans status unless it's relevant to the relationship. However, in dating, especially when intimacy is involved, some level of honesty is expected. The author might have expected more transparency, but the trans person might have felt it was a private matter they weren't ready to share.\n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for having their preferences and ending the relationship based on them. However, the way they ended it, during an intimate moment, could be seen as harsh. But the trans person could have been more open earlier if it was a concern. It's a complex situation where both parties might have valid points, but the author's actions don't necessarily make them an asshole. They're expressing their preferences, even if it leads to hurt feelings.\n"
