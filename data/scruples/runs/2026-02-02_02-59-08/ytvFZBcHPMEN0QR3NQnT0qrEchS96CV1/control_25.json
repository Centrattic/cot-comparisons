He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the question is in the wrong. The scenario involves a trans person who didn't disclose their gender identity until a sexual encounter. The author feels lied to and isn't attracted anymore, leading to the relationship ending. The trans person is upset and calls the author names.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The key point is whether the trans person's failure to disclose their identity sooner was a lie. Trans people often disclose when they feel comfortable, but in relationships, certain details do come up. However, if they had been open from the start, the author might have made a different choice. Since the author identifies as straight and isn't attracted to vaginas, the trans person's gender is a dealbreaker for them.\n\nBut was the trans person deceptive? If they had been honest about their identity earlier, the author could have decided whether to pursue the relationship. However, the trans person might have been waiting for the right moment. The problem arises when the disclosure happens just before a sexual act, which can feel like a last-minute revelation. This can be hurtful because it's a significant aspect of identity that affects physical intimacy.\n\nThe author isn't being malicious; they have personal preferences. It's their right to know their attractions. The trans person might have felt vulnerable about their identity, but withholding such information until a sexual encounter can be seen as not being fully honest in the relationship. However, the author isn't in the wrong for ending the relationship based on attraction. They're not rejecting the person's identity but their own feelings. The trans person's anger and accusations might be more about their own hurt and insecurity. The author isn't manipulative; they're acting on their genuine feelings. So, the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
