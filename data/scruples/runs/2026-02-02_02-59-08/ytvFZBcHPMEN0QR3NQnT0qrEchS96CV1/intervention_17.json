He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author found out their crush is trans and lost attraction, leading to a breakup. The author's friend claims they're evil, and the question is whether the author is at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author mentions that they started dating their crush, who is trans. They didn't know about the person's gender identity until a sexual encounter. The author feels lied to because the person didn't disclose it earlier. The author is straight and not attracted to vaginas, so the attraction faded. They want to remain friends but the friend is upset and called them names.\n\nThe main issue here is whether withholding information about one's gender identity is a lie or a lack of communication. Gender identity is a significant part of one's identity. If the person is trans, they might have a valid reason for not disclosing right away, maybe due to fear of rejection or personal reasons. However, in a romantic relationship, especially when it's getting to a sexual level, such information is important. The author could argue they were honest about their straightness, but if the trans person didn't mention it, that might be a problem. However, the author also didn't ask about it, so maybe the responsibility isn't entirely on the trans person.\n\nThe author's feelings of being lied to might stem from not having the information when they chose to engage in a relationship. But if the trans person didn't feel safe or ready to share that aspect of themselves, it's not necessarily a lie. The author might be in the right to end the relationship once they realized their attraction was based on a mistaken perception. However, the way the author ended it\u2014maybe not being empathetic\u2014could be a problem. The author might be blamed for not considering the trans person's feelings when deciding to end the relationship.\n\nOn the other hand, the trans person's anger might be misplaced. The author isn't in the wrong for not wanting to continue the relationship if they're not attracted to the person's gender identity. It's their personal preference. The author isn't evil or manipulative for ending the relationship. The trans person might need to process their own emotions, but the author isn't at fault for not being attracted to them despite liking them as a person.\n\nSo, the answer would likely be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the author is honest about their preferences and made a choice based on their own feelings. The trans person may have withheld information, but the author isn't responsible for that. The author's actions are within their rights regarding their own feelings and attraction.\n"
