He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author finding out their crush is trans and then losing attraction, leading to a breakup. The author is questioning if they're an asshole for not continuing the relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author started dating someone they met at art school. They developed a romantic relationship, and during a moment of intimacy, the author discovered the person was trans. The author then stopped the encounter and later decided they were no longer interested in a romantic relationship, leading to conflict.\n\nNow, the main issue here is around attraction and honesty. The author feels lied to because the trans person didn't disclose their gender identity earlier. The author is straight and wasn't attracted to the person after discovering they were trans. The trans person is upset and made some harsh accusations.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's tricky. From the author's perspective, they felt deceived because the trans person didn't come out before they got into a serious relationship. However, the trans person might have had reasons for not disclosing earlier, maybe fearing rejection or not wanting to ruin the budding friendship. \n\nBut wait, in a romantic relationship, certain things are expected to be shared. However, the timeline is important. The author mentions that they had been friends for months and it evolved into a romantic relationship. The trans person might have felt the right time to disclose when they felt safe. But the author feels it was too late when it came up during a sexual encounter.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for ending the relationship. The author isn't saying the trans person is lying about being trans, just that they found out later than they would have preferred. Since the author is strictly straight, their lack of attraction is understandable. The author isn't denying the trans person's identity but is stating their own preferences.\n\nHowever, the author's reaction might be seen as harsh. The trans person could feel that the author is invalidating their identity by ending the relationship upon learning about their trans status. But the author is honest about their own sexual orientation. So, it's a matter of mutual honesty and expectations.\n\nThe trans person might have failed to communicate their identity early enough, but the author's decision to end the relationship isn't necessarily wrong because they can't change their attractions. The author isn't in the wrong for not being able to overcome their lack of attraction. The key point is that the author is honest about their feelings and isn't pretending to be attracted. They also want to remain friends, which shows they aren't dismissing the person entirely.\n\nOn the other hand, the trans person's anger and accusations of being evil could be seen as overreacting. The author isn't manipulating; they're being honest about their boundaries. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. The trans person's actions in not disclosing earlier might be at fault, but the author isn't the asshole for ending the relationship.\n"
