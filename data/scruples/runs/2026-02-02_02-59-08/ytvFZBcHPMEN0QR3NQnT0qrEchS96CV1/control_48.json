He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a person who discovered their crush is trans and then lost attraction, leading to a breakup.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author started a relationship with someone they thought was male, and later found out he's trans. They felt lied to because he didn't disclose this earlier. The author is strictly straight and isn't attracted to vaginas, so they ended the relationship. The trans person is upset, calling the author evil and manipulative, and the author is questioning if they're in the wrong.\n\nNow, I need to analyze this from different angles. Legally and ethically, when does someone need to disclose their trans status? In many places, there's no legal requirement to disclose, and the expectation can vary. However, in a romantic relationship, honesty is important. But the question is about when it should be shared. The author mentions they had been friends for months and the relationship developed into dating. The trans person might have felt the right time was during the romantic phase, but the author felt it was too late. \n\nThe author isn't saying the trans person is lying about their identity. Being trans is a valid gender identity, so the person isn't a liar but might have waited to share that part. The author's issue is about attraction based on their orientation. The author is clear they're straight and not attracted to vaginas. So their reaction is based on their personal preferences, not a judgment of the trans person's identity.\n\nThe trans person might have felt the relationship was progressing to a point where disclosure was necessary, especially when intimacy was about to occur. But the author felt betrayed because it was revealed during a sexual encounter. There's a communication breakdown here. The author could have addressed their attraction issues if the topic had come up earlier, but since it came up during a physical moment, they felt it was too late.\n\nThe trans person's anger and accusations might stem from feeling rejected or not accepted. However, the author is not being transphobic; they're stating their sexual orientation. The author is in a right to choose their romantic partners based on their preferences, even if that means the relationship can't continue. The key here is whether the author is in the wrong for ending the relationship because of their lack of attraction. Since the author isn't discriminating based on prejudice but rather their own orientation, they're not in the wrong. The trans person's right to self-identify doesn't obligate the author to change their feelings.\n\nAlso, the author tried to maintain the friendship, which shows they don't want to be cruel. The trans person's accusations of being evil and manipulative seem harsh and possibly a defense mechanism. The author isn't the one who withheld information; the trans person did. However, the author is also not the one who is transphobic. So the author isn't in the wrong here. Answer B."
