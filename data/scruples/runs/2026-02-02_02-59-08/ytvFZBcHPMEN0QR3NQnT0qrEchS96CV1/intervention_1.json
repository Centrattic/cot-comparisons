He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in the given situation. The scenario is about someone finding out their crush is transgender and losing attraction, leading to a broken relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the details. The author mentions they found out their partner was trans during a sexual encounter when they noticed there was no penis. The partner didn't disclose this earlier, and the author now feels lied to. They also mention not being attracted to vaginas and being strictly straight. The partner became upset, called the author names, and accused them of faking the friendship. The author is questioning if they're the asshole for not continuing the relationship.\n\nNow, the key points here. Transgender people often face challenges in disclosure, especially in a dating context. The partner might have been waiting for the right time to disclose, or maybe they felt it was too soon. However, withholding such a significant detail that could affect the relationship's dynamics is a point of contention. On the other hand, the author is questioning their own feelings and whether they're justified in feeling misled. \n\nFrom a social perspective, it's important to respect people's identities and transitions. However, the author's reaction is based on their sexual orientation. If being strictly straight means attraction is only to men, then the author isn't in the wrong for not being attracted to a trans woman. But the partner might feel that the author didn't give them a chance to disclose earlier, leading to the author ending things after the fact.\n\nThe author's actions: they didn't push for a relationship beyond what they were comfortable with. They tried to maintain a friendship. The partner's anger seems excessive, maybe indicating other issues. The author's problem is that the partner didn't disclose, leading to the author's loss of attraction when they learned the truth. \n\nIn terms of ethics, the author isn't being cruel or intentionally deceptive. They're honest about their orientation. The partner didn't disclose, which could be a problem in itself. However, the author isn't at fault for not being attracted to a different sex than they expected. So, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
