He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a crush who is transgender, and the author's attraction diminishes upon finding out.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author met someone, formed a friendship, and it turned into a romantic relationship. The author was attracted to the person, but when they found out the person is trans (assigned female at birth but identifies as male), the attraction faded. The author feels lied to because the person didn't disclose this earlier. The trans person became upset and accused the author of being manipulative. The author is now questioning if they're in the wrong.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether the author is at fault for ending the relationship after discovering something they consider important for their attraction. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the trans person's right to self-identify and their decision to share their identity when they felt comfortable. It's common for people to come out at different times, especially in a new relationship. They might have felt vulnerable or unsure how the other person would react. The author mentions that the trans person had months to tell them, but maybe the person wasn't ready to share that part of themselves yet.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's response is about their own feelings and attraction. They're not denying the trans person's identity but are stating that they are straight and not attracted to vaginas. The author is honest about their preferences. However, the way they discovered the information\u2014during a sexual situation\u2014might have been sudden and perhaps not the best time for either person.\n\nThe author's feeling of being lied to is understandable, but the trans person wasn't necessarily lying. They were living their true identity, and the author's lack of attraction is a personal preference, not something to be judged. The trans person might have hoped that the attraction would still exist despite their anatomy, but the author's feelings are valid as well.\n\nThe accusation that the author is evil or manipulative by the trans person is harsh, but it's possible that the trans person is hurt and feeling rejected. The author's decision to end the relationship but still maintain a friendship is reasonable, especially if they still respect the person.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't wrong for having specific preferences. However, the situation is complex. The trans person had the right to their identity, and the author had the right to their feelings. The author's reaction might be seen as honest, but the way they handled the situation\u2014ending the relationship after a romantic involvement\u2014might have been abrupt. But given that the attraction was a key factor, it's their choice. The author isn't in the wrong here because they're expressing their true feelings, even if it's difficult. The trans person's anger might be misplaced, as the author isn't responsible for their anatomy or for how they chose to come out.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong), but with the caveat that both sides have valid points. The author's actions are based on their own feelings and preferences, which are legitimate, even if the situation is uncomfortable.\n"
