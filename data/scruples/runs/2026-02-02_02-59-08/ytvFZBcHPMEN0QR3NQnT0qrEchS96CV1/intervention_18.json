He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author finding out their crush is trans and then losing attraction, leading to the end of their romantic relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author mentions they considered themselves straight and aren't attracted to vaginas. The trans person didn't disclose their identity until a very intimate moment, which the author found problematic. The author feels lied to because the trans person didn't come out earlier. However, the trans person might have struggled with when to reveal their identity, especially given the close friendship and budding relationship.\n\nLegal and ethical perspectives: In many places, it's illegal to discriminate based on gender identity. However, personal attraction is subjective. The author isn't in a legal wrong, but socially, there's a debate. Did the trans person have a responsibility to disclose earlier? It's tricky. Some people choose when to come out based on their comfort, and maybe they were scared or unsure. The author's reaction is about personal preference, which is valid, but the way they ended things might have hurt the trans person's feelings.\n\nThe author says they want to remain friends, which is positive. The trans person's reaction of anger and calling the author evil seems extreme, but that could be a result of feeling rejected. The author isn't intentionally discriminatory, just realizing their attraction isn't there after the fact. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? They didn't hide their orientation. They ended the relationship based on their feelings, which is their right. However, not considering the trans person's perspective might be a point. But overall, it's about personal preferences and how such information is shared. The trans person didn't lie; they just didn't disclose until a certain point, which the author found misleading. But attraction is subjective, and the author isn't obligated to change their preferences. So the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
