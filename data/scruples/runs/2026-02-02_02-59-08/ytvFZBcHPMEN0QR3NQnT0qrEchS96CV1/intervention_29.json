He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about a romantic relationship that ended when the author discovered their crush is transgender. The key points here are about attraction, disclosure, and how the relationship ended.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that they started a romantic relationship with someone they met at art school. They became close friends, and the relationship escalated to becoming dating-like. The author is straight and not attracted to vaginas, so when they saw that their crush didn't have a penis, their attraction faded. They stopped the encounter immediately and tried to talk it through, but the crush got upset, called them names, and now the author is wondering if they're the asshole.\n\nNow, the main issue is whether the author is in the wrong for not continuing the relationship after discovering the trans identity. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to assess the situation. \n\nI should consider a few angles. First, the concept of \"transitioning\" and when to disclose. Transgender people might disclose their identity at different stages. If the person was on hormone therapy or had undergone surgery, they might not have felt the need to mention it early on, depending on how open it is in their life. The author says he had months to tell them, implying he withheld that information. But maybe the trans person didn't feel ready to share that aspect of their identity, especially if they were still transitioning or not out to everyone. \n\nNext, the author's reaction. They felt lied to because the person didn't disclose earlier. However, if the trans person was living authentically as male and the author was attracted to him as a person, maybe the author made an assumption based on the person's presentation. The author's attraction to the person's male characteristics (like being a guy, the way he dresses, acts, etc.) might have been the basis of their interest. If the trans person wasn't masking their identity, but the author was under the impression they were cisgender, then the trans person might not be at fault for not correcting that early on. \n\nHowever, when the situation escalated to the point of sexual activity, the trans person's anatomy becomes a factor. The author might argue that the trans person should have disclosed before things got physical. But trans people often don't want to out themselves unless they feel safe and the relationship is established. It's possible the author assumed the person was cis based on their gender expression. \n\nThe other aspect is the author's current feelings. They want to remain friends but not pursue a romantic relationship because they're not attracted to vaginas. The author is being honest about their preferences. The trans person's anger and accusations of being evil or manipulative might be an overreaction, but that doesn't necessarily make the author in the wrong. The author isn't forcing the relationship; they're ending it because they're not interested. \n\nIf the trans person had disclosed their identity earlier, the author might have handled it differently. The author's problem is not about the trans label but about not being attracted to the person they're now realizing isn't a cis male. The question is whether the author is wrong for ending the relationship based on that. \n\nIn terms of consent and honesty, the trans person might have been in denial about their identity or not ready to discuss it. But the author's feelings are real, and they're not attracted to the person anymore. The author is also trying to be respectful of the trans person's journey. \n\nSo, the author is not in the wrong here. They made an honest mistake in assuming the person's anatomy, and when corrected, they acted on their genuine feelings. The trans person might have withheld information, but it's not clear if that was intentional deception. The author is being truthful about their lack of attraction and seeking to maintain friendship, which is reasonable. The trans person's reaction of calling them names is more indicative of their own feelings rather than the author's wrongdoing. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
