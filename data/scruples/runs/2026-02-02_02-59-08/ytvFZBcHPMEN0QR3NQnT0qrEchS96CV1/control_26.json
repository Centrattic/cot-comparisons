He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about a relationship where the author discovered their crush is trans and then lost attraction. The key points here are about honesty, boundaries, and mutual expectations in a relationship.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that they felt lied to because the person didn't disclose their trans identity earlier. But they also acknowledge that the person hadn't had a chance to come out until the relationship escalated. Trans people often have the right to their own timeline for disclosing their identity, especially if they're not out yet. So maybe the author's expectation that the person should have told them earlier is the issue here.\n\nThe author is straight and not attracted to vaginas, so this is a matter of personal preference. They feel that the person didn't be honest, but if the trans person was being truthful about their gender identity, then the author's reaction is based on their own preferences, not a lie. The author is not in the wrong for realizing their attraction is different after the fact. However, the way they handled breaking things off might matter. The trans person is upset and feeling rejected, which is understandable, but the author didn't fake the friendship. \n\nThe trans person's anger is more about rejection and possibly fear of being judged, which isn't the author's fault. The author isn't manipulative; they're expressing their feelings. The main issue is the author's assumption that the trans person lied, when in reality, the person was being honest but chose not to disclose before things became intimate. So, the author isn't in the wrong for ending the relationship, but maybe they should have handled the communication better. \n\nThe answer would likely be B, the author is not in the wrong. They have the right to their own preferences and can't be blamed for their reaction after discovering something important about their partner's identity. The trans person's frustration is valid, but the author isn't at fault here.\n"
