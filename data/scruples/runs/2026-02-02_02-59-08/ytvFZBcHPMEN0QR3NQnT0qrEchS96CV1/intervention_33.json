He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a crush who is trans and the author feeling less attracted after finding out. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author met someone at art school, became friends, then started dating. During a near-sex situation, the author discovered the person is trans. The author feels lied to because the trans identity wasn't disclosed earlier. They mention being strictly straight and not attracted to vaginas, so they ended the relationship. The crush is upset and accused the author of being manipulative.\n\nNow, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author is wrong, but I need to analyze it. \n\nImportant factors here: Did the trans person lie? The author didn't know until that moment. Trans people have the right to self-identify, but in dating, honesty is crucial. However, it's possible that the trans person might have come out earlier. But the author's reaction is that they felt lied to because it wasn't mentioned initially. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that they are straight and not attracted to vaginas, so they can't continue the relationship. Ending a relationship because of a change in attraction isn't inherently wrong. However, the way the author approached it might matter. They ended it after finding out during intimacy, which could be abrupt.\n\nBut the trans person might have had the right to not disclose until they felt comfortable. Yet, in a dating context, certain expectations exist about honesty regarding one's identity. If the trans person didn't mention their identity before becoming physically intimate, that could be seen as a miscommunication. \n\nThe author's reaction of feeling lied to might be valid if they expected full disclosure upfront, especially in a relationship moving toward sexual intimacy. However, the author might also be responsible for not asking questions or addressing their own boundaries earlier. \n\nThe trans person's anger and accusations of being manipulative could be a result of feeling rejected or disrespected. However, the author isn't the one who misrepresented their identity. The trans person might have felt scared to come out earlier, but that doesn't negate the author's right to end the relationship based on their preferences.\n\nIn terms of ethics, if the trans person didn't disclose, they might have been at fault, but the author isn't wrong for ending the relationship. The author isn't in the wrong for not continuing the relationship because attraction and personal boundaries are valid reasons. The author's mistake might be not communicating their own boundaries earlier, but the trans person's failure to disclose is a significant factor.\n\nSo, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong). The key points are the right to honest communication in relationships and the validity of personal preferences in attraction.\n"
