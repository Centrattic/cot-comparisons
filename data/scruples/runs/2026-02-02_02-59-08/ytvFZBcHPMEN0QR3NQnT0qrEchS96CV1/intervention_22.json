He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a romantic relationship that the author realized was with a transgender person, which led to a loss of attraction and ended up causing conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points: the author didn't know the person was trans until the intimate moment, felt lied to because the person didn't disclose earlier, and now the relationship is over. The author is questioning if they're an asshole for ending the relationship and not being attracted anymore.\n\nI should think about what the trans person's responsibility was. Trans people often face challenges with when and how to disclose their identity. There's no universal rule, but in many cases, people might wait until they feel comfortable or until the relationship is more established. However, in a romantic context, certain aspects like gender identity can be important for both parties. The author might have had the right to know earlier if this was a dealbreaker for them.\n\nBut then, the author also didn't ask during the months they were dating. If the author had specific preferences that would rule out a relationship with a trans person, maybe they should have communicated that earlier. However, not everyone is aware of their own preferences until they're in a situation. The author might not have known their own stance until that moment.\n\nThe person being trans was honest once the situation came up. The author is now feeling lied to but might have been given the chance to disclose earlier if they had been more upfront about their needs. However, it's also possible the trans person was protecting their identity and waiting for the right time.\n\nThe author's attraction faded after the disclosure, which is a personal response and not necessarily wrong. Feeling hurt by the other person's reaction is valid too. But the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The main issue is the lack of disclosure. If the author felt they needed that information earlier to make an informed choice, the trans person might have a responsibility to share that. However, in many cases, people don't have to disclose such personal information unless it's relevant and the other person asks.\n\nSo, if the author didn't ask and the trans person didn't think it was necessary until a specific moment, the author might not be in the wrong for ending the relationship based on their attraction. However, the author's reaction to the other person's anger could also involve their own communication issues. But the core question is about right or wrong. Since the author was honest about their feelings once they knew, and the trans person didn't disclose earlier, it's a bit of a gray area. But I think the author isn't in the wrong here because attraction can change upon new information, and they weren't asked to disclose until the intimate moment. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
