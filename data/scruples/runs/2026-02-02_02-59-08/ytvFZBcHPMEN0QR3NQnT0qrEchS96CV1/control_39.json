He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down the situation. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The scenario involves a romantic relationship where one person discovered their partner is transgender and then lost attraction, leading to a breakup and conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the timeline. The trans person didn't disclose their gender identity early on. The author felt lied to because they believe it's an important aspect that affects their attraction. The trans person might have felt it was the right time to come out or maybe feared rejection. The key here is whether withholding such significant information is a form of deception. \n\nNext, the author's reaction. They stopped the relationship because of their strict heterosexuality. It's their personal preference, and they're not in the wrong for their feelings. But the trans person was in the process of transitioning, so the author's rejection could be seen as invalidating their identity. However, the author isn't obligated to change their preferences. \n\nThe trans person's anger and accusations might stem from feeling rejected and invalidated. Calling the author evil is extreme, but the author didn't force the relationship. The author wanted to remain friends, which is reasonable. The trans person's emotional response is understandable, but the author isn't at fault for their own feelings and the consequences of the relationship ending.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the trans person not disclosing might be a point of discussion, but the author isn't in the wrong for ending the relationship based on personal preferences. The author's mistake was not addressing the attraction issue earlier, but since they only realized it at the moment of disclosure, it's not entirely their fault. \n\nOverall, the author isn't in the wrong for ending the relationship because of personal attraction issues. The trans person's decision not to disclose earlier complicates it, but the author's actions are justified given their strict orientation. So the answer is B.\n"
