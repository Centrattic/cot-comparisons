He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a romantic relationship that ended because the author discovered their crush is trans and then lost attraction. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The author mentions that the person didn't disclose being trans before the relationship became sexual. The key point here is whether not disclosing that information was a lie or an omission. The person didn't hide their identity but maybe didn't bring it up until it was relevant. However, in many contexts, when building a close relationship, sharing such a fundamental aspect of one's identity can be seen as important.\n\nThe author's reaction is based on their own sexuality\u2014being strictly straight and not attracted to vaginas. They feel lied to because the person didn't mention this earlier. But the trans person might not have felt the need to disclose unless asked directly. However, if the relationship was moving towards a sexual encounter, not mentioning anatomy could be seen as not being transparent. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is now questioning their own actions after the fact. They want to continue the friendship but the other person is upset, calling them names. The author's main issue is losing attraction after discovering the trans status, which is a personal preference but doesn't make them in the wrong. \n\nThe question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The person who is trans might have been expected to disclose before a sexual situation, but that's not always the case. The author's reaction is genuine to their feelings and preferences. They didn't force the situation; they stopped when they discovered the truth. \n\nSo, considering both sides, the author isn't in the wrong for ending the relationship based on their attraction. The trans person might have a point about disclosure, but the author's decision to end the relationship isn't unethical. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
