He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the question is in the wrong. The situation is that they started a relationship with their crush, who is trans, and after finding out the person is trans, their attraction faded. Now they're friends but the trans person is upset and called them names. The author is wondering if they're an asshole for ending the relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author mentions they're strictly straight and not attracted to vaginas. The trans person didn't disclose their transition early on. The author found out during a sexual encounter, which probably felt like a betrayal. The trans person is upset and accused the author of being manipulative, which seems like a projection.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the trans person might have a right to feel hurt if they didn't disclose something important. But the author's orientation is a personal aspect. The question is whether the author is at fault for ending the relationship. \n\nTrans people often face social stigma, and disclosure timing can be tricky. The author might not have known the person was trans initially. But the trans person had months to explain their identity. On the other hand, the author's attraction is a personal choice, and they can't be blamed for not being attracted to a vagina if they identify as straight.\n\nThe author's actions seem to be based on their own preferences. They didn't force the relationship; it was mutual. The trans person's anger might stem from feeling rejected, but the author isn't in the wrong for being honest about their attraction. The key here is that the author isn't choosing to be transphobic, just straight. They're not wrong for not changing their orientation.\n\nSo, the answer is B. The author isn't in the wrong because their feelings are valid, and the trans person should disclose such information when appropriate. The author had the right to end the relationship if their attraction faded.\n"
