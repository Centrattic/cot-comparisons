He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a romantic relationship where one partner is transgender, and the other discovers this just before having sex, then loses attraction. The key points here are honesty in relationships and personal preferences regarding attraction.\n\nFirst, the trans guy didn't disclose his identity until the moment they were about to have sex. The author feels lied to because they believe this information was important and should have been shared earlier. The trans guy might have reasons for not disclosing earlier, maybe fear of rejection or personal struggles with coming out. However, withholding such a significant detail until the last second could be seen as dishonest, especially if the author had a right to know earlier.\n\nThe author's response is to stop the relationship and continue as friends. The trans guy is upset, calling the author evil and manipulative, which is a strong reaction. The author isn't being cruel; they're acknowledging their own attraction issues and honesty about their preferences. Being straight means the author isn't attracted to vaginas, so their reaction is based on personal preference, not malice. The key here is whether the author is obligated to stay in a relationship just because of friendship or past affection. \n\nThe author isn't forcing the trans guy to feel a certain way or hiding their own preferences. The trans guy's anger at the author's honesty might stem from feeling rejected, but that doesn't make the author wrong for being truthful. The author's mistake might be not being upfront about their own sexual preferences earlier, but the main issue here is the trans guy not sharing his identity in a timely manner. However, the author is within their rights to end a romantic relationship if they feel they can't overcome their attraction issues. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They acted based on personal feelings and honesty, even if it's painful for both parties. The trans guy's reaction is more about his hurt feelings, but the author isn't obligated to continue the relationship. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
