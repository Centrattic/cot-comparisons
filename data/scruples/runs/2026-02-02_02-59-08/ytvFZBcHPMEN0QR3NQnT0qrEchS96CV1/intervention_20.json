He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not being attracted to their crush after finding out he's trans. The situation is that they were dating, had a lot of physical intimacy, and during a moment of intimacy, the author realized the person is trans. The author then stopped the relationship, leading to conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author mentions they are strictly straight and aren't attracted to vaginas. They feel like they were lied to because the person didn't disclose being trans earlier. The trans person is upset, calling the author evil and manipulative, which is causing tension.\n\nNow, from a moral standpoint, is the author wrong? Well, the author didn't know the person was trans until that moment. The trans person didn't come out before becoming intimate. The author's reaction is based on their personal preferences in attraction. They're not rejecting the person for being trans, but because it affects their attraction. That's a personal choice, not necessarily wrong.\n\nBut the author is also dealing with the aftermath of not being honest. The trans person didn't disclose, which the author feels is a lie. However, the author might not have been aware of this aspect of the person's identity. The trans person might have had valid reasons for not coming out earlier, but that's another angle.\n\nIs it fair to say the author is in the wrong? If someone's attraction is based on biological factors, and they didn't know the person's status, can they be blamed? The author is honest about their preferences and tried to maintain the friendship. The trans person's anger seems more about rejection than the author's actions. The author isn't being malicious; they're reacting based on their own feelings.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is likely B (the author is not in the wrong). They didn't know, made their feelings clear after the fact, and aren't discriminating based on trans identity but rather their own attraction. The trans person's anger might be misplaced. The author isn't lying or being cruel; they're being honest about their preferences now that they know the information.\n"
