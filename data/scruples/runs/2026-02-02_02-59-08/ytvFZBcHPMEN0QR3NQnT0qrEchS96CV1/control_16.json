He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that they had a crush on someone who turned out to be trans, and after finding out, their attraction faded. They stopped the relationship, and now the other person is upset and calling them names. The author is wondering if they're the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author mentions they're straight and not attracted to vaginas. They found out during a sexual encounter that their crush was trans. The key point here is whether the trans person was being deceptive. The author feels lied to because the person didn't disclose being trans earlier. But wait, does the trans person have an obligation to mention their trans status upfront? That's a tricky question. Some people might feel they should disclose early, but others might not see it as relevant until the relationship progresses. However, if the trans person is on hormone therapy or has had surgery, maybe it's more apparent. But in this case, the author didn't realize until the encounter.\n\nAnother angle: the author is being honest about their feelings. They liked the person as a friend, developed a crush, but upon finding out they're trans, their attraction diminished. That's a personal preference. It's not about being offensive but about their own attractions. The author isn't saying trans people are bad; they just aren't attracted to vaginas. So maybe they're not in the wrong for feeling that way.\n\nThe trans person's reaction is intense\u2014calling the author evil and manipulative. That might indicate they felt betrayed, but maybe they also didn't disclose their status, which could be a problem. The author is trying to maintain a friendship but the other person is hostile. \n\nLegally and ethically, relationships require honesty. If the trans person didn't disclose something they thought was important, maybe they have some responsibility. But if they felt it wasn't necessary to mention until the relationship was more serious, that's a different perspective. The author's reaction is about their own loss of attraction, which is a personal choice. They aren't discriminating based on trans identity but on gender identity (preferring male over female). \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for not wanting to continue the relationship once they found out. They're being honest about their feelings. The trans person's anger might be about being rejected, but the author isn't the asshole for not being attracted. So answer B.\n"
