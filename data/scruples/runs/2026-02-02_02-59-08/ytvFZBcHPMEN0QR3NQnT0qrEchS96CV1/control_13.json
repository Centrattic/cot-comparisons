He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author finding out that their crush is transgender and then losing attraction.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author met someone they thought was male, developed a relationship, and later discovered the person is trans. They feel lied to because the person didn't disclose their trans identity earlier. The author is straight and not attracted to vaginas, so after finding out, their attraction faded. The trans person is upset and called the author names, leading the author to question if they're in the wrong.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether the author is wrong for not wanting to continue the relationship after finding out. The trans person might feel they were open about their identity eventually, but the author felt the information was withheld until a critical moment. \n\nI should consider the trans person's perspective too. Coming out is a personal decision and can be difficult. Maybe they were waiting for the right time or felt it was too early before. However, when you're in a romantic relationship, certain expectations about disclosure exist. If the author's orientation is strictly straight, then the trans person might have known that and maybe should have mentioned it earlier if it's a dealbreaker.\n\nBut the author is not in the wrong because their attraction is based on their orientation. It's not their fault for feeling that way. The trans person may have chosen the wrong time to disclose, leading to the author's discomfort. The author's response is about their feelings, not about the trans person's identity. The key is that the author isn't being offensive but is stating their preferences. The trans person's anger and accusations might be more about their own feelings of rejection than the author's actions being wrong.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong. They're acting based on their own preferences and the information they received at the time. The trans person might have handled the disclosure better, but the author isn't at fault for their reaction.\n"
