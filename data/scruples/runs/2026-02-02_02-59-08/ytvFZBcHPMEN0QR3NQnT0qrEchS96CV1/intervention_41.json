He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author discovering that their crush is transgender and subsequently losing attraction, leading to the end of their budding relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author and the trans person were in a relationship that escalated to the point of sexual intimacy. The author found out the person is trans during a sexual encounter. They feel lied to because the person didn't disclose their trans identity earlier. The author is straight and not attracted to vaginas, so the attraction faded. The trans person is upset and called the author names, leading to conflict.\n\nNow, I need to assess if the author is in the wrong. The main issue here is the timing of the disclosure. The author argues that the person had months to tell them before the relationship became physical. However, transgender individuals often choose when and how to disclose their identity. It's a personal decision and can depend on various factors like trust, comfort, and the relationship's progression. \n\nThe author's reaction is based on their sexual preferences. Being straight, they aren't attracted to vaginas, so the relationship isn't feasible. But the question is whether the author is wrong for ending the relationship after the disclosure. \n\nFrom a fairness perspective, the trans person might have felt ready to disclose when they were more comfortable or when the relationship was more serious. The author might not have been ready for that information until the relationship became sexual. However, the author's decision to end the relationship isn't necessarily wrong because they're following their own feelings and preferences. \n\nOn the other hand, the author could have been more understanding. The trans person might have been anxious about revealing their identity and chose not to until they felt secure. The author's immediate reaction of feeling lied to and the subsequent judgment could be harsh. But the core of the issue is mutual respect and communication. \n\nThe trans person's anger and accusations of the author being evil might be an overreaction, but the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for not continuing the relationship. Relationships require mutual compatibility, and if the author isn't attracted to the person post-disclosure, they have a right to disengage. \n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the author's actions are considered wrong. The author isn't wrong for having those feelings and ending the relationship. The trans person's disclosure timing is a separate issue, but the author's reaction, while perhaps abrupt, isn't malicious. The key is that people can't be forced into relationships they don't want, even if there's a misunderstanding or delayed information. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
