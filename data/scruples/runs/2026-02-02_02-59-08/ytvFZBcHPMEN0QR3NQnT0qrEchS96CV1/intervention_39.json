He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" story is in the wrong. The situation involves a romantic relationship that ended when one person discovered their partner is transgender. The author, who identifies as straight, lost attraction after the revelation and wants to stay friends but not pursue a romantic relationship anymore. The trans partner is upset and calling the author names.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the timeline. The author mentions they developed a romantic connection over months of friendship, leading to physical intimacy. The trans partner didn't disclose their identity until the moment of intimacy. The author feels lied to because the trans partner didn't come out earlier. However, the trans partner might have had reasons for not disclosing, like fear of rejection or not feeling it was the right time. \n\nNext, the author's reaction. They state they're strictly straight and aren't attracted to vaginas. That's their personal preference, which is valid. However, the way they approached the situation\u2014stopping the intimate moment and then deciding to end the romantic relationship\u2014could be seen as a natural response based on their preferences. But the issue is whether they were in the wrong for not continuing the relationship. \n\nThe trans partner's anger and accusations might stem from feeling invalidated or rejected, which is a common reaction when someone's identity isn't accepted. The author could be seen as not respecting the trans partner's identity by ending the relationship after intimacy was initiated, especially if the partner felt they were past the point where such a revelation would matter. \n\nBut on the other hand, the author argues that the trans partner didn't disclose important information in a timely manner, which could affect the author's consent to the relationship. The author might have been under the impression they were dating someone male, so the non-disclosure could be considered a breach of trust. \n\nI need to weigh these factors. The author's decision to end the romantic relationship isn't inherently wrong if their attraction is based on gender. However, the way they handled it\u2014stopping during intimacy and then ending things\u2014might have been abrupt. But the core issue is about the trans partner not disclosing their identity early enough. The author isn't in the wrong for not wanting to pursue a relationship with someone whose gender identity they aren't attracted to, even if it's after the relationship has started. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong because they're acting based on their genuine preferences, and the trans partner not disclosing earlier is a key factor. However, the author could have handled the situation more sensitively, but they're not the one in the wrong here.\n"
