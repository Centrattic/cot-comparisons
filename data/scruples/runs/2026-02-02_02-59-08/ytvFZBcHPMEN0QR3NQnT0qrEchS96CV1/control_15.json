He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author had a romantic relationship with someone they thought was a guy, but then found out he's trans. The author is straight and not attracted to vaginas, so their attraction faded. Now the person is upset and calling the author names.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author did something wrong. The key points here are disclosure, attraction, and communication. Did the person lie about being trans? The author says he didn't tell them until they were about to have sex. The trans person might have felt it was a good time to come out, maybe because they were close. But the author feels lied to because it was withheld for months. \n\nBut here's the thing: being trans is a part of someone's identity, and when to disclose that is a personal choice. Some people might feel it's important to share early, others might wait until they're more comfortable. However, if the trans person didn't correct the author's understanding of their gender early on, that could be seen as not being truthful from the start. But maybe they were in denial themselves or afraid of rejection. \n\nThe author is straight and can't overcome the attraction issue. That's a personal preference, and people's attractions are complex. The author isn't choosing to be in a relationship with a trans man because of his gender identity. The problem is the author now feels the person didn't disclose something important, but the person might have had their reasons for waiting. \n\nAlso, the trans person's reaction is extreme\u2014calling the author evil and manipulative. That's not healthy. The author hasn't done anything to manipulate them; they just can't be in a romantic relationship. The trans person might be in distress, but that doesn't make the author wrong. \n\nIn terms of ethics, the author isn't wrong for having their own boundaries and preferences. The trans person might have not been honest early enough, but that's on them. The author isn't responsible for the other person's feelings after the fact. The author is ending the relationship because of attraction issues, which is a personal choice, not a moral failing. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
