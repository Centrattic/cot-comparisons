He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong after discovering their crush is trans and losing attraction. The author met someone, developed a relationship, and then found out the person is trans. They stopped the intimate moment because they're straight and not into women. The crush is upset, calling the author evil and manipulative.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author mentions they were in a dating-like situation with physical intimacy. The trans person didn't disclose their identity earlier, but the author feels lied to. However, the author also acknowledges that the person had months to tell them. But maybe they didn't because they feared rejection or had other reasons. \n\nThe author is straight and not attracted to vaginas. They say that if the person had told them earlier, maybe they could have worked through it because they liked the person. But since the revelation came during a sexual moment, their attraction faded. The author wants to stay friends but the other person is angry and upset, even calling the author names.\n\nNow, from a rights perspective, trans people have the right to be who they are. However, in a relationship, honesty is important. Did the trans person lie? It depends on how they presented themselves. If they never mentioned their trans status but lived as a man, maybe they didn't lie, but there's ambiguity. The author might not have known to ask.\n\nThe author's reaction is that they're not attracted anymore. That's a personal issue. They are allowed to have preferences, even if they're not into women. However, the way the author ended the relationship might be abrupt. They stopped the intimacy but didn't explain properly? Or maybe the author is being honest about their feelings.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the author didn't lie. They acted on their feelings when they realized their attraction was gone. But the trans person might have felt they were being rejected because of their identity. However, the author didn't reject the person as a person, but their identity. The author is being honest about their sexual orientation.\n\nOn the other hand, the trans person might have had the right to disclose their status earlier. If they didn't, maybe they contributed to the misunderstanding. But trans people often face stigma and might have hesitated to come out.\n\nThe author wants to continue the friendship. The other person is being hostile, which complicates things. The author isn't trying to harm but is stating their feelings. So, is the author in the wrong? Probably not. They're acting on their authentic feelings, even if it's painful for the other person. But they could have handled the conversation better post-revelation. However, they did say they wanted to stay friends.\n\nSo the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
