He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe person started going to art school, met a guy they found attractive, funny, and had common interests. They became good friends and started dating. The author mentions that they were getting physically intimate, almost to the point of having sex. Then, during a make-out session, the author notices that their crush doesn't have a penis and learns he's trans. The author stops and feels like they were lied to because the trans person didn't disclose this earlier. Now the author isn't attracted anymore and wants to remain friends, but the crush is upset and calls the author evil and manipulative.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author says they're strictly straight, meaning they're only attracted to males. However, their crush is trans, which might mean he identifies as male but has a female anatomy. The author didn't know he was trans until that moment. The author feels that the trans person didn't disclose this information, which was important to them. The author is now not attracted and doesn't want to continue the relationship, which is causing conflict.\n\nNow, legally and socially, being trans is a personal identity. The crush might have chosen not to disclose because he presented as male, and the author didn't ask. However, in terms of honesty in relationships, some people might expect certain information to be shared. But others might argue that if someone doesn't ask, they can't assume the other person is hiding something. \n\nThe author's issue is that their attraction is based on gender identity, which they found out later. The author is now choosing to end the relationship because of that. Is that the author's fault? If the author is strictly straight, then their attraction is based on biological sex, which the trans person's anatomical reality didn't match. However, trans men can be male (in terms of identity) even if their anatomy is female. So if the author's attraction is based on anatomy rather than identity, that could be a problem. \n\nBut the author might not be in the wrong because they didn't know. The trans person might have chosen not to disclose, which complicates things. However, in a dating context, some people do consider it important to disclose their trans status early if it's something the other person would care about. If the author didn't ask, but the trans person didn't mention it, is the author in the wrong for not knowing? \n\nAnother angle: the author is not in the wrong for ending the relationship once they found out something important about their partner that affects their attraction. People have different deal-breakers. The author isn't rejecting the person for their identity but for a biological aspect they weren't aware of. \n\nThe trans person's reaction seems harsh\u2014calling the author evil and manipulative. That might indicate that the trans person felt betrayed, but maybe because they expected the author to stay. However, the author is just being honest about their feelings now. \n\nSo, putting it all together: The author didn't know the person was trans until the moment of intimacy. The author is honest about their preferences and is ending the relationship because of that. The trans person didn't disclose, which could be their fault. The author isn't in the wrong for ending the relationship because they can't be expected to know unless it's shared. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
