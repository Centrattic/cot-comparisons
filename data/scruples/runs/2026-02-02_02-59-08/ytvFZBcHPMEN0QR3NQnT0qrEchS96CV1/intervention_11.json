He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author found out their crush is trans, and this led to a loss of attraction. The author is questioning if they're an asshole for not continuing the relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author mentions that the other person is trans and that they discovered this during a moment of intimacy. The author feels like they were lied to because the trans identity wasn't disclosed earlier. They also mention that they're strictly straight and not attracted to vaginas, so after the reveal, their attraction faded.\n\nI should think about the ethics here. The trans person might have been waiting for the right time to disclose their identity, maybe fearing rejection or not wanting to rush into that conversation. The author is upset that it happened during a sexual situation, which could be a sensitive time to learn such a personal detail. However, the author also admits that the trans person had months to tell them earlier.\n\nAnother angle is the trans person's perspective. Transitioning or coming out is a significant process. They might have felt it was important to build trust before revealing that part of themselves. The author's reaction could be seen as invalidating the trans person's experience, but the author is also being honest about their own feelings and orientation.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The AITA (Am I the Asshole) format often looks at whether the person did something offensive or acted inconsiderately. The author is stating their feelings and boundaries, which is a personal right. However, the way they expressed their feelings might have been hurtful. The author also mentions that the trans person became angry and called them names, which complicates things.\n\nIn terms of consent and honesty, both sides have responsibilities. The trans person might have had a duty to disclose their identity before a sexual encounter, but the author might not have considered that the trans person was waiting for the right moment. The author's decision to end the romantic relationship isn't inherently wrong if they're straight, but the timing and the reaction might affect that.\n\nI need to check if there's any cultural or social context I should consider. In some cases, people might argue that the author should have been more understanding or that the trans person didn't disclose early enough. However, everyone has the right to their sexual orientation and the right to be honest about their identity.\n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for not being attracted to someone after learning they're trans. It's their right to have their preferences. However, the way the situation was handled could be a point of contention. The author might be at fault for not addressing this earlier or for the way they reacted, but the core of the issue is about personal boundaries and honesty. Since the author isn't discriminating and is being honest about their orientation, they might not be in the wrong. The trans person's anger might stem from feeling invalidated, but the author's reaction is about their own feelings.\n"
