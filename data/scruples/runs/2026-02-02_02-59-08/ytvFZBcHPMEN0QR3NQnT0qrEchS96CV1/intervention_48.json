He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, they're asking if it's their fault for finding out their crush is trans and then losing attraction. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, the situation: the author met someone at art school, they became friends, developed a romantic relationship. The author didn't know the crush was trans until during a moment of intimacy. The crush didn't disclose this earlier, and now the author feels lied to. They don't want to continue the relationship but still be friends. The crush is upset and called the author names like evil and manipulative.\n\nSo, the key points here are about honesty in relationships and personal attraction. The author felt that the crush didn't share an important detail that affects their ability to be in a romantic relationship. The author is straight and isn't attracted to vaginas, so the fact that the crush is trans (assuming he's a trans man who hasn't transitioned) is a deal-breaker. However, the author is now being accused of being manipulative, which seems unfair.\n\nNow, the author's main argument is that they were honest about their sexuality and only wanted to continue being friends. The crush, on the other hand, didn't disclose his trans status, which the author found important. The author isn't rejecting the person because they're trans but because it's not what they want. That's a personal preference, not a hate issue.\n\nBut wait, the author was in a romantic relationship where they didn't know the other person's gender identity. The crush didn't come out beforehand. Should he have told them earlier? Maybe, but it's also possible that he was still processing his identity himself. However, the author is now being blamed for not wanting to continue. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the author isn't lying or hiding their feelings. They made a decision based on new information that affects their attraction. Personal preferences about attraction are subjective. The author isn't discriminating based on trans identity per se but on their own sexual orientation. However, if the crush is a trans man who is medically transitioning (i.e., he has a penis), then maybe the author's confusion is misplaced. Wait, the author says the person doesn't have a penis. So if he's a trans man who hasn't undergone surgery, maybe that's why. But the author refers to him as trans, which might mean he was assigned female at birth and is transitioning. So the author's attraction is to penises, which he didn't have. So the author's lack of attraction is legitimate from their perspective. \n\nThe author isn't being malicious; they're being honest about their feelings. The crush's reaction seems disproportionate. The author isn't in the wrong for not wanting to continue the relationship. They are clear about their sexuality and aren't trying to harm the other person. They even want to maintain a friendship. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
