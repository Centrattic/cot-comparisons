He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a trans guy who didn't disclose his trans status before the author became romantically involved with him. The author then lost interest after discovering he's trans and wants to remain friends but not date anymore. The trans guy is upset and accused the author of being evil.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the timeline. The author and the trans guy were friends for months, developed a romantic relationship, and the trans guy didn't mention his status until right before a sexual encounter. The author feels lied to because they consider gender important for attraction. The trans guy might argue that he didn't feel the need to disclose until they were in a sexual situation, but maybe he should have been honest earlier if it's a significant factor.\n\nIn terms of ethics, honesty in relationships is usually emphasized. If someone's gender identity is a key factor in their partner's attraction, withholding that information could be seen as deceptive. However, trans individuals might have valid reasons for not disclosing earlier, such as fear of rejection or not feeling ready to come out. But since they were in a romantic relationship, the expectation for honesty might be higher.\n\nThe author's reaction is about personal preference\u2014being strictly straight and not finding vaginas attractive. That's their personal choice, and they're not wrong for having those preferences. But did the trans guy have a responsibility to disclose sooner? If the author's attraction is based on the person's gender, then the trans guy's failure to disclose could be seen as a breach of trust. However, if the trans guy had come out earlier and the author still chose to pursue a romantic relationship, that's a different scenario. But since the author only realized their preference after the fact, they're not necessarily in the wrong for ending the relationship.\n\nThe trans guy's anger and accusations might be hurtful, but his emotional reaction doesn't necessarily make the author wrong. The author isn't obligated to continue a relationship if their attraction is gone. The key is whether the trans guy was deceptive. If he didn't disclose his status until right before intimacy, that could be seen as withholding important information at a critical time. So, the author isn't in the wrong for ending the relationship based on their preferences. The answer would be B (No).\n"
