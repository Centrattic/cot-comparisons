He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for finding out their crush is trans and then losing attraction.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author and their crush were friends, then started a romantic relationship. They were about to have sex when the author discovered the crush was trans. The author feels like they were lied to because the crush didn't disclose their trans status earlier. The author is straight and not attracted to vaginas, so their attraction faded. The crush is upset and called the author names.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to decide. Let's break it down. \n\nThe key points are disclosure of gender identity and honesty in relationships. Trans people often face the question of when to disclose their identity. Some might wait until they feel comfortable, but in a romantic context, certain details like gender identity can be important. The author argues that the crush didn't mention it when they were getting close, leading to a situation where the author's attraction was based on a male identity, which they later found out wasn't the case.\n\nBut wait, being trans doesn't mean they were lying about their gender. Trans men have a male gender identity, so they might present as male and live as such. The author might not have known unless the trans person disclosed. However, if they were dating and considering a sexual relationship, certain anatomical differences would naturally come up. The author discovered this during intimacy, which could be a sensitive moment.\n\nThe author is now feeling betrayed, thinking the crush didn't disclose something important. But the crush might have felt it was personal and not necessary to share unless asked. However, if someone is trans, it's often recommended to be upfront about it early in a relationship to avoid misunderstandings, especially regarding physical aspects.\n\nThe author's response was to stop the relationship, which is their right. They're not attracted to vaginas, so the relationship wasn't a good fit. The crush's anger and accusations seem like a negative response, but the author isn't in the wrong for not continuing the relationship. The author isn't responsible for the crush's lack of disclosure; they can't be blamed for their own feelings and boundaries.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. They had the right to know about their partner's gender identity, especially as the relationship became more intimate. The crush's failure to disclose earlier is a key issue here, not the author's decision to end the relationship based on their attraction. Therefore, the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
