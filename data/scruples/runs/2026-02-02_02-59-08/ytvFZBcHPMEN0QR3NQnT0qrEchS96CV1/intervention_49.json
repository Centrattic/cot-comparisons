He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a trans man who didn't disclose his gender identity until a sexual encounter, leading the author to feel lied to and lose attraction. The author now wants to be friends but not pursue a relationship, and the trans man is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, being transgender is protected under anti-discrimination laws, so the author might be facing accusations of transphobia. But the author isn't necessarily being transphobic; they're stating they're straight and not attracted to vaginas. That's their orientation, which is valid unless it's based on prejudice. The key here is whether the author is wrong for feeling that way.\n\nNext, the trans man didn't disclose his identity earlier. The author mentions they had been friends for months before things became romantic. The trans man might have chosen the timing of disclosure, which could be a point of contention. The author felt lied to because the information was withheld until a sexual situation. The trans man's disclosure during a sexual encounter might have been inappropriate, but the author is now rejecting the relationship because of it.\n\nThe author is not obligated to be attracted to someone regardless of their gender identity. However, the way they reacted might be seen as hurtful. The author says they want to continue being friends, but the trans man is upset and called them names. The author might feel justified in their feelings, but the trans man's reaction could indicate he felt betrayed or disrespected.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? They're acting based on their sexual orientation, which is a personal preference. However, if their reaction is based on the trans man's identity rather than a genuine lack of attraction, that could be problematic. The author isn't necessarily wrong for their feelings, but they might be wrong in how they handled the situation. For example, dismissing the trans man's identity as a lie or treating him as a sociopath might be unfair. Still, the core issue is whether the author's rejection is valid.\n\nThe author's main argument is that the trans man didn't disclose early enough. If the trans man had told him earlier, maybe the author could have adjusted. But since it was during a sexual encounter, the author felt it was a lie. The author isn't in the wrong for not wanting to pursue a relationship if they're not attracted, but they might be wrong in perceiving the trans man's actions as deceptive without considering his reasons for disclosure timing.\n\nIn terms of societal views, many would argue that the author is being transphobic by prioritizing the male gender over the trans man's identity. However, the author isn't denying the trans man's identity; they're stating they are attracted to men, and the trans man's body doesn't align with that. It's a complex issue where both parties might have valid perspectives.\n\nThe answer hinges on whether the author is wrong for their rejection. If the author is being honest about their attractions and isn't transphobic, they might not be in the wrong. However, if their reaction is based on the trans man's identity rather than a genuine lack of attraction, they could be in the wrong. The trans man's disclosure timing is also a factor. If he waited until a sexual encounter to reveal his gender, that might be a breach of trust, which could justify the author's feelings of being lied to. But the author's subsequent behavior (calling the trans man a sociopath) is problematic.\n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't in the wrong for not wanting to be in a relationship with someone they're not attracted to, especially if they're honest about their orientation. However, the way they handled the situation and their judgment of the trans man's actions might be where they're wrong. But the question is specifically about the author's actions in the situation. Since the author is being true to their feelings and their orientation, even if the trans man is upset, the author isn't in the wrong. So the answer would be B for No.\n"
