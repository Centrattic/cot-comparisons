He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a romantic relationship that ended because the author discovered their partner is transgender and then lost attraction. The author is now being accused of being evil or manipulative by their ex.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author started a relationship with someone they thought was male, but later found out their partner is trans. The author identifies as straight and isn't attracted to vaginas. They feel like they were lied to because the partner didn't disclose their trans status earlier. The partner is upset and made hurtful comments.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. Legally and ethically, people have the right to their sexual orientation and preferences. The author isn't obligated to be attracted to someone if they identify as straight. The trans person might have a right to privacy, but in a romantic relationship, certain expectations exist about honesty regarding one's identity. However, it's also possible the author didn't realize the importance of this detail until the moment they saw the situation.\n\nThe author stopped the interaction and wanted to remain friends. They didn't force the situation and tried to be understanding of the partner's struggles. The partner, on the other hand, accused the author of being manipulative, which sounds like they're deflecting their own hurt. The author's reaction is about personal preferences and honesty in a relationship. Since the author isn't transphobic (they acknowledge the partner's challenges), their issue is about attraction rather than prejudice.\n\nIn relationships, compatibility is key. If one person's core attraction is based on specific physical traits, not being attracted after discovering that's not the case isn't the author's fault. The partner may have withheld information, but the author isn't in the wrong for ending the relationship when they realized they weren't compatible in that aspect. The accusations from the partner are the real issue here. So, the answer should be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong).\n"
