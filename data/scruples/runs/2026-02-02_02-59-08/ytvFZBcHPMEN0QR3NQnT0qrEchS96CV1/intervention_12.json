He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author met someone at art school, became friends, developed a romantic relationship, and during a sexual encounter, discovered that their crush is trans. The author then stopped the interaction, felt lied to, and now the crush is upset, calling the author names. The author is questioning if they're in the wrong for not continuing the relationship.\n\nKey points to consider: The author identifies as straight and isn't attracted to vaginas. The trans person didn't disclose their identity until the intimate moment. The author feels that the trans person withheld important information that affected their willingness to proceed. The trans person is upset and accused the author of being manipulative.\n\nNow, thinking about right and wrong here. The author's stance is that they're straight, which is their personal preference. However, the trans person's identity is a fundamental part of who they are. The question is whether the trans person was obligated to disclose this earlier. Trans people often face discrimination and may choose when and how to come out, depending on the situation. It's possible the trans person feared rejection or wasn't sure how the author would react, hence waiting until a closer relationship developed.\n\nBut the author is now feeling deceived because the disclosure came during an intimate moment. The author's argument is that the trans person didn't mention it earlier, which led to the author's discomfort. However, it's important to consider that the trans person might have felt safe to come out when they did. The author might not have been in the wrong for not wanting to continue the relationship once they knew, as attraction is subjective and based on personal preferences. But the way the author ended things could be seen as hurtful, especially if the trans person felt the information was withheld intentionally.\n\nOn the other hand, the author isn't in the wrong for their feelings or their sexual orientation. People have different preferences, and it's natural for attraction to change or diminish upon learning something significant. The trans person might have been wrong to not disclose earlier, but that's a different angle. The author's actions, while causing hurt, might stem from their genuine feelings rather than malice.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, both parties might share some. The trans person could have communicated their identity earlier, but the author's reaction, while understandable, could be seen as abrupt. However, the author isn't in the wrong for their lack of attraction or deciding to end the relationship. They didn't act maliciously; they acted based on their feelings once new information was revealed.\n\nSo, considering all this, the answer would be that the author is not in the wrong. They aren't at fault for their sexual preferences or for ending the relationship after learning something that affects their attraction. The trans person might have been at fault for not disclosing earlier, but the question is about the author's wrongdoing. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
