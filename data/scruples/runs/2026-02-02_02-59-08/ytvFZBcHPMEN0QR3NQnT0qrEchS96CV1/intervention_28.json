He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Ask the Internets\" (AITA) post is in the wrong. The situation is that they met someone, started dating, and then discovered their crush is trans. The author feels like they were lied to because the person didn't disclose being trans earlier, and now they're not attracted to them anymore. They want to remain friends but aren't into continuing a relationship, which has made the other person upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The person didn't disclose their trans identity before the relationship became intimate. The author feels betrayed because they consider being trans a significant factor in their attraction. The other person is now angry, calling the author names and suggesting he faked the friendship. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author's argument is that they were honest about their preferences (being straight) and that the other person didn't share a crucial detail. The other person's argument is that they trusted the author enough to not need to disclose upfront, maybe waiting until they felt more comfortable or the right time. \n\nNow, in terms of ethics or social norms, when does someone need to disclose their trans status? There's no one-size-fits-all answer. Some people might feel comfortable discussing it early on, others might wait until they feel a connection. The timeline here is important: they were friends for months, started dating, and the disclosure happened just before a sexual encounter. \n\nThe author argues that the trans person didn't tell them in time for them to make an informed choice. But the author is also admitting they are only attracted to men, not women. If the trans person is transitioning and presenting as male, maybe the author's assumption is that they're a cis man. If the trans person is non-binary or something else, maybe that's different, but the post says \"he\" is trans, so likely transitioning from female to male. \n\nThe author's problem is that they weren't attracted to a vagina, which they discovered during the intimate moment. The trans person's perspective might be that they're not a woman in their identity, so the author's reaction is based on the physical aspect rather than the person's gender identity. \n\nIs the author wrong for feeling that way? Not necessarily. People have different attractions, and it's okay for someone to realize they're not into a partner's body. The issue is whether the trans person withheld information. If the author is strictly attracted to cis men, then not knowing the trans status could affect their attraction. \n\nBut did the trans person have an obligation to disclose earlier? That's debatable. The timeline of the relationship matters. They were dating for a while, and the author didn't ask about it. Disclosure is a personal choice, and in some cases, people might not feel it's necessary unless the other person brings it up. However, if the author values knowing someone's trans status before becoming intimate, then not disclosing could be seen as a breach of honesty. \n\nThe other person's anger and accusations might be a reaction to feeling rejected, which is valid, but the author isn't obligated to stay in a relationship if their attraction is gone. The author's intention was to be friends and then date, so they might not be in the wrong for changing their feelings once they learned a new piece of information. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong for not continuing the relationship. They were honest about their preferences, and the trans person's disclosure timing was perhaps late for the author's comfort. The author's right to their own feelings and attractions is valid. Therefore, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
