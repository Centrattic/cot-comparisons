He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a guy finding out his crush is trans and then losing attraction, leading to a breakup and some conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author (the person in the scenario) discovered that his crush is trans, which is an important detail for him because he's strictly straight. He felt lied to because the other person didn't disclose this earlier. The trans person might have been transitioning or not discussed it, which is a personal decision. \n\nThe author stopped the relationship because he's not attracted to a vagina and wanted a penis. Now, the other person is upset, calling him names. The author is wondering if he's in the wrong.\n\nI should think about consent and disclosure. The trans person might not have felt the need to disclose their status upfront, especially if they were presenting as male and the author didn't ask. On the other hand, if the author had specific preferences, maybe he should have communicated that earlier. But the author argues that the trans person didn't tell him when they were close, which affected the relationship.\n\nIs the author wrong for ending the relationship? Well, attraction is subjective. If the author is straight and can't overcome that, he's not choosing to be in the relationship, which is his right. However, the way he ended it\u2014after finding out mid-encounter\u2014might be abrupt. But the trans person's disclosure timing is also a factor. The author might not be in the wrong for ending the relationship, as he's honest about his preferences. However, the trans person might feel disrespected, but that's a different issue.\n\nThe author's actions: He stopped the relationship because of a fundamental mismatch. The trans person's actions: didn't disclose earlier, leading to the author's discomfort. The main question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since attraction is personal and he's honest about his orientation, he's not in the wrong. The trans person's anger is more about the disclosure timing and the way the relationship ended, but the author isn't at fault for his feelings.\n"
