He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. So the user is asking if the author is in the wrong in a situation where they discovered their crush is trans and then aren't attracted anymore. The author is a straight person who went from friends to a sort of dating relationship, found out the person is trans during a moment of intimacy, and now the relationship is over. The trans person is upset and called the author names.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key factors here. The author mentions they are straight and not attracted to vaginas. The trans person didn't disclose their identity earlier, and the author feels lied to. The author stopped the physical relationship but wants to stay friends. The trans person is angry and upset, calling the author manipulative.\n\nNow, I need to evaluate if the author is in the wrong. The author's main argument is that they were honest about their preferences and that the trans person didn't disclose their identity in a timely manner. The author didn't force anything and actually stopped when they realized the situation. The trans person's reaction seems hurtful and possibly not helpful.\n\nBut wait, maybe the trans person had reasons for not disclosing earlier. Maybe they were scared, not ready, or felt it wasn't the right time. However, in a romantic context, certain information is important for intimacy. The author is entitled to know their partner's gender, especially when it comes to their own attractions. The author didn't act out of malice; they just realized they weren't attracted after the fact. \n\nHowever, the author could have approached the situation differently. Maybe they should have communicated their needs earlier if they knew they were strictly straight. But the trans person should have disclosed their identity when it became relevant. The author's reaction isn't malicious; they're being honest about their feelings. The author isn't in the wrong for not wanting to continue the relationship after finding out. The trans person's anger might stem from feeling rejected, but that doesn't make the author wrong. \n\nAlso, the trans person's accusations of being manipulative seem unfair. The author didn't manipulate; they had a genuine connection that changed after the disclosure. So, considering all this, the author is not in the wrong. They're being honest about their feelings and preferences. The trans person's reaction is hurtful, but that doesn't place the blame on the author.\n"
