He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for finding out their crush is trans and losing attraction. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author met someone at art school, became friends, then started dating. They were about to have sex when the author realized the person was trans. The author feels lied to because the trans person didn't disclose it earlier. The author is straight and not attracted to vaginas, so their attraction faded. The trans person is upset and accused the author of being evil.\n\nSo the key points here: the trans person didn't tell the author about their gender identity until the moment. The author is now rejecting the relationship. The trans person is angry and claims the friendship was fake. The author is wondering if they're in the wrong.\n\nI need to consider both sides. The author feels deceived because the trans person didn't share important info. But maybe the trans person was waiting for the right time to come out, or maybe they felt safe to share in the moment. The author is not attracted to trans people because they're straight. That's their preference, but is it wrong to not be attracted to someone regardless of their gender? \n\nThe author is saying that if the trans person had told them earlier, maybe they could have worked through the attraction. But since it was discovered during a sexual encounter, the author is now confused. The author is also trying to maintain a friendship, but the trans person is upset and accusing them. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the author isn't being offensive, just stating their attraction preferences. The trans person might have felt comfortable to disclose when they did, but the author felt it was too late. The author isn't rejecting the person for being trans, but for not being physically attracted in the way they expected. \n\nIn terms of ethics, the author isn't intentionally hurting the trans person, but the feelings are hurt. However, attraction is subjective. The author isn't wrong for not being attracted to a vagina when they're straight. The trans person might have expected to be open about their identity earlier, but maybe they were scared or unsure. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong. They're being honest about their preferences and trying to maintain a friendship. The trans person's anger might be more about feeling rejected and hurt, not necessarily the author's fault. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
