He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author discovering that their crush is transgender and subsequently losing attraction. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author and the trans person became close friends, developed a romantic relationship, and had a physical connection. The author didn't know the person was trans until they were about to have sex. The person was open about it during the interaction, but the author feels it was a lie because it wasn't disclosed earlier. The author is now distancing themselves, leading to conflict.\n\nNow, the main ethical questions here: Did the trans person have a responsibility to disclose their gender identity earlier? In many cases, people don't share such personal details until they feel comfortable. The author might not have asked, and it's possible they assumed the person was cisgender.\n\nNext, the author's reaction. The author states they are strictly straight and not attracted to vaginas. If that's their genuine feeling, they might not have chosen to pursue the relationship even if they knew earlier. However, the author is now facing feelings of being lied to, which is a valid emotional reaction. But is the author in the wrong for ending the relationship?\n\nFrom a societal perspective, the trans person's right to self-identify and their privacy matters. They might have chosen to share this information when they felt safe. The author's sudden loss of attraction upon discovery is a personal reaction, but it's not malicious. The trans person's anger and accusations of manipulation are concerning, possibly indicating emotional abuse or a desire for control.\n\nThe author's actions\u2014ending the relationship but wanting to remain friends\u2014could be seen as honest. They're not pretending they're still interested. The key here is consent and honesty from both sides. The author didn't lie about their attraction before knowing, and the trans person didn't disclose, which isn't necessarily deceptive unless there was a prior agreement to share such info.\n\nIn many cultures, gender identity is a deeply personal matter that individuals choose to reveal when they feel it's appropriate. The author's reaction, while leading to the end of the relationship, isn't malicious. They're acknowledging the trans person's identity and their own feelings. The trans person's response, however, seems more about deflecting blame or controlling the narrative, which shifts the focus from the author's guilt.\n\nConsidering all factors, the author isn't in the wrong for ending the relationship. They acted based on their genuine feelings and the information they had. The trans person's anger stems from the situation but doesn't make the author an asshole. The answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
