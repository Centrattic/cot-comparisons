He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the situation is about someone who had a crush on a guy who is trans, and when they found out he's trans, they lost interest. The guy is now upset and they're wondering if they're the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of the relationship. They were friends for months, developed a romantic connection, and things were progressing. The author didn't know about the trans status until it became a physical moment. The person didn't disclose this early on, even though it's a significant detail for the author's attraction.\n\nThe key points here: The author is straight and not attracted to vaginas. They feel lied to because the trans person didn't tell them earlier. The author stopped the physical interaction and explained their feelings. The trans person is now upset, calling the author names. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the author is being honest about their feelings. They didn't know the trans status until the moment, and even if they had known earlier, they might have still decided not to pursue a romantic relationship. The trans person didn't disclose their identity in a timely manner, which is a big factor here. \n\nBut wait, maybe the trans person felt it was a good time to come out when things were more serious. However, withholding such a significant detail for months before a physical encounter could be seen as misleading. The author's reaction is about their own attraction, which is valid. They're not forcing anyone to change their identity, just stating their preferences. \n\nThe trans person's reaction seems extreme. Calling the author names and faking friendship is not constructive. The author is trying to maintain a friendship but can't be in a relationship. It's about personal boundaries and honesty. The author isn't being malicious, just honest about their feelings. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. The trans person didn't disclose important information, and the author is right to prioritize their own feelings, even if it's not what the other person wanted to hear. Therefore, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
