He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" (AITA) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author was in a romantic relationship with someone who is transgender, and found out that the person is trans during a sexual encounter. The author then decided they're not attracted to their crush anymore and ended the relationship, leading to conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author mentions that they were in a dating relationship and that they considered themselves strictly straight. The trans person didn't disclose their identity until the sexual moment, which the author found problematic. The author feels lied to and is no longer attracted to them, which is understandable given their orientation. However, the trans person is upset and accused the author of being evil and manipulative.\n\nNow, thinking about trans rights and dating ethics. Transgender individuals often face significant discrimination and may struggle with when and how to disclose their identity. There's a common understanding that people should come out on their own terms, but in a romantic or sexual context, partners might expect certain disclosures before intimacy. However, the situation is complicated because attraction can be a personal choice, and the author's orientation is towards men, not women.\n\nThe author argues that the trans person had months to disclose their identity, but didn't. The author felt it was important information that wasn't shared until a critical moment. The trans person might argue that they waited until they felt a connection or feared rejection. But the author's reaction, while perhaps hurtful, is based on their own lack of attraction to women, which is valid for them. The author is not being offensive in stating their preference, even if it's not politically correct. However, the way the trans person reacted\u2014calling the author evil and faking the friendship\u2014seems extreme and possibly hurtful.\n\nLegally and ethically, there's a difference between deception and disclosure. If the trans person didn't intentionally mislead about their gender identity, but the author's understanding of their gender was based on the person's lived experience, then it's not a lie. However, the author might feel that the information should have been shared earlier, especially since they were planning to have sex. The author's decision to end the relationship is their right, but the way they handled it might have been harsher than necessary.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, there's a growing emphasis on respecting trans people's identities and choices about when to disclose. The author's strict stance on being straight might conflict with the trans person's lived experience, but that doesn't make the author wrong in their feelings. It's a matter of mutual understanding and boundaries.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for not wanting to pursue a relationship with someone they're not attracted to. However, their attraction is based on the person's gender presentation and biology, which isn't their fault. The trans person's reaction might be more about hurt and frustration than the author being an asshole. The author's main issue is their lack of attraction, which is a personal preference, not a moral failing. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
