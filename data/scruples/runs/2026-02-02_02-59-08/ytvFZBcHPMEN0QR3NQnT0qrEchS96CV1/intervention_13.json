He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. So the situation is that the person (the author) is involved in a romantic relationship with someone they later find out is trans. The author was not attracted to them anymore after discovering this and ended the relationship. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that they are strictly straight and not attracted to vaginas. So from their perspective, they had a crush on someone they thought was male, but when they found out the person was trans (I assume meaning they were assigned male at birth but transitioned?), there was a physical difference (no penis). That made the author lose attraction. \n\nNow, the trans person didn't disclose their identity earlier, and the author feels lied to. The trans person got angry and called the author names. The author is now questioning if they're the asshole for ending the relationship.\n\nI need to consider both sides. The trans person didn't disclose their status immediately. That's a big deal. But maybe they had reasons for not telling earlier. However, when you're in a romantic relationship, certain things are important to know. If the author's sexual orientation is strictly towards men (penises), then not knowing the person's trans status could affect the relationship. \n\nBut the author did know the person for months, was friends first, and then it became romantic. The trans person might have felt ready to come out at some point, maybe after building trust. But the author found out during a sexual encounter, which might have been a shock. \n\nIs the author in the wrong for ending the relationship? Well, the author isn't at fault for their sexual orientation. It's a personal preference. If the person wasn't attracted to women, that's their right. However, the trans person's actions could be questioned. Coming out during a sexual moment might not be the best approach. Also, the trans person's reaction seems harsh, calling the author names. That's not helpful.\n\nBut the author's main question is whether they're in the wrong. The author ended the relationship because they are not attracted to the person's anatomy. That's a valid reason. They might have feelings for the person as a human, but the physical aspect isn't there. So, they aren't being malicious. \n\nOn the other hand, the author could have been more understanding or tried to adjust, but it's not the author's responsibility to change their attractions. The trans person had the responsibility to disclose their status when they felt comfortable, but they didn't. \n\nSo in the context of the question, the author is not in the wrong. They are not evil or manipulative for ending the relationship based on their own preferences. The trans person's anger seems misplaced here. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
