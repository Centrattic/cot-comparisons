He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the person wrote about how they found out their crush is trans and suddenly aren't attracted anymore. They felt lied to because the person didn't tell them earlier. The key points here are about honesty in relationships and personal boundaries.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that they started a romantic relationship with someone they later found out was trans. The trans person didn't disclose their identity until the moment they were about to have sex. The author feels that this was a lie and that the person should have come out earlier. The author is straight and not attracted to vaginas, so the realization changed their feelings.\n\nNow, considering the trans person's perspective, maybe they were waiting for the right time to come out, or felt unsafe to do so earlier. But in a romantic context, not disclosing such a significant aspect before intimacy can be seen as a problem. The author felt misled because they didn't know this key detail about their partner. \n\nThe author's reaction is based on their personal preferences. They're not attracted to women, so the trans person's status changes their attraction. That's a valid personal preference. The author isn't rejecting the person for who they are, but for their gender identity, which they can't accept in a romantic context. \n\nThe trans person's anger might stem from feeling rejected after a relationship where they might have expected acceptance. But the author isn't in the wrong for having certain attractions. People have different boundaries, and the author isn't obligated to change their preferences. \n\nThe main issue is whether the trans person was honest enough. If the author had known from the start, they might have realized it wasn't a romantic fit. The fact that the trans person waited until the moment of intimacy to disclose their gender could be seen as withholding important information. \n\nHowever, the author also acknowledges that if the person had come out earlier, maybe they could have overcome the issue. But since it was a surprise, their attraction faded. The author isn't in the wrong for feeling that way. They're not being offensive; they're stating their personal limits. \n\nThe trans person's anger and accusations of being evil and manipulative seem disproportionate. The author isn't manipulating; they're being honest about their feelings post-revelation. \n\nSo, putting it all together: the author's preferences are valid, the trans person's timing of disclosure might be problematic, and the author isn't wrong for not wanting to continue the relationship. The answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
