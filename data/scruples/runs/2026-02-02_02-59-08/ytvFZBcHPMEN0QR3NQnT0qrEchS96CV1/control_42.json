He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the person had a crush on someone they met at art school, and they started dating. The guy turned out to be trans, and when the author found out during a moment of intimacy, they lost interest because they're strictly straight. Now the guy is upset and called them names, and the author is wondering if they're the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author mentions that they found out the guy was trans when they were about to have sex. They felt lied to because he didn't tell them earlier. The author is straight and not attracted to vaginas, so their attraction faded after finding out. The guy is upset and accused the author of being manipulative, but the author is just ending the relationship because their attraction is gone.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The guy didn't disclose his trans status until that intimate moment. The author felt it was a lie because he didn't tell them earlier. The author is making it clear they're not into women, so maybe they should have known beforehand? But on the other hand, the guy might have been waiting for the right time to come out, or maybe felt it wasn't necessary until they were more serious. \n\nThe key points here are consent and honesty. If the guy didn't disclose his trans status, was that a lie? Or was he waiting for the right time? The author felt lied to, which is a strong feeling. But being trans is a fundamental part of someone's identity. The guy might have chosen to come out later because he felt they were in a relationship and maybe didn't want to ruin the connection. However, not disclosing such a significant detail before intimacy might be problematic. \n\nOn the author's side, they're honest about their orientation. They're not attracted to women, so maybe they should have been upfront about needing the person to have a penis. But they might not have known the guy's status at the start. The author's reaction is to end the relationship, which is their right if they're not into it. However, the way they found out might have been abrupt, but the guy didn't tell him earlier. \n\nThe guy's reaction is also extreme\u2014he called the author names and accused them of faking the friendship. That's not healthy. But the author isn't in the wrong for not wanting to continue the relationship. The author isn't being manipulative; they're being honest about their feelings now that they know the truth. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They had the right to know about the person's trans status before moving into a sexual relationship. The guy didn't disclose it, which led to the author's loss of attraction. The author is not obligated to continue a relationship if they're not attracted to the person anymore. The guy's anger and accusations are more on his side. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
