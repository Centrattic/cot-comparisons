He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again to make sure I understand it properly.\n\nThe author starts by going to art school and meets a guy they find attractive. They become friends, develop feelings, and start a dating-like relationship with makeouts and cuddling. Then, when things get physical, the author notices the person doesn't have a penis and finds out they're trans. The author stops the interaction, feels lied to because the person didn't disclose this earlier. The author is straight and not attracted to vaginas, so their attraction fades. The trans person is upset, calls the author names, and the author is confused about whether they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The main issue is whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to continue the relationship after finding out about the trans identity. \n\nThe author mentions that their attraction was to a penis, and since the person is trans (assuming they have a vagina or have undergone surgery), the author isn't physically attracted. That's a personal preference, and people have different attractions. The author also says they might have been able to overcome this if told earlier, but since it came up during a physical moment, their attraction faded. \n\nThe trans person didn't disclose their identity earlier. The author feels lied to because there was no mention of this during the months of friendship. But the trans person might have been waiting for the right time or felt vulnerable. However, in a romantic context, certain information is usually shared gradually, and the author might not have pressed for it. \n\nThe author stops the interaction, which is their right if they're not comfortable. The trans person's reaction is hostile, calling the author names, which is not healthy. The author wants to continue being friends but not more. \n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? They're honest about their attractions. They didn't force anything. The trans person might have been evasive about their identity, but the author is acting on their personal preferences. \n\nIn terms of ethics, people have the right to their own attractions. The author isn't discriminating based on gender identity itself but on physical attributes. However, trans people often face stigma, so there's a sensitivity here. But the author isn't attacking the person for being trans; they're stating that their attraction is to a penis, not a vagina. \n\nThe author isn't in the wrong for feeling that way. They're also honest about their feelings. The trans person's anger might stem from feeling rejected, but that doesn't make the author wrong. \n\nSo the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
