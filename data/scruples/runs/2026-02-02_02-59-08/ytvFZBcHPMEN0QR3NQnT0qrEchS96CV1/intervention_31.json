He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for losing attraction after finding out their crush is trans. \n\nFirst, the situation: The AITA started dating a guy they met at art school. They became close friends, then started a romantic relationship with physical intimacy. During a moment of intimacy, the AITA discovered the guy is trans (presumably male-to-female). The AITA feels like they were lied to because the guy didn't disclose this earlier. They admit they're strictly straight and not attracted to vaginas. They want to remain friends but not pursue a relationship, but the guy is upset and called them evil and manipulative.\n\nSo, the key points here are: Did the trans guy lie or withhold information? The AITA feels that since they would have liked him regardless if he had told them earlier, but now they can't get past it. The trans guy might have felt that he didn't owe the AITA that information upfront, depending on how comfortable he felt. Trans people often struggle with when and how to come out, especially in a romantic context. \n\nThe AITA is questioning if they're in the wrong for not continuing the relationship. The user thinks the AITA is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides. The AITA didn't act maliciously; they had a change in attraction based on new information. They also want to stay friends. The trans guy's reaction seems harsh, calling the AITA names, which is not okay. \n\nBut is the AITA wrong for ending the relationship? The AITA isn't obligated to continue a relationship if their attraction is based on specific factors. The trans guy didn't necessarily lie if he identified as a man and presented as such. The problem is that the AITA's attraction is tied to having a penis, which they weren't aware of. The trans guy might have expected the AITA to be okay with his identity, but the AITA isn't. \n\nSo, the AITA isn't in the wrong for ending the relationship because they're not attracted to vaginas. They're honest about their preferences. The trans guy's anger seems misplaced. The AITA isn't manipulating; they're being honest with their feelings post-discovery. Therefore, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
