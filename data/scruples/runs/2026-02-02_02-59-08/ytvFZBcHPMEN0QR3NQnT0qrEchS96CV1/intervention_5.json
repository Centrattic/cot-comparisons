He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that they met their crush at art school, became friends, started dating, and during a moment of intimacy, the author found out the crush is trans. The author felt lied to because the crush didn't disclose this earlier, and now they're not attracted anymore. The author wants to be friends but the crush is upset and called them evil.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is straight and not attracted to vaginas. They realized that the crush is trans (assuming male to female, since the author expected a penis and found a vagina). The crush didn't tell them upfront. The author is asking if they're in the wrong for ending the relationship and not being attracted anymore.\n\nThe key points here are: Did the trans person lie by not disclosing their identity early enough? And was it the author's responsibility to figure out if their attraction is compatible with the crush's gender identity?\n\nIn many cases, people disclose their trans identity when they feel comfortable, especially in a relationship. But if the author's attraction is based on the person identifying as male (assuming the author is male), but the trans person is transgender (female to male or male to female?), wait, the author mentions finding a vagina, so the person is trans female (assigned male at birth). If the author is straight, they're typically attracted to cisgender women. But if the trans woman is presenting as female, maybe the author expected her to be a cis woman. However, in this case, the author didn't know she was trans until that moment. \n\nThe author feels like they were lied to because the person didn't tell them earlier. But the person might have been waiting for the right time or didn't feel safe to disclose. However, in a relationship where intimacy is involved, there's an expectation of honesty. If the person is trans, they might have wanted to share that information to avoid the situation the author is now in. \n\nBut is the author in the wrong for ending the relationship? The author isn't saying they're not straight anymore, just that they can't be attracted to a vagina. That's their personal preference. If they're not in the wrong for that, then maybe they're justified in ending the relationship. However, the way the author reacted might come off as hurtful, especially if the trans person felt they were being rejected for their identity. \n\nThe trans person might feel that the rejection is based on their gender identity, which is a form of transphobia. But the author is being honest about their attractions. There's a difference between being transphobic and being honest about one's preferences. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They might not be, because they're being honest about their attractions. But maybe they could have approached the situation with more empathy. However, the trans person also has the right to self-disclose at their own pace. The author's reaction might be seen as unfair if the person had already shared their identity in a different context. But in this case, the author found out during an intimate moment, which is not ideal. \n\nBut the author's main issue is about attraction, not about transphobia. They're not rejecting the person as a person, just their body. So, in terms of being in the wrong, maybe not. The author is not being malicious; they're just realizing their attraction isn't there. The trans person's anger might stem from feeling invalidated, but the author isn't obligated to overcome their natural feelings. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
