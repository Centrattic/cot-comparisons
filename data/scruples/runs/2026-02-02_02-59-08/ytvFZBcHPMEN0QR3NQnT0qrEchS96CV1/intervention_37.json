He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author found out their crush is trans and lost attraction, leading to the end of their relationship. The author is being accused by the other person of being evil and manipulative.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author mentions that they were in a relationship, but when they found out the other person is trans, they stopped being interested. The key points here are honesty in relationships and personal preferences. \n\nThe trans person didn't disclose their identity until the moment before intimacy. The author feels lied to because they believe that information should have been shared earlier. However, the trans person might have felt ready to share it when they felt comfortable. But the author is straight and wasn't attracted to a vagina, so the trans person being non-binary or transitioning might affect the author's attraction. \n\nBut wait, transgender people are still part of the gender they identify with. If the person is transitioning and living as male, maybe the author's issue is more about the biological sex. However, the author's main issue is that the trans person didn't disclose this information until the last moment, leading to the author's sudden lack of attraction. \n\nThe author is not in the wrong for having personal preferences. People have different attractions, and it's valid for the author to realize they're not attracted to the trans person in the way they thought. However, the way the author ended the relationship might be abrupt. They did stop the intimacy and had a conversation, but the other person took it as betrayal. \n\nBut is the author wrong for not continuing the relationship? The author isn't obligated to continue a relationship if they're not attracted. The problem is that the trans person felt the information was shared too late. The author might have made an assumption based on the trans person's appearance, thinking they were cisgender. \n\nIn terms of honesty, while it's important to share such information early in a relationship, the trans person might have had valid reasons for waiting. The author's reaction could be seen as hurtful, but they're not in the wrong for their own feelings. The key is whether the author acted in bad faith. The author didn't know before, and they tried to maintain the friendship. The other person's anger seems more about rejection than the author being wrong. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong for not being attracted and ending the relationship. They're not obligated to continue if they're not interested. The trans person might have made a mistake by not disclosing earlier, but that doesn't put the author in the wrong. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
