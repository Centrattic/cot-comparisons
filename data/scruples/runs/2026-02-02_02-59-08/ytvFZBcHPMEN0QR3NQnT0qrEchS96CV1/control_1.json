He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So, the user is asking if the person who wrote this question is in the wrong. The situation is about a guy (the author) who had a crush on someone he later found out was trans. They had been dating, and when the author discovered the person wasn't a man, he lost interest and ended the relationship. The other person is upset and called the author names.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The key points are: the trans person didn't disclose their status earlier, the author found out during a sexual encounter, and the author now feels the person should have told him before they got serious. The author is wondering if he's in the wrong for ending the relationship.\n\nNow, the question is about whether the author is at fault. From what I understand, being trans is a part of someone's identity, and it's not typically something you'd expect someone to disclose on the first date. But the author feels lied to because the person didn't mention it earlier, even though they were in a relationship. However, in many cases, people don't share such personal details right away unless it's relevant. The trans person might have felt the right time to come out was later, depending on their comfort level.\n\nThe author, who identifies as straight, isn't attracted to women. Since the trans person is transitioning or is a woman, the author's attraction to men might not align. It's possible that if the author had known earlier, he might not have pursued a romantic relationship. However, the author is now ending the relationship because of this revelation, and the other person is hurt.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the author isn't wrong for having a preference regarding attraction. People have different orientations, and some may only be attracted to cisgender people. That doesn't make them wrong. The trans person didn't hide their identity; they just came out at a point they felt comfortable. Choosing to end a relationship based on attraction is a personal decision, and unless there was deception (like pretending to be a different gender), the author isn't in the wrong.\n\nThe other person's reaction seems extreme. Calling the author evil and manipulative is a way to deflect their own hurt. The author is honest about his feelings and isn't trying to be cruel. He wants to maintain a friendship, which shows he's considerate.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is B (No, the author isn't in the wrong). He's following his feelings and isn't maliciously ending the relationship. The trans person's decision to come out later might be their personal choice, but it doesn't obligate the author to continue the relationship if he's not attracted to them now. Being honest about one's feelings is important, and the author is doing that here.\n"
