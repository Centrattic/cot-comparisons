He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a guy (the author) who had a crush on someone they later found out is trans. The author felt their attraction fade after discovering this and wants to stay friends but not pursue a romantic relationship. The trans person is upset and accuses the author of being evil and manipulative.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author states they're straight and not attracted to vaginas, which is their personal preference. They mention that the trans person didn't disclose their gender identity earlier, which made them feel lied to. The author stopped the intimate encounter upon discovering the trans identity, which was a natural reaction given their stated orientation. They also express a desire to maintain friendship but not continue the relationship.\n\nThe main ethical question here is whether the author is wrong for ending the relationship based on their sexual orientation. Sexual orientation is a personal aspect, and someone identifying as straight may not be attracted to people of a different gender. The trans person's disclosure timing is also a factor\u2014had they known earlier, the author might have made a different choice. However, the author didn't act maliciously; they were honest about their feelings once the situation arose.\n\nThe trans person's reaction seems more extreme. Calling the author names and accusing them of faking the friendship might be an overreaction. The author isn't hiding their feelings; they're upfront about their orientation. The trans person's anger might stem from feeling rejected or misunderstood, but that doesn't necessarily make the author wrong for prioritizing their own feelings and orientation.\n\nAdditionally, the author isn't trying to hurt the trans person but is processing their own emotions. It's important to recognize that people have the right to their attractions and can't be forced into a relationship. The author's desire to remain friends shows they still value the relationship, just not romantically.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the author isn't being deceptive or harmful. They're expressing their genuine feelings and boundaries. While the trans person may feel hurt, the author isn't in the wrong for being honest about their orientation, especially when it's a defining aspect of their identity. The key here is that attraction is personal, and people have the right to act according to their beliefs unless they're harming others intentionally, which doesn't seem to be the case here.\n"
