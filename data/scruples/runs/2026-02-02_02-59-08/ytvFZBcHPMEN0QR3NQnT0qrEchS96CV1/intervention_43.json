He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that they found out their crush, who they were dating, is trans and lost attraction, leading to a breakup. The author feels they weren't lied to but think the person should have disclosed earlier. The author is being called evil by the trans person, and they're wondering if they're the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author is questioning whether they're in the wrong for not continuing the relationship after finding out about the trans identity. The trans person didn't disclose being trans until the moment of intimacy. The author is straight and not attracted to vaginas, so the trans person's anatomy changed their feelings.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the main issue is whether the trans person had a responsibility to disclose their identity earlier. Trans people often struggle with when and how to come out, and it can be a deeply personal decision. Some might feel that it's not their responsibility to disclose everything upfront, especially if the relationship was progressing naturally. However, others might argue that certain aspects of identity are important to share before becoming intimate.\n\nThe author's perspective is that they were \"lied to\" because the trans person didn't mention it earlier. But in reality, the trans person might have been waiting for the right time or felt comfortable enough to share. The author's reaction is understandable given their attraction is to men, but the trans person's identity isn't a lie if they were honest about their gender. The trans person might have used a male pronoun and presented as male, which is their right. So the author's feeling of being lied to might stem from different expectations.\n\nThe author stopping the relationship once they found out is their right. Attraction is subjective, and people can't be expected to feel attraction regardless of circumstances. The trans person's anger and calling the author an evil person seems more about hurt feelings and possible insecurity. The author isn't in the wrong for not wanting to continue the relationship. They made a choice based on their attraction, which is personal and valid. The trans person's reaction might be a result of unmet expectations rather than the author's wrongdoing.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author is not in the wrong. They had the right to know about the trans identity, but the trans person's timing of disclosure is a separate issue. The author's decision to end the relationship isn't making them an asshole. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
