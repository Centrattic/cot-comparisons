She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for calling the police on their sister. Let's break this down.\n\nThe sister is described as narcissistic and materialistic, with behavior that's escalated. She yells a lot, is physically violent, and even hit her parents. The parents are enabling her by giving in to her tantrums. The author is concerned for their safety and that of their parents. They called the police the second time she committed domestic violence. The sister was arrested before, and the parents are upset with the author.\n\nSo, the main points are: the sister is abusive, the author is trying to protect the family, and the sister has a history. The parents are working class, and the author worked hard for their own education. The sister's actions are threatening, including threats with knives.\n\nLegally, if someone is in immediate danger, calling the police is justified. The author isn't making up a situation; there's a documented history of violence. The parents might not be protecting their kids from the sister, but the author is taking action to ensure safety. The sister's refusal to seek help adds to the problem.\n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong. The answer would depend on the context. Since the sister is violent and the author is acting in self-defense and to protect others, the author is likely in the right. The parents might be upset, but their responsibility to protect their children from abuse isn't being fulfilled, so the author's actions are justified. So answer B.\n"
