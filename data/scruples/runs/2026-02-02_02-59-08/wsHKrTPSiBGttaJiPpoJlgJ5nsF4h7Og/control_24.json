She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author called the police on their sister because of her violent and abusive behavior. The sister is described as narcissistic and materialistic, with a history of screaming, threatening family members, and even physically assaulting them. The parents are enabling her by giving in to her demands, and the sister has already been arrested once for domestic violence. The author's main concern is protecting their parents and themselves from harm.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. If the sister has a history of domestic violence and the author is genuinely in fear for their safety, calling the police would be a reasonable step. Domestic violence is a serious crime, and reporting it can be a responsible action to ensure safety. The fact that the sister was arrested before supports the idea that her actions are criminal, so reporting again isn't necessarily wrong.\n\nThen there's the family dynamics. The parents are upset because they think the author ruined their daughter's life. Maybe they feel protective of her or don't want to face the consequences of her actions. But the author is also in a difficult position, having to choose between their sister and their own safety. The parents have been enabling her by giving her what she wants when she throws tantrums, which isn't healthy. The author's actions might be seen as a necessary step to break that cycle.\n\nAnother angle is the sister's refusal to seek help. If she's unwilling to get treatment for her issues, despite the family's efforts, it shows a pattern of behavior that's not going to change without external intervention. The author's call to the police might be the only way to enforce some accountability.\n\nHowever, could there be a lack of understanding or a better approach? Maybe the author could have tried more steps before calling the police, like involving a counselor or social services. But given the sister's history of violence and threats, especially with knives, the situation seems urgent. The author's fear is valid, and they might not feel they have time for other steps.\n\nIn terms of morality, the author is trying to protect their family from abuse. While family ties are important, safety and well-being should take precedence. The parents might be angry, but their enabling could be part of the problem. The author isn't at fault for taking action to protect themselves and their parents from harm.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. They faced a dangerous situation and took the necessary legal steps to address it. The sister's behavior is clearly abusive, and the author's actions are justified in seeking help from authorities to ensure everyone's safety.\n"
