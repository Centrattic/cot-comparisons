She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who called the police on their sister is in the wrong. The situation is pretty intense. The sister is described as narcissistic, materialistic, and has a history of screaming, yelling, and even physical violence towards the parents. The author mentions that their parents are enabling her by giving in to her tantrums, and the sister has been arrested before for domestic violence. The author called the police again because they were scared for their safety and the parents' well-being.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. If someone's family member is committing a crime, like domestic violence or assault, calling the police is a legitimate action. The police are supposed to handle such situations to protect everyone involved. The sister's behavior, including threatening with knives and actual physical attacks, sounds like criminal activity. So, reporting that shouldn't be wrong.\n\nThen there's the family dynamics. The parents are upset because they feel like the author ruined their daughter's life. But the author's priority is safety. It's a tough spot for parents, but if their child is abusive, protecting them might not be the right choice. The author is trying to protect their parents and themselves from harm, which is a valid concern.\n\nThe sister's refusal to seek help and her aggressive behavior make it clear that she's not willing to change. The author's actions are likely a last resort after multiple incidents. While family relationships can be complicated, personal safety is paramount. The author isn't just being a tattletale; they're taking steps to prevent future harm.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They acted to ensure their family's safety, which is a responsibility. The answer should be B.\n"
