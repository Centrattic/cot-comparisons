She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The question is whether the author did the wrong thing by calling the police on their sister. \n\nFirst, the situation: The sister is described as narcissistic and materialistic, with a history of violent outbursts, including physical assault on parents and destroying property. She's been arrested before for domestic violence and this is the second time. The parents are enabling her by giving in to her demands after her tantrums. The author is concerned about safety, especially since the sister has threatened to use knives, and they no longer keep knives in the house. \n\nThe author called the police again, leading to the sister's arrest, and now the parents are angry, thinking the author ruined her life. The author is asking if they're an asshole for wanting to get rid of the sister.\n\nI need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, if the sister is engaging in domestic violence\u2014threats, physical assault, property destruction\u2014the author has a duty to protect themselves and their family. Calling the police in response to domestic violence is a reasonable action, especially if there's a history of it. The fact that the sister was previously arrested suggests this isn't a one-time incident. The author mentions fearing for their well-being, which is a valid reason to involve law enforcement.\n\nThe parents might be upset because they don't want their child to face legal consequences, but the author's safety and the parents' safety take precedence. The sister's refusal to seek help and the escalation of her behavior (including violence) support the author's decision. \n\nHowever, some might argue that the author could have tried other measures first, like more family intervention or legal protection orders. But given the repeated violence and threats, especially with a prior arrest, calling the police seems justified. The author isn't the one using violence, and they're acting to stop ongoing abuse. \n\nIn terms of family dynamics, it's a tough spot, but the author isn't in the wrong for protecting their family. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
