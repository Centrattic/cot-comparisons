She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who called the police on their sister is in the wrong. The situation is complicated. The sister has a history of narcissistic behavior, yelling, and even physical assault. The parents are enabling her by giving in to her demands. The author felt they had to call the police again because of the threats and fear for their safety.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts presented. The sister's actions include verbal abuse, physical assault, and threats with knives. The author mentions that this is the second time they've called the police, and the first time resulted in an arrest for domestic violence. The parents are upset because they think the author ruined their daughter's life. The author is frustrated because they worked hard for their education and don't want to be in a dangerous environment.\n\nNow, the key points here are: Did the author have a right to call the police? The sister's behavior is clearly abusive and threatening. The author's safety and their parents' safety are at risk, especially with the history of domestic violence. In many places, if someone is in danger or witnessing abuse, they can report it to the authorities. The author isn't the one being violent; they're seeking help to protect themselves and their family. \n\nHowever, the parents are upset because they feel the author is being harsh. But from a legal standpoint, if there's a credible threat of violence, calling the police is a responsible action. The author isn't the one causing harm here. The sister's actions are the root of the problem. The author's decision to involve law enforcement to prevent further harm seems justified. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author could have tried other avenues first, like formal mediation or legal measures through the court. But given the threats and past arrest, it's possible that the police involvement was necessary to stop the cycle of abuse. The parents' enabling might be part of the issue, but the author isn't at fault for wanting to protect the family from a dangerous individual. \n\nThe author mentions that the sister refused professional help, so there's no resolution from that side. The police were already involved once, and the sister's behavior continued, which indicates that the situation wasn't resolved. The author's action could prevent further harm. \n\nIn conclusion, the author acted to protect themselves and their family from a known abuser. The sister's actions are the main issue, not the author's response to it. So the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
