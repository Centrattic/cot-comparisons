She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who called the police on their sister is in the wrong. The situation involves the sister having narcissistic tendencies, being abusive, and the parents not taking action.\n\nFirst, the sister's behavior is pretty extreme: screaming, physical assault, threatening with knives. The author mentions their parents are working class and worked hard to fund the sister's education. The sister's actions have led to dangerous situations where the family fears for their safety. They've tried to get her help before, but she refuses. The author called the police a second time after the sister's arrest for domestic violence.\n\nNow, the key points here are the sister's history of violence and the author's intent to protect their family. The police were called because there was a genuine fear for safety, not out of spite. The parents are upset because they feel it's ruining the sister's life, but the author's priority was safety. Legally, if someone is in immediate danger, calling the police is reasonable. The sister had a prior offense, so this isn't the first time.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). The sister's actions are criminal, and the author acted to protect their family. The parents' anger is more about the consequences for the sister, but the author's responsibility is to their own safety. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
