She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who called the police on their sister is in the wrong. The situation involves a sister with narcissistic and abusive behavior, including physical assault and property damage. The parents are enabling her by giving in to her demands, and the author feels they had no choice but to call the police again after a previous arrest.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. If the sister is threatening violence, especially with weapons, and has a history of domestic violence, then calling the police is a reasonable step to ensure safety. The author mentions fearing for their own and their parents' well-being, which is a valid concern. The police are meant to handle such situations to prevent further harm.\n\nNext, the emotional and familial dynamics. The parents are upset because the author \"ruined her life,\" but the sister's behavior has been ongoing and escalated. The author tried other methods like seeking professional help, which the sister refused. The parents' inability to set boundaries might have contributed to the sister's continued problematic behavior. The author's actions could be seen as self-defense and protecting family members from abuse.\n\nHowever, there might be a nuance. The user initially thought the author was in the wrong, but based on the details, the sister's actions are severe. The author had a legitimate reason to involve authorities. So, the answer would be B (not in the wrong) because protecting oneself and others from abuse is justified. The parents' anger might stem from cultural or traditional views, but the author's safety takes precedence.\n"
