She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who called the police on their sister is in the wrong. The situation involves a 21-year-old sister with narcissistic and materialistic traits that have worsened after studying abroad. She yells a lot, is physically abusive, and has a history of domestic violence. The author called the police a second time because they feared for their safety and their parents' well-being. The parents are upset because they think the author ruined their sister's life.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legality. If the sister has a history of domestic violence and the author has credible threats (like using knives), calling the police is a reasonable step to ensure safety. Physical assault and threats are criminal offenses, so reporting them isn't wrong. The parents not wanting to take action might be due to family dynamics, but that doesn't negate the author's right to seek help.\n\nNext, the sister's behavior: if she's threatening violence, destroying property, and attacking family members, these are serious red flags. The author's concern for safety is valid. They mention she's refused help, which complicates things but doesn't excuse the behavior. The author's decision to involve authorities could be a necessary measure to protect themselves and their parents.\n\nThe parents' anger is about ruining their sister's life, but the alternative is living in fear and potential harm. The author's motivation is self-preservation and protecting family, which is understandable. Legally, calling the police on someone for threatening or committing violence isn't wrong, even if it leads to arrest. The sister's actions are criminal, so reporting them is a responsible action.\n\nPossible counterarguments: The author might have other options like involving social services or legal guardianship, but given the sister's history, the immediate threat, and refusal to seek help, police involvement seems justified. The parents' inaction doesn't absolve the author of responsibility to protect themselves.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong. They acted to prevent harm, which is a reasonable and lawful response. The sister's actions are the root issue here, not the author's attempt to seek help.\n"
