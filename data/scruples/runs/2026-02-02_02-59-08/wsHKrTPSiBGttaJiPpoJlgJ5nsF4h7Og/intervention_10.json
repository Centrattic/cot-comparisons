She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who called the police on their sister is in the wrong. The situation seems pretty intense. Let me break down the key points from the story.\n\nFirst, the sister is described as narcissistic and materialistic, with behavior that's gotten worse after being abroad. She yells a lot, is physically abusive towards the parents, and there's a history of domestic violence arrests. The parents are enabling her by giving in to her demands, which is causing the author to feel unsafe. They mention that the sister has threatened to use knives, so they don't keep any in the house. The author called the police again, leading to the sister's second arrest. The parents are upset, thinking the author ruined her life.\n\nSo, the author's actions were based on safety concerns for themselves and their parents. The sister's actions are clearly abusive and illegal. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for calling the police. \n\nIn many cases, calling the police to protect oneself and others from domestic violence is a responsible action. The sister's behavior is criminal, so reporting it isn't justifiable as wrong. The parents might not be happy, but the author's priority is safety. The sister refusing help and continuing abusive behavior doesn't help either. \n\nThe user initially thought the author was in the wrong, but based on the sister's actions and the author's justification for safety, it seems the author acted correctly. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
