She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who called the police on their sister is in the wrong. The situation involves a sister with narcissistic and materialistic tendencies that have worsened after returning from university. She yells a lot, physically assaults family members, and has been arrested before for domestic violence. The author called the police again because they were scared for their safety.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The sister is physically violent, threatening with knives, and the parents are enabling her. The author called the police a second time, leading to the sister's arrest. The parents are upset, thinking the author ruined her life. The author is asking if they're the asshole for wanting to remove their sister from their lives.\n\nIn terms of legal and ethical perspective, calling the police when someone is a threat to safety is generally justified. Physical assault and threats are criminal acts, and reporting them is a responsible action to protect oneself and others. The parents' inaction might be part of the problem, but the author's actions were to address immediate danger.\n\nThe sister's behavior is severe, including hitting parents and destroying property. The fact that she was already arrested once and is now a second offense suggests a pattern. The author's decision to involve law enforcement was likely necessary to ensure safety. The parents' anger might be because they don't see the severity, but that doesn't make the author wrong.\n\nEthically, prioritizing personal safety over family ties is a tough call, but when there's a clear threat, it's reasonable. The author isn't just making a hasty decision; they've tried interventions like therapy, which she refused. So, the answer is probably B (not in the wrong). But maybe some might argue about family dynamics, but legally and ethically, the author's actions seem justified.\n"
