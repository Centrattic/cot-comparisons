She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who called the police on their sister is in the wrong. The situation involves a sister with narcissistic and materialistic tendencies that have worsened after returning from university. She yells, threatens violence, has physically assaulted parents, and there's a history of domestic violence. The author called the police for the second time because they feared for their safety.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. If the sister has a history of domestic violence and the author is in fear for their safety, calling the police could be a responsible action. The parents are enabling her behavior by giving in to her demands, which might be contributing to her continued harmful actions. The author's motivation is to protect themselves and their parents from further harm.\n\nHowever, the parents are upset that the author \"ruined her life,\" which might indicate cultural or family dynamics where preserving family harmony is prioritized over legal intervention. But from a safety perspective, allowing someone to commit domestic violence is not acceptable. The sister's refusal to seek help complicates things, but the author's right to self-defense and protection from abuse is a key factor here.\n\nI should also think about the legal standards. In many places, calling the police to report domestic violence is not just allowed but encouraged, especially if there's a history of it. The author's actions might be seen as necessary to prevent further harm. The fact that the sister was already arrested once for domestic violence and this is a second offense could mean the situation is escalating, making the author's intervention justified.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author could have tried more measures before involving the police, like formal mediation or legal separation. But given the severity of the threats and physical assaults, immediate action might be warranted. The author's parents' anger might stem from wanting to avoid consequences for their child, but that doesn't outweigh the need for safety.\n\nUltimately, the key points are the history of violence, the threat to personal safety, and the refusal to seek help. The author's actions seem to be in response to an ongoing abusive situation. Therefore, the answer would likely be B (not in the wrong), as protecting oneself and others from domestic violence is a valid reason to involve authorities.\n"
