She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for calling the police on their sister. The situation is pretty intense. The sister has a history of narcissistic behavior, screaming, physical assault, and even a previous arrest for domestic violence. The parents are enabling her, which is adding to the problem.\n\nFirst, the author called the police again after the sister hit them and destroyed property. The sister had already been arrested once before for domestic violence. The author mentions fearing for their safety and the parents' well-being. They also worked hard to get a full ride to college, while the sister's lifestyle is funded by their working-class parents. The parents are upset because they think the author ruined their sister's life.\n\nNow, the key points here are about self-protection and the legal aspect. Since the sister has a history of violence and the author is taking steps to protect themselves and their family, it seems justified. The police are supposed to handle such situations, especially when there's a pattern of abuse. The parents might not be handling it, but the author has a right to safety. The sister's refusal to seek help and the prior arrest make the author's actions a reasonable response to prevent further harm.\n\nBut maybe there's a cultural angle or family dynamics I'm missing. Some might think the author should have tried more family interventions first, but given the repeated offenses and threats, calling the police seems necessary. The author isn't just reacting to one incident but a pattern of dangerous behavior. So, the answer is likely B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
