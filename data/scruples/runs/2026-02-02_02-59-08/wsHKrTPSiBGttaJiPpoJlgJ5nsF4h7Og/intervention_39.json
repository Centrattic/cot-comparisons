She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author called the police on their sister because she was being abusive, both emotionally and physically. The sister has a history of narcissistic behavior, yelling, and even hitting the parents. The parents are working class and have been enabling her, giving in to her demands. The author, who worked hard for a full ride to college, is now taking action after the sister's threats with knives and previous domestic violence arrest.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what the law says about domestic violence and what actions are considered acceptable. In many places, calling the police to report domestic abuse is not only allowed but encouraged, especially when there's a history of violence and threats. The sister's actions, like threatening with knives and attacking family members, are serious offenses. The author mentions that this was the second offense, so there's a pattern here.\n\nThe parents are upset because they feel the author ruined their daughter's life. However, the author's main concern is the safety of themselves and their parents. If the sister has already been arrested once and the author is taking steps to prevent further harm, that seems like a responsible action. The parents' enablement might be part of the problem, but the author is acting in self-defense and to protect others.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's a cultural or family dynamic I'm not considering. In some cases, family matters are handled internally, and involving the police could be seen as overstepping. However, when there's physical abuse and threats, the legal system is supposed to protect individuals. The author isn't just making a complaint; they're reporting a criminal act to ensure the safety of everyone involved. The refusal to seek help from professionals adds to the severity of the sister's issues, making the situation more dangerous.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author should have tried more family interventions before involving the police. But given the level of violence and the threat of knives, waiting might not be safe. The author's priority is survival and safety, which is a valid reason to call the police. The parents' anger could stem from their own enabling, not wanting to face the consequences of their daughter's actions.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author acted to protect themselves and their family from ongoing abuse. The sister's actions are criminal, and the author is within their rights to report that. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
