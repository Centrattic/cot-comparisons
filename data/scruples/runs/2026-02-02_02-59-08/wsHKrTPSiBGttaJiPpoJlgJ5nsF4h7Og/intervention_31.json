She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong for calling the police on their sister. The sister has a history of narcissistic behavior, screaming, physical assaults, and even a previous arrest for domestic violence. The parents are enabling her by giving in to her demands, and the author feels they had no choice but to involve the police again to protect themselves and their parents.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. If the sister has a history of domestic violence and the author has a genuine fear for their safety, calling the police is a reasonable action. Law enforcement exists to protect individuals from threats and violence. The author's actions might be justified as self-defense and protecting family members.\n\nThen there's the family dynamics. The parents are upset because they feel the author ruined their daughter's life. However, the parents themselves enabled the sister's behavior by not setting boundaries. The author might be taking a stand against abuse, which is a tough decision but necessary for their own well-being.\n\nThe sister's refusal to seek help and her destructive behavior add to the justification. The author isn't just overreacting; there's a pattern of harmful behavior. The police have already been involved before, indicating a recurring issue that needs intervention.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author could have tried other means first, like more family therapy or legal measures short of police. But given the severity of the sister's actions, including threats with knives, the author's decision to call the police seems like a last resort to ensure safety.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the author is prioritizing their own and their family's safety over maintaining family ties, which is a valid choice when there's ongoing abuse. The parents' anger might stem from cultural or emotional reasons, but that doesn't negate the author's right to seek protection.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's actions are a response to a dangerous situation. They're taking responsibility for their safety and that of their parents, which isn't the wrong thing to do. Therefore, the answer should be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
