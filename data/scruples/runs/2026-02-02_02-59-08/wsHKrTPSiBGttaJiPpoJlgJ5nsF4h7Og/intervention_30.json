She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author who called the police on their sister is in the wrong. The situation is pretty intense. The sister has a history of narcissistic behavior, yelling, and even physical violence. The parents are enabling her by giving in every time she throws a tantrum. The author called the police a second time because the sister had threatened them with knives and destroyed property.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. If there are credible threats of violence, like with knives, and actual physical assaults, then calling the police would be a reasonable step to ensure safety. The sister has a prior arrest for domestic violence, so this is a repeat offense. Legally, the author might be justified in seeking help to protect themselves and their family.\n\nThen there's the family dynamics. The parents are upset because they feel the author ruined their daughter's life. But from the author's perspective, they're protecting themselves from abuse. It's a tough spot because family relationships can be complicated, but safety is paramount. The sister's refusal to seek help or change her behavior is a red flag. The author might feel they have no other options left after trying to get her help that she didn't want.\n\nEmotionally, the author is probably exhausted and scared. The sister's behavior is abusive, and the parents aren't standing up to her. The author's actions could be seen as a last resort to stop the cycle of abuse. But some might argue that the author should have handled it differently, maybe through legal channels other than the police, like restraining orders. However, given the sister's history, calling the police seems like a direct way to enforce some consequences.\n\nOn the other hand, if the police were called without any actual incident during that call, maybe that's different. But here, the context mentions past threats and a previous arrest, so the author is acting on a pattern of behavior. The key points are the sister's violent acts, credible threats, and the author's fear for their safety. In such cases, law enforcement intervention is appropriate.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They\u2019re trying to protect themselves and their family from abuse. The parents might not see it that way, but the author's actions are a response to ongoing violence and threats. Therefore, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
