She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the person who called the police on their sister is in the wrong. The situation involves a sister with narcissistic and violent tendencies, including physical assault and property destruction. The parents are enabling her by giving in to her demands. The author called the police twice, leading to her sister's arrest for domestic violence. The parents are upset because they feel the author ruined their daughter's life.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. If someone is being physically assaulted and threats of violence with weapons are involved, calling the police is a reasonable response. Domestic violence is a serious crime, and the law is meant to protect victims. The sister has a prior arrest, which adds to the severity.\n\nThen, the family dynamics. The parents are enabling the sister's behavior, which might contribute to their anger towards the author. The author mentions working hard to avoid debt while the sister's parents funded her lavish education. This could create underlying tensions. However, the immediate issue is safety. The author's decision to involve authorities when there's a threat to their safety might be justified.\n\nEmotionally, the author is in a tough spot. Balancing family loyalty with personal safety is challenging. The sister's refusal to seek help complicates things because it shows a lack of willingness to address her issues. The parents' anger might stem from cultural or traditional views on family matters, where legal intervention is seen as a last resort.\n\nLegally, if there's evidence of domestic violence, the police should be involved. The author's actions could be seen as necessary to protect themselves and their parents. However, if there's a lack of evidence or if the calls to police were exaggerated, that could make the author at fault. But the details provided suggest real threats and prior arrests, which support the author's actions.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's decision to call the police seems justified given the history of violence and threats. The parents' anger might be due to differing perspectives on how to handle the situation, but from a legal and safety standpoint, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
