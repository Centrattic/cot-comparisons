She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who called the police on their sister is in the wrong. The situation involves a sister with narcissistic and materialistic tendencies that have worsened after returning from university. She yells a lot, is physically abusive towards the parents, and there's a history of domestic violence leading to an arrest. The author called the police again, which made the parents upset.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points. The sister is physically attacking the parents and threatening them with knives. The author mentions the sister has been arrested before for domestic violence. The author's actions were to call the police again, which led to another arrest. The parents are upset because they think the author ruined their daughter's life.\n\nNow, considering the legal aspect: if someone is engaging in domestic violence, including physical assault and threats, calling the police is a legitimate action. The author was concerned for their safety and their parents', which is a valid reason. The sister has a history of such behavior, so the author isn't exaggerating. \n\nThe parents are upset because they might feel protective of their child, but the sister's actions are criminal. The author's priority was safety, which is more important than parental feelings in this case. Also, the sister refused help, indicating she's not willing to change. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. From a moral standpoint, protecting oneself and family from abuse is right. Legally, reporting a crime is the correct action. The parents' disapproval doesn't negate the author's right to seek help. \n\nSo, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
