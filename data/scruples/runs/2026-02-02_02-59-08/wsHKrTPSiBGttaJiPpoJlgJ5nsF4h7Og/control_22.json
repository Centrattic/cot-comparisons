She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author who called the police on their sister is in the wrong. The situation involves a sister with narcissistic and materialistic tendencies that have worsened after returning from university. She yells a lot, threatens to hit the family, and has a history of domestic violence. The parents are enabling her by giving in to her demands, and the author took action by calling the police again, leading to the sister's second arrest. The parents are upset because they feel the author ruined their daughter's life.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. If the sister has a history of domestic violence and the author has genuine fears for their safety and their parents', calling the police could be a reasonable step. The sister has physically assaulted them and destroyed property, which are criminal acts. The author's actions might be justified as self-defense or protecting others.\n\nHowever, there's the aspect of family dynamics. The parents are upset because they think the author ruined their daughter's life. The sister's behavior is harmful, but the parents are enabling her. The author's motivation is to protect the family, which is a valid concern. They mention the sister refused help, indicating she's not seeking treatment. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author could have handled it differently, like seeking more mediation or family counseling before involving the police. But given the repeated incidents and the sister's refusal to change, calling the police seems a necessary step. The author's actions were to prevent further harm, which is a valid self-preservation measure.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? The sister's actions are clearly abusive, and the author had a duty to protect themselves and their family. The parents' enabling might be a separate issue, but the author's action was a response to ongoing threats and violence. Therefore, the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
