She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who called the police on their sister is in the wrong. The situation involves a sister with narcissistic tendencies, physical violence, and the parents enabling her. The author felt threatened and called the police again after a previous arrest.\n\nFirst, consider the sister's behavior. She's described as narcissistic, materialistic, and has a history of violence, including hitting parents and threatening with knives. The parents aren't standing up to her, which adds to the problem. The author's motivation was protecting their family, which is a strong factor.\n\nThe parents are upset because they think the author ruined their daughter's life. But the author's actions were to prevent further harm. Legally, calling the police when someone is a threat is legitimate. The sister's refusal to seek help also plays a role here. The author might not be at fault since they acted to ensure safety.\n\nHowever, maybe the author could have tried other avenues first, like more therapy or legal measures without police. But given the severity of the threats and past arrest, calling the police seems justified. So the answer is likely B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
