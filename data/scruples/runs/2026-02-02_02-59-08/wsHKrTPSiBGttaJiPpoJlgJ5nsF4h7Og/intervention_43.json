She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who called the police on their sister is in the wrong. The situation involves a sister with narcissistic and violent tendencies, including physical assaults and property damage. The author's parents have been enabling her by giving in to her demands, and the sister has a history of domestic violence. The author called the police for the second time because of genuine fear for their safety and their parents' well-being.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. If someone is being threatened with violence and has a history of domestic abuse, calling the police is a legitimate action. The police are supposed to handle such incidents, especially when there's a documented history. The sister was already arrested once, so the author's action could be seen as a necessary step to ensure safety.\n\nThen there's the family dynamics. The parents are enabling the sister by not setting boundaries, which could be contributing to the problem. The author's motivation is to protect themselves and their parents from further harm. The sister's refusal to seek help and her violent behavior make the situation more severe. The parents being angry at the author might be due to cultural or traditional values where family issues are handled internally, but the author's priority is safety.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the author is trying to prevent harm, which is a valid concern. The question is whether the action was justified. Since the sister has a history of violence and threats, the police involvement is appropriate. The author isn't the one causing harm; they're seeking help from authorities when family members aren't addressing the issue.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the author should have tried other means first, like moving out or finding another way to protect themselves. But given the severity of the situation\u2014threats with knives, physical assaults\u2014it's reasonable to involve law enforcement. The parents' anger could be due to misunderstanding or denial, but the author's actions are in self-defense and to protect others.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's actions were necessary to address the immediate danger posed by their sister. They are not in the wrong because they're taking steps to ensure safety when other methods have failed.\n"
