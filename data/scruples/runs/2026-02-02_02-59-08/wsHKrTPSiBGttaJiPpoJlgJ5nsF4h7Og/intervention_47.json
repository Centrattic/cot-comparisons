She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who called the police on their sister is in the wrong. The situation is pretty intense. The sister is described as narcissistic, materialistic, and has a history of screaming, physical aggression, and destroying property. The parents are enabling her by giving in to her demands, and she's even been arrested before for domestic violence.\n\nThe author called the police again because they were scared for their safety and their parents' well-being. The parents are upset because they think the author ruined their sister's life. The author is wondering if they're the asshole here.\n\nSo, first, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. If someone is being physically harmed or there's a credible threat of violence, calling the police is a responsible action. The sister has a history of domestic violence, including threatening to use knives. The author mentions that they and their parents fear for their safety. In such cases, reporting to the authorities is necessary to prevent further harm.\n\nOn the other hand, the parents are angry because they might feel it's a family matter. But if the sister's actions are criminal, then the police should be involved. The fact that the sister refused help and has a prior offense suggests that the situation is serious. The author's main concern is safety, not just annoyance. They worked hard to avoid burdening their parents with debt, which shows they care about their family's well-being.\n\nSo, the key points are the sister's violent behavior, the prior arrest, the credible threats, and the author's fear for safety. Calling the police in such a scenario is a reasonable response. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
