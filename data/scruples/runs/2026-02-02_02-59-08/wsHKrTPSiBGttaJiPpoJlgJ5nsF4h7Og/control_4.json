She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who called the police on their sister is in the wrong. The situation involves an older sister who has become increasingly narcissistic and abusive, including physical assault on parents and threats with knives. The parents are enabling her by giving in to her demands, and the author has done this twice to get her arrested.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the sister's behavior. Physical assault and threats of violence are serious issues. Destroying property and threatening with knives, especially after a prior arrest for domestic violence, indicates a pattern of dangerous behavior. The author mentions fearing for their and their parents' well-being, which is a valid concern.\n\nThe parents' reaction is anger towards the author for \"ruining her life,\" but the sister's actions are the root cause. The author tried to get help through professionals, which the sister rejected. Calling the police in cases of domestic violence and threats is a responsible action to ensure safety. \n\nHowever, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. Even though the sister's behavior is terrible, the author's decision to involve authorities might be seen as necessary for protection. But sometimes, people might argue that family should handle things internally, but when there's physical harm and threats, that's not just a family matter\u2014it's a legal one. \n\nThe key points are the sister's repeated offenses, the danger posed, and the author's intent to protect family. The parents' enabling behavior is a separate issue. The author isn't the one causing harm here, so they're not the asshole. Answer B makes sense.\n"
