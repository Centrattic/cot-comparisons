She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author called the police on their sister because she's been acting out, being abusive, and threatening the family. The sister's behavior is really bad\u2014yelling, physical assault, destroying property, even threatening with knives. The parents are enabling her by giving in to her demands after she throws tantrums. The author took action because they were scared for their safety and their parents' safety. The sister has a history of domestic violence, this is her second offense. The parents are upset with the author for ruining their sister's life.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. If someone is threatening violence or committing acts of domestic violence, calling the police is a legitimate action. The author mentions that the sister was already arrested once and this is the second offense. So legally, the author is probably not in the wrong here. The police should respond to threats and acts of violence.\n\nThen there's the family dynamics. The parents are enabling the sister's behavior by giving in every time she throws a tantrum. That's problematic because it's allowing her to continue her abusive behavior without consequences. The author might feel that they need to take matters into their own hands when the parents aren't addressing the issue.\n\nEmotionally, the author is justified in feeling that they're doing the right thing to protect themselves and their family. The sister's actions are not just annoying; they're dangerous. The fact that they no longer keep knives in the house because of the sister's threats shows the severity of the situation.\n\nHowever, the parents are upset that the author \"ruined their sister's life.\" But if the sister has a history of violence and refuses help, then allowing her to continue unchecked could be seen as more harmful. The author's actions might be the necessary step to ensure safety, even if it causes family conflict.\n\nThere's also the aspect of the sister being narcissistic and materialistic. While that's a personality issue, it's not an excuse for physical violence. The author's decision to involve the police is about stopping the violence, which is a valid reason.\n\nSo putting it all together, the author's actions seem justified. They were trying to protect their family from an abusive sibling, which is a serious matter. The parents' enabling and the sister's history of violence support the author's decision. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong here.\n"
