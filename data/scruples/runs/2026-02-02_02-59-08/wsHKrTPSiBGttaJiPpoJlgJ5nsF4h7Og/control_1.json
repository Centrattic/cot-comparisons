She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking if the person who called the police on their sister is in the wrong. The situation is pretty intense. The sister is described as narcissistic, violent, and abusive towards the parents. The author mentions that the sister hits parents, destroys property, and even threatened with knives. The parents are enabling her, giving in to her tantrums. The author has had to call the police twice, leading to an arrest for domestic violence. Now the parents are angry at the author for \"ruining her life.\"\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. If someone is engaging in domestic violence, including physical assault and threatening with weapons, calling the police is a reasonable step to ensure safety. The author mentions genuine fear for themselves and their parents, which is a valid reason to involve law enforcement. The sister's prior arrest suggests a pattern, so the author's actions might be justified to prevent further harm.\n\nThen there's the family dynamics. The parents are enabling the sister by not setting boundaries, which is problematic. The author is trying to protect the family, even if it causes tension. The sister's refusal to seek help and her violent behavior make it a serious issue. The author isn't just being difficult; they're responding to active abuse.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that calling the police is a drastic measure, but given the sister's history and the immediate threats, it's hard to see it as overreacting. The parents' anger might stem from their own enabling or cultural factors where family honor is important, but the author's primary responsibility is their own safety and that of their parents.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. They're taking necessary steps to address domestic violence. Answer B.\n"
