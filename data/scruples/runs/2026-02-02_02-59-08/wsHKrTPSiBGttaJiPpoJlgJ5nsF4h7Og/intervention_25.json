She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who called the police on their sister is in the wrong. The situation is pretty intense. The sister has a history of narcissistic behavior, screaming, and even physical violence. The parents are enabling her by giving in to her demands. The author called the police twice, leading to the sister's arrest for domestic violence. Now the parents are upset, feeling like the author ruined their sister's life.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. If the sister has a history of domestic violence and the author has genuine fears for their safety, calling the police is a legal action. The police exist to protect people from harm. The sister was already arrested once, so this is a second offense. The author mentions physical assault and threats with knives. That's serious. Legally, the author is acting in self-defense and to protect their parents.\n\nBut then, maybe there's a cultural or family dynamic here. The parents are upset because they might value family harmony over legal consequences. They might feel that the sister's life is ruined now. But the author is trying to protect themselves and their parents from further harm. The sister refuses help, so there's no other option. The author isn't just doing this for spite; they have a legitimate fear. \n\nThe sister's behavior is escalating. The author has tried other methods like getting her to seek help, but she refuses. So calling the police is a last resort. The parents, being working class, worked hard to fund the sister's education, but now they're being taken advantage of. The author's decision might be seen as necessary to stop the abuse. \n\nOn the flip side, maybe the author could have done something else first? But given the sister's history and the fact that she's been arrested before, there's a pattern. The author is acting to prevent future harm. The police are the appropriate authority here. So the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
