She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a sister who's acting really badly, and the author called the police on her again. The sister has a history of aggression, hitting parents, destroying property, and even threatening knives. The parents are enabling her by giving in to her tantrums, and they're upset that the author called the police because they think it ruined the sister's life.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. The sister's behavior sounds abusive and dangerous. Physical assault, threatening weapons, and repeated incidents leading to her being arrested before\u2014those are serious red flags. The author is in a situation where they feel their safety and their parents' safety are at risk. The parents are working-class and have been funding the sister's education, which might contribute to their reluctance to take a firm stand.\n\nThe author called the police a second time because the sister's actions are escalating. The sister refuses help, like seeing a professional or taking medication. The author's motivation is to protect their family, which is a common concern in domestic abuse situations. But the parents are angry because they feel the author is ruining the sister's life. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key here is whether calling the police was an appropriate action given the circumstances. If the sister was indeed engaging in domestic violence and threatening harm, then reporting it might be a responsible action rather than a wrong one. The sister's prior arrest suggests that this isn't the first time she's had legal consequences, which might mean the author was following through on necessary steps to ensure safety.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the author could have tried other methods first or that the police were overused. But considering the severity of the sister's actions\u2014physical assault, destruction of property, threats with knives\u2014it's possible that calling the police was the right step to prevent further harm. The author's parents' anger might stem from their own enabling behavior and fear of consequences for their child, which is a different issue.\n\nSo, putting this together, the author is acting to protect themselves and their family from abuse, which is a valid reason. The sister's actions are the problem here, not the author's response. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
