She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author called the police on their sister because of her abusive behavior. The sister is described as narcissistic, materialistic, and having escalated to physical violence and threats. The parents are enabling her by giving in to her demands, and the sister has a history of domestic violence.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. If the sister is threatening to attack with knives and has a prior arrest for domestic violence, then the author has a legitimate reason to call the police. Protecting oneself and family from violence is a legal right. The fact that the sister was arrested before and this is a second offense might mean that the police have a duty to intervene to prevent further harm.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the author is trying to protect their family from abuse. The sister's behavior is harmful, and the parents are not taking it seriously. The author's actions could be seen as necessary to stop the cycle of violence. However, the parents are upset because they think the author ruined their daughter's life. But isn't it the sister who's causing the harm? The author might be right in taking action to ensure safety.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author could have tried other methods first, like seeking legal help through a restraining order or involving social services. But given the immediate threat, calling the police is a direct and appropriate response. The sister's refusal to seek help and the ongoing threats make the situation urgent.\n\nSo, considering all factors\u2014the sister's violent history, threats, and the immediate danger to family\u2014the author's action seems justified. They're not the one in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
