She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is pretty intense. The user is asking if they're the asshole for calling the police on their sister.\n\nFirst, the sister's behavior is described as abusive. She's allegedly been physically violent towards the parents, destroying property, and threatening to use knives. She also has a history of domestic violence with a previous arrest. The author mentions that they feared for their safety and their parents' well-being. So, from a safety perspective, calling the police when there's a threat of violence seems like a reasonable step. The author isn't just reacting to loud behavior or tantrums but to actual physical threats and past arrests.\n\nThe parents are being criticized for enabling the sister by giving in to her demands. The author took action because the parents weren't addressing the situation. The sister refuses help, which adds to the problem. The author's motivation is to protect themselves and their family from harm. \n\nBut the parents are upset because they think the author ruined their daughter's life. There's a family dynamic here where the parents might prioritize their daughter's well-being over the safety of their other child and themselves. However, the author's actions are in response to immediate threats and a pattern of abuse. \n\nLegally, if there's a credible threat of violence, calling the police is a right and a responsibility. The sister's actions, if proven, constitute domestic violence. So the author isn't in the wrong for seeking legal intervention to protect themselves and their family. The parents' anger stems from different priorities, but the author's actions are justified in a legal and safety context.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
