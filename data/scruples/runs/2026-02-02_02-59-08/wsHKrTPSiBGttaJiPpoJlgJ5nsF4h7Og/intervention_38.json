She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for calling the police on their sister. The situation involves a sister with narcissistic traits, escalating behavior, and a history of domestic violence.\n\nFirst, the sister's behavior is described as abusive\u2014yelling, physical assault, destroying property, and threats with knives. The parents are enabling her by giving in to her demands. The author's decision to call the police is a second time, and the sister was previously arrested for domestic violence. The author is concerned for their safety and their parents' well-being.\n\nNow, considering the legal perspective: if someone is being physically threatened or harmed, calling the police is a reasonable action. The police are meant to protect individuals from domestic violence. The author mentions that the sister has a history of violence, so acting to prevent further harm isn't wrong. The parents might be upset because they don't want their child to face legal consequences, but their enablement could be a separate issue.\n\nThe user initially thought the author was in the wrong, but the sister's actions are clearly abusive. Protecting oneself and others from abuse is justified. So the author isn't in the wrong for seeking legal help to protect their family. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
