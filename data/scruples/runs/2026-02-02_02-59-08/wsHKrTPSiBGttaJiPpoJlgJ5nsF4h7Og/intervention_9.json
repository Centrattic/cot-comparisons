She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who called the police on their sister is in the wrong. The situation involves a sister with narcissistic and materialistic tendencies that have escalated after returning from university. The sister yells a lot, hits the parents, destroys property, and has a history of domestic violence. The author called the police the second time, leading to the sister's arrest. The parents are upset because they think the author ruined the sister's life.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. If the sister is physically assaulting family members, the author is within their rights to call the police. Domestic violence is a criminal matter, and reporting it is a responsible action to ensure safety. The sister's previous arrest means there's a history of abuse, which the author would be justified in addressing to prevent further harm.\n\nEmotionally, the parents are upset, but their unwillingness to set boundaries might have contributed to the sister's behavior. The author's motivation is self-defense and protecting their parents, which is understandable. The sister's refusal to seek help complicates things, but the author's actions are aimed at stopping ongoing abuse.\n\nHowever, the parents' anger suggests there might be family dynamics at play. Maybe they feel the author is overstepping or not giving the sister a chance. But given the sister's threats and actions, the author's concern for safety is valid. It's a tough situation, but legally and ethically, stopping domestic violence is justified. The author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing safety and following legal procedures.\n"
