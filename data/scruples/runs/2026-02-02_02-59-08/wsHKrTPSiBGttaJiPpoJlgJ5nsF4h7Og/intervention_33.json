She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this query. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for calling the police on their sister. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the sister has a history of narcissistic behavior, escalating to physical and verbal abuse. She hits the parents and destroys property. The parents are enabling her by giving in to her demands during tantrums. The author, having worked hard to earn a full ride to college, is now in a dangerous situation where they and their parents fear for their safety. The sister was arrested once before for domestic violence, and the author called the police again because of past threats involving knives. The parents are upset with the author for ruining their sister's life.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate this. Legally, if someone is in immediate danger or there's a history of domestic violence, calling the police is a responsible action. The author mentions fearing for their safety and past threats, which are valid reasons to involve law enforcement. The sister has a documented pattern of abusive behavior, making the author's actions a form of self-protection. The parents' anger might stem from not wanting to see their child face legal consequences, but that doesn't negate the author's right to seek help.\n\nHowever, there's a nuance here. The author might have tried other avenues like therapy, which the sister refused. The police response might be necessary when other measures fail. The key point is the safety of the family versus the sister's well-being. Legally, the author is within their rights to report a threat. Emotionally, the parents are conflicted, but the author's primary responsibility is their own safety. So, the answer is likely B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
