She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for calling the police on their sister. The sister is described as narcissistic, materialistic, and abusive. She yells a lot, threatens with knives, and has physically assaulted family members. The parents are enabling her by giving in to her demands, and the author feels they can't take it anymore.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and safety aspects. If someone is threatening violence or has a history of domestic violence, calling the police is a reasonable step to protect oneself and others. The sister has been arrested before, indicating a pattern. The author mentions fearing for their safety and that of their parents, which is a valid reason to involve law enforcement.\n\nBut there's also the family dynamic. The parents are upset because they think the author ruined their sister's life. They might be in denial about her behavior or feel guilty. The author's actions could strain family relationships further, but the author's safety is paramount. \n\nIs there an alternative? They tried getting help before, but the sister refused. The police have been called twice, which shows escalating measures. In some cases, legal intervention is necessary when other steps fail. \n\nSo, the author is acting out of necessity to protect themselves and their family from abuse. While it's a tough decision, the priority is safety. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
