She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who called the police on their sister is in the wrong. Let's start by breaking down the situation. \n\nThe user's sister is described as narcissistic and materialistic, and her behavior has gotten worse after returning from university in Australia. She yells a lot, screams when she doesn't get her way, and even physically assaults her parents and destroys property. The parents are working class and have given in to her demands, even though they funded her expensive lifestyle abroad. The user, who earned a full ride to college, is now at the point where they called the police twice on their sister for domestic violence. The sister was arrested once before and now again. The parents are upset because they think the user ruined her life, but the user is concerned about their safety.\n\nFirst, the key points here are the sister's abusive behavior. Physical assault and destruction of property are serious offenses. The user called the police because they feared for their and their parents' safety. The sister has a history of domestic violence, which is a criminal issue. The parents are not protecting their children from this, instead enabling the sister's behavior by giving in to her demands.\n\nIn terms of legal and moral responsibility: if someone is in immediate danger or witnesses abuse, contacting authorities is often the correct action. The sister's actions are criminal, so reporting them isn't wrong. The parents' perspective is that the user ruined their sister's life, but from a legal standpoint, allowing abuse to continue without intervention can also be problematic. The user's own safety and that of their parents should be a priority.\n\nAnother angle: the sister refusing help and being in denial about her issues. This makes the situation more urgent. The user isn't just making a petty choice but acting to stop ongoing abuse. The parents' inaction is part of the problem. So, the user's decision to call the police is a responsible action to protect themselves and their family.\n\nPossible counterarguments: maybe the user should have tried more non-legal means first, but given the sister's history and refusal to seek help, legal intervention is necessary. Also, the police were called due to domestic violence, which is a clear legal matter. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the user is not in the wrong. They acted to protect their family from a dangerous situation. The sister's abusive behavior justifies the call to the police. The answer should be B.\n"
