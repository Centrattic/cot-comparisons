She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for calling the police on their sister. The situation involves a sister with narcissistic and materialistic tendencies that have worsened after returning from university. She yells a lot, threatens violence, and has physically assaulted her parents. The author called the police for her second offense, leading to arrest. Parents are upset, thinking the author ruined their daughter's life.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal and ethical aspects. If the sister has a history of domestic violence and the author has credible threats (like mentioning knives), calling the police is a reasonable step. The author mentions fear for their and their parents' safety, which is a valid concern. Legally, you have the right to protect yourself and others from violence. The sister's refusal to seek help complicates things, but that doesn't justify the abusive behavior.\n\nHowever, the parents are upset, thinking the author is ruining their daughter's life. But the sister's actions are harmful and illegal. The author's intervention might be seen as necessary to prevent further harm. The key points are the sister's past arrest, ongoing threats, and the author's right to safety. \n\nIs there any wrongdoing here? The author acted within their legal rights to report a crime. The sister's actions are the issue, not the author's response. So the answer would likely be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
