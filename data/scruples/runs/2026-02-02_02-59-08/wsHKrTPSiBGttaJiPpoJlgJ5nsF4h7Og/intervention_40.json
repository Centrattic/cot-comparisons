She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. Let's break down the scenario step by step.\n\nFirst, the author called the police on their sister. The sister has a history of narcissistic behavior, screaming tantrums, and even physical violence, including hitting their parents and threatening with knives. The parents are enabling her, giving in to her demands after she yells or throws tantrums. The author, who worked hard for a full ride to college, is clearly frustrated because their parents are funding the sister's lavish lifestyle. The sister has been arrested once before for domestic violence, and this was a second offense. The author's main concern is the safety of themselves and their parents, leading them to call the police again.\n\nNow, the author's parents are upset because they think the author ruined the sister's life. The author feels justified because they believe their sister is abusive and uncooperative with help. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, if there's a threat of violence and a history of domestic abuse, calling the police is a responsible action. The police are supposed to intervene in domestic violence cases, and the sister's actions (threats with knives, assault) are serious. The author's fear for their safety is valid, especially since their sister has a documented history. \n\nThe parents' enabling behavior is problematic. By giving in to her demands without consequences, the parents might be contributing to the sister's behavior. The author, in this case, is trying to protect the family from ongoing abuse. However, the author might have considered other steps first, like involving social services or a legal guardian, but given the urgency of the situation and the threat to safety, calling the police is a direct response to prevent harm.\n\nThe sister's refusal to seek help and her violent tendencies make the situation more severe. The author isn't just being a tattletale; they're addressing a real threat. The parents' anger might stem from their own issues with enabling their daughter, but the author's primary duty is to their own safety and that of their family.\n\nSo, considering all factors: the sister's abusive behavior, history of violence, the author's concern for safety, and the legal steps taken, the author is justified in their actions. Therefore, the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
