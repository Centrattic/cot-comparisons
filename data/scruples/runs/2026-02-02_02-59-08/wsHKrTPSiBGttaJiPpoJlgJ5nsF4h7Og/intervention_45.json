She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user wants to know if the person who called the police on their sister is in the wrong. Let me read through the details again.\n\nThe sister is described as narcissistic and materialistic, and her behavior has gotten worse after returning from university. She yells a lot, is physically abusive towards the parents, and there's a history of domestic violence. The author called the police for the second time because they were scared for their safety and their parents' well-being. The parents are upset because they think the author ruined their sister's life. The sister refused help, and the parents are working class, so they probably can't afford legal costs or have a strained relationship now.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the safety of the family. Physical abuse is a serious issue. The sister has been arrested before for domestic violence, so this is a recurring problem. The author acted to protect themselves and their parents, which is a valid concern. The parents might be in denial or not recognizing the severity. The author's actions were to prevent further harm, which is understandable. \n\nBut the parents are upset because they think the author ruined their sister's life. Maybe they want to protect her, or they feel it's a family matter. However, when there's domestic violence, especially with a history, calling the police is actually the right thing to do. The author isn't the one causing the violence; they're trying to stop it. The sister's behavior is the main issue here. The author's actions were to ensure safety, so they might not be in the wrong. \n\nI should consider legal perspectives too. In many places, you're encouraged to report domestic violence to protect everyone involved. The parents might be prioritizing their child's well-being over their own safety, but that's a different issue. The author's responsibility is to protect themselves and their family, so calling the police is appropriate. \n\nSo, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong). They acted to stop abuse and protect their family, which is a valid reason to involve law enforcement.\n"
