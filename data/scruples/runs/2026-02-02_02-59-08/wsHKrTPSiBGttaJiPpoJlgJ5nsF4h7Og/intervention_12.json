She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for calling the police on their sister. The situation seems pretty intense. The sister has a history of narcissistic behavior, screaming, physical violence, and even threatening with knives. The parents are enabling her by giving in to her demands, and the author is the one who finally called the police again, leading to her arrest. The parents are upset because they feel the author ruined the sister's life.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. The sister has a history of domestic violence, including physical assault and property damage. The author mentions that this is the second offense, and the sister previously had an arrest. The sister also threatened to attack the family with knives, leading them to remove knives from the house. The author's motivation is fear for their own and parents' safety. They tried to get the sister help, but she refused. \n\nNow, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. From a legal standpoint, calling the police when someone is threatening your safety is usually justified. If there's a history of abuse and threats, law enforcement would likely take it seriously. The author's action could be seen as a necessary step to protect themselves and their family from ongoing harm. \n\nHowever, family dynamics can complicate things. The parents might feel that the author is overreacting or causing harm to their sister's future. But the parents are also enabling the sister by not setting boundaries. The author might feel they have no other choice when the parents aren't willing to intervene. \n\nI should also consider the sister's perspective. She might have underlying mental health issues, but she refuses help. The author tried to get her assistance, which is commendable, but she didn't take it. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author's action is a response to a dangerous situation. They're prioritizing safety over family ties, which is a tough decision but not necessarily wrong. The parents' disappointment is valid, but their enabling is part of the problem. \n\nSo, the answer is likely B, the author is not in the wrong. They took action to protect their family after exhausting other options. The sister's behavior is the core issue, and the author's call to the police was a responsible step given the circumstances.\n"
