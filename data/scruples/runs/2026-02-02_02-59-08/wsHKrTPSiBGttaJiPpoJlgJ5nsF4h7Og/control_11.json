She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a sister who's acting out really badly. She's narcissistic, materialistic, yells a lot, even threatened with knives, and has hit their parents. The author called the police on her for the second time because they feared for their safety. The parents are upset, thinking the author ruined her life.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the sister's actions. If she's been physically violent, threatening with knives, and destroying property, that's serious. The author mentions she was already arrested once for domestic violence. So this is a repeat offense, which could indicate a pattern of dangerous behavior. In such cases, calling the police might be necessary to protect the family.\n\nThe parents are enabling her by giving in to her outbursts. The author might feel they have no other choice but to involve authorities. The sister refuses help, so there's no other intervention. The author's motivation is self-defense and protecting others, not just wanting to get rid of the sister. \n\nBut the parents are angry because they think the author ruined the sister's life. However, the author's actions were to stop ongoing abuse. The police were called because there's a threat to safety, which is a legitimate reason. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong here. But I should check if there's any legal aspect. If the sister has a history, the police might take it more seriously. Also, if the author had other options, like involving social services or other legal means, but if calling the police was the only way to ensure safety, then it's justified. \n\nSo considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
