She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the person called the police on their sister because she's been acting really poorly, right? The sister has a history of screaming, being narcissistic, and even physically assaulting their parents. The parents are enabling her by giving in to her demands, and the author's main issue is that the sister has hit them and destroyed property, leading to the police being called twice. The parents are upset because they think the author ruined their sister's life.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The sister's behavior includes physical violence (hitting parents, threatening with knives) and property damage. The author mentions a previous arrest for domestic violence. The parents are enabling her, and the author feels they're in danger, so they called the police again. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for doing that.\n\nFrom a legal perspective, if someone is threatening or physically harming family members, calling the police is a reasonable step to ensure safety. Domestic violence is a serious issue, and law enforcement is typically involved in such cases to protect victims. The author's actions could be seen as a necessary measure to prevent further harm. The parents, however, might feel that the sister is being unfairly targeted, especially if they've been enabling her in the past. But the author's priority is their safety and their parents' well-being, which is understandable.\n\nHowever, there's a nuance here. The sister's mental health issues might play a role. The author mentions that she refuses help, but it's unclear if she's been diagnosed with a condition. If her actions are due to a mental illness, there might be other interventions besides police involvement, like involuntary commitment, but that's more complex and might require legal steps. Still, when there's immediate danger, calling the police is appropriate.\n\nThe parents' reaction is also a factor. They might feel guilty or conflicted about their child being arrested, but their responsibility is to protect all children, including from each other. The author's decision to involve the police could be seen as a last resort after the sister's refusal to seek help and the escalation of violence.\n\nIn summary, the author acted to protect their family from immediate harm, which is a valid concern. While the parents might disagree, the author isn't in the wrong for taking steps to ensure safety. The sister's actions are the real issue here. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
