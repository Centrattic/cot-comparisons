She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author did the right thing by calling the police on their sister. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nThe sister, who's 21 and just back from university, has a history of narcissistic behavior, screaming, and throwing tantrums. The parents are enabling her by giving in every time. The sister physically attacks the parents and destroys property. The author mentions the sister has a prior arrest for domestic violence and threatens to use knives, leading the family to hide kitchen knives. The author called the police again, leading to a second arrest. The parents are upset because they think the author ruined their daughter's life.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the sister's violent behavior, the author acting in self-defense and to protect parents, prior arrests, refusal of help. The parents are in denial, enabling the sister.\n\nLegally, if someone is in immediate danger and another person is being abusive, calling the police is a reasonable action. The author's actions seem to be in response to a pattern of violence and threats. The sister's prior arrest shows this isn't the first time, and the author is trying to prevent further harm. The parents' enabling might be a separate issue, but the author's primary concern is safety.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The sister's actions are clearly abusive and illegal. The author's decision to involve law enforcement is a response to protect themselves and their family. Even if the parents are upset, the author isn't at fault for seeking legal intervention to stop abuse. So, the answer would be B (No) because the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
