She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who called the police on their sister) is in the wrong. The situation involves a sister with narcissistic and materialistic tendencies that have worsened after returning from university. She yells a lot, physically assaults parents, and threatened to attack them with knives. The parents are enabling her by giving in to her demands. The author called the police twice, leading to the sister's arrest for domestic violence. Parents are upset with the author for ruining her sister's life.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. The sister's actions\u2014physical assault, property destruction, threats\u2014sound like domestic violence. In many places, calling the police to protect oneself and family members is not only justified but encouraged, especially when there's a history of abuse. The sister's previous arrest for domestic violence suggests a pattern, which makes the author's actions a preventive measure for safety.\n\nHowever, the parents are upset because they feel the author ruined their daughter's life. That's a cultural or familial conflict. The parents might be prioritizing their child's reputation or future over the safety of the entire family. But legally, if the sister is committing crimes, reporting them is necessary regardless of family ties.\n\nEthically, the author is trying to protect themselves and their parents from harm. The sister's refusal to seek help and the parents' inability or unwillingness to set boundaries exacerbate the problem. The author's actions, while causing family tension, address the immediate danger.\n\nPossible counterarguments: Maybe the author should have tried more interventions before calling police. But the sister has a history and has not responded to previous attempts. The situation escalates to a point where police intervention is necessary for safety. Also, the sister has already been arrested before, so the author might be acting within legal rights to enforce consequences.\n\nIn conclusion, the author is not in the wrong because they are taking necessary steps to protect their family from abuse and following the law. The parents' anger stems from their own values, but the author's actions are justified in ensuring safety.\n"
