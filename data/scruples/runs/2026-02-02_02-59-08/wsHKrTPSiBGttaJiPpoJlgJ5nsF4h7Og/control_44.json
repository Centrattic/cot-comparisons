She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for calling the police on their sister. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the sister has a history of narcissistic behavior that's gotten worse after returning from university. She yells a lot, is physically abusive towards the parents, and has threatened to use knives. The author mentions she was arrested once before for domestic violence and this is her second offense. The parents are enabling her by giving in to her demands, even though they're working class. The author is trying to get her arrested again to protect themselves and their parents.\n\nNow, the parents are upset because they think the author ruined their sister's life. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nLegally, if someone is threatening violence, especially with weapons, and has a history of domestic violence, calling the police is a reasonable step. The author is in a situation where their safety and their parents' safety are at risk. The sister's behavior is escalating, and the parents are not addressing it, so the author took action. \n\nEmotionally, the parents might feel betrayed, but the author's actions are motivated by fear and a desire to protect the family. The sister's refusal to seek help or change her behavior makes the situation worse. The author isn't just calling the police out of spite; it's a response to ongoing abuse. \n\nIn these kinds of situations, the priority is safety. The author isn't the one being abusive; they're the one reporting the abuse. Even though it's a family issue, the legal system exists to protect individuals from violence and threats. The author's actions, while causing family tension, are justified in preventing further harm. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
