She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for calling the police on their sister. Let me break down the details.\n\nFirst, the sister is described as narcissistic and materialistic, with a history of screaming, yelling, and even physical violence against the parents. The author mentions that the parents are caving in to her demands, which leads to enabling her behavior. The sister has been arrested before for domestic violence and the author called the police again because of threats involving knives. The family is in fear for their safety, and the sister refuses help.\n\nNow, the key points here are about self-defense and safety. The author's actions were motivated by fear for their family's well-being. The sister's behavior is abusive and criminal, especially with the physical assault and destruction of property. The parents are working class, so the sister's excessive demands might be financially straining as well. \n\nBut why would the author be considered in the wrong? Maybe because they called the police instead of trying other methods first? However, the sister has a history of violent offenses and hasn't responded to other interventions like professional help. The author tried to get her help but she refused. The police were called to prevent further harm, which is a legal action when dealing with domestic violence.\n\nThe parents are upset because they feel the author ruined their daughter's life. But from a legal standpoint, the author might have been acting in self-defense and protecting others from a known abuser. The sister's actions are criminal, so reporting them isn't wrong. \n\nI need to check if there's any nuance I'm missing. The sister's behavior is clearly harmful, and the author's actions were to stop ongoing abuse. The fact that it's a family member might complicate things emotionally, but legally and ethically, the author is protecting themselves and their parents. The answer would be B (not in the wrong) because they're seeking help against domestic violence, which is a serious issue.\n"
