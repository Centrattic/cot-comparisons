She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for calling the police on their sister. Let me go through the details.\n\nThe sister is described as narcissistic and materialistic, with a bad temper. She yells a lot, screams, and physically attacks parents and destroys property. The author mentions that she's been arrested before for domestic violence, and now it's a second offense. The parents are enabling her by giving in to her tantrums. The author called the police out of fear for their safety, especially since the sister has threatened to use knives. The parents are upset because they think the author ruined their sister's life.\n\nSo, the key points here are the sister's abusive behavior, the author's fear for their safety and their parents', and the fact that the sister has a history of violence. The author took action by calling the police a second time. Legally, if someone is in imminent danger and there's a history of abuse, calling the police is a reasonable step. The parents' reaction is about protecting the sister, but the author's actions are about self-protection and safety.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. From a legal standpoint, reporting domestic violence is not wrong. The sister's actions are criminal, and the author has a right to seek help from authorities when threatened. The parents might be upset, but the author isn't the one causing harm. The sister is the one with the criminal history. So, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
