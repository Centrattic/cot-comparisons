She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a sister who's being really difficult, with narcissistic and materialistic behavior. She yells a lot, throws tantrums, and even hits her parents and destroys property. The parents won't stand up to her, and the author, who's worked hard to get a full ride to college, is fed up. They called the police twice, leading to her arrest for domestic violence, and now the parents are angry because they think the author ruined her life.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The sister has a history of violent behavior, including threatening with knives, which is serious. The author's actions were to call the police to protect themselves and their parents. The parents are upset because they think the author is ruining their daughter's life. But the author is in fear for their safety and the parents' well-being.\n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong for calling the police. In terms of legal and ethical considerations, when someone is in fear of their safety or others', reporting domestic violence is a responsible action. The sister has a documented history of violence, so the author is acting to prevent further harm. The parents might not be in the right for enabling the sister's behavior by giving in to her demands, but that's their issue.\n\nHowever, the author's method of handling it might be questioned. Could there have been other steps taken before calling the police again? The post mentions they tried to get her help before, but she refused. Since there's a prior arrest, maybe the legal system was already involved, and the author is following up on that. \n\nDomestically, families have complex dynamics. The author might be seen as taking a stand against abuse, which is necessary. On the other hand, the parents' anger could stem from cultural or personal beliefs about family loyalty. But protecting oneself from abuse is a priority. \n\nIn many cases, calling the police when there's a threat of violence is not only right but necessary. The author isn't the one committing violence; they're seeking help. So the answer would be B (author not in the wrong) if the focus is on safety. However, if the parents are upset and the author's actions caused family rifts, maybe there's nuance. But given the severity of the sister's actions, the author's decision seems justified.\n"
