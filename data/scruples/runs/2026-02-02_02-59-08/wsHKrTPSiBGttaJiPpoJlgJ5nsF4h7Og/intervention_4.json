She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is pretty intense. The sister is described as narcissistic, materialistic, and has a history of screaming, physical abuse, and damaging property. The author called the police twice because of this, and the sister was arrested once before for domestic violence. The parents are upset with the author for ruining their sister's life.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. If the sister was threatening with knives and there's a history of domestic violence, then calling the police to protect oneself and the family might be justified. Domestic violence is a serious matter, and law enforcement typically takes it seriously. The author mentions fearing for their safety, which is a valid reason to involve the police.\n\nThen there's the family dynamics. The parents are working class, have funded the sister's education, and are now reluctant to say no to her demands. The sister's behavior includes physical assault and property damage. The author worked hard to get a full ride to college, which adds to the stress of the situation. The parents seem to be enabling the sister's behavior by giving in to her demands, which isn't helpful.\n\nThe sister has refused help, which complicates things. The parents are upset that the author took legal action, but if the sister is a threat, the author's actions could be seen as necessary for safety. The question is whether calling the police was the right move given the circumstances.\n\nOn one hand, the author is trying to protect the family from a dangerous situation. On the other hand, the parents might feel that the author is being too harsh or not giving the sister a chance. But considering the sister's history, the author's actions seem to be in self-defense and to prevent further harm. The police were called due to actual threats and incidents, not just minor arguments. The author isn't just trying to control the sister; it's about safety. So, the author might not be in the wrong here. The answer would be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
