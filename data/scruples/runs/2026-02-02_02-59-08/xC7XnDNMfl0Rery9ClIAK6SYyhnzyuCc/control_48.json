Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for asking their wife to meal prep before a trip. The situation is that the wife is going away for a week, the first time since the kids were born. The husband is worried about handling the chores and cooking, especially since the kids are picky and the wife knows their preferences better. He asked her to prep the dinners for the week, but she got upset and said it's too much work. He thinks it's reasonable since she's the one going away, and he doesn't want mealtime meltdowns.\n\nHmm. So, is he in the wrong? Let's break it down. On one hand, the husband has a valid concern. He's taking on more responsibilities during her absence, and meal prep could ease the stress. He's not asking her to do something unreasonable for the week she's away, right? But why did she get upset? Maybe she feels it's an extra burden she didn't anticipate when planning her trip. Maybe she's already stressed about the trip or other aspects of her work. Also, the husband is asking her to prepare meals for the week she's away, which might not be feasible if she's busy with her own travel prep. \n\nIs it fair to expect her to do that? Well, if she's the one who's going away, maybe she should help prepare for her absence. But she's the one who's normally responsible for cooking. The husband is acknowledging that he can do it, but he's less efficient. So he's trying to make things easier for himself. But he's asking her to do something that might add to her workload right before she leaves. That could be a conflict. \n\nAnother angle: communication. Did they discuss this before the trip was confirmed? Maybe she didn't have time or the capacity to prep. Or maybe she feels that once she's gone, it's his responsibility. The husband's request might be seen as shifting the burden back to her even when she's not there. But he's not asking her to be there; he's asking for prepped meals. \n\nAlso, the response from the wife was that it's too much work, and he's okay with just making sandwiches. But he's worried about the kids' reactions. It's a balancing act between his needs and her capacity. \n\nIn terms of fairness, if she's the one taking the trip, maybe it's reasonable she helps prepare. But if the timing is tight or she's already stressed, maybe it's not. The key is whether the request is reasonable given the circumstances. \n\nThe husband isn't forcing her; he's asking. She's declining, and he's questioning if that's unfair. But maybe she's right in that once she's gone, it's his responsibility. So perhaps he's not in the wrong for asking, but maybe he's not considering her workload. Alternatively, maybe he should have planned ahead more. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the request is reasonable considering her current workload and time. Since the trip is a week away, maybe she can prep, but if it's last minute or she's busy, it's not feasible. The husband's intention is valid, but maybe the execution missed understanding her capacity. However, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. Since he's asking for help and it's a reasonable request given the context, he's probably not in the wrong. So the answer is B.\n"
