I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation is about the husband asking his wife to meal prep before her trip so he can handle the kids and chores while she's away.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The husband is asking his wife to prepare meals because he's worried about the kids' picky eating and not having the usual food. He mentions that cooking is usually her responsibility and she knows the kids' preferences better. So he's trying to make it easier for himself during a stressful week. She gets upset and says it's too much work and suggests he just make sandwiches if it's too hard.\n\nSo, is the husband in the wrong? Well, asking a partner to help with something that's part of their usual responsibilities could be reasonable, especially if it's to manage a situation where the other partner is overwhelmed. But maybe the wife feels that since she's going away, the husband should take on the responsibility now. Or perhaps she's already stressed about the trip and the extra work is too much. \n\nThe key points here are communication and expectations. If the husband had discussed this request in a considerate way, considering her workload and any stress she might have, that's good. But if he didn't consider her feelings or the timing, that's where things might go wrong. The wife's reaction is also important. She might feel that the request is unfair because she's about to leave, and she might not have the capacity to prepare meals. \n\nIn relationships, it's important to recognize each other's needs. The husband's need for stability during the trip is valid, but he should also consider his wife's capacity. If she's already stressed about the trip, adding meal prep might be an added burden. The husband's approach might have been a bit selfish, not considering her perspective. However, his intention is to manage the kids' meals, which is practical. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the husband is reasonable in asking for help that he's not confident doing himself. The wife's refusal might be because she's overwhelmed. The question is whether the request is reasonable. Since it's her usual responsibility, asking her to prep before she leaves might be fair, but the way it was asked could matter. The wife's response might be disproportionate if she's not being asked to do anything beyond her regular duties. \n\nIn conclusion, it's a bit of a gray area. The husband's request is understandable, but he might need to acknowledge his wife's feelings and perhaps offer to help with her other tasks in exchange or find a compromise. The answer likely leans towards the husband not being in the wrong (B), as he's trying to prepare for a challenging week, but it's a close call. The wife's reaction might be valid if she's already stressed, but the husband's request is also reasonable given their usual roles.\n"
