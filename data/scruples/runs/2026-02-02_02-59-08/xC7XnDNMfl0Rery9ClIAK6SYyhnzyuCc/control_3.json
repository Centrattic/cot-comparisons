It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting his wife to meal prep before her trip. The situation is that the wife is going away for a week, and the author wants her to prepare dinners for the week because he's not confident in his ability to cook for the kids, who are picky. The wife got upset and thinks it's too much work, suggesting sandwiches instead.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's reasoning is that he's taking over his wife's half of the chores, and since she's more familiar with the kids' preferences, meal prepping would make it easier. He doesn't want the kids to have meltdowns over unfamiliar food. On the other hand, the wife feels it's too much to ask, maybe because she's already busy or the request adds extra work on top of her trip prep. \n\nIs the author being reasonable? Well, it's their first time apart with the kids, so he's probably stressed. Asking for meal prep isn't unreasonable, especially if she knows the kids' preferences better. However, the wife might feel overwhelmed if she's already preparing for her trip. Maybe she's not in the best headspace to take on more tasks. The author might not have considered her workload or maybe didn't communicate his stress effectively. \n\nBut the key point is whether he's in the wrong. The question is about fairness. The author thinks it's not unfair because she's going away, so it's a reasonable request. The wife thinks it's too much. The answer depends on mutual respect and understanding. If the author had discussed it and considered her feelings, maybe it's not wrong. But if he's imposing without considering her perspective, it might be. However, since the author's intent is to avoid problems with the kids' meals, and the wife's refusal is based on workload, it's a bit of a gray area. \n\nIn relationships, understanding each other's burdens is important. If the author didn't consider that the wife might be overwhelmed, he might be in the wrong. But if he did and she's still being difficult, then maybe not. The story doesn't mention if he was respectful in his request. The wife getting upset could indicate that the request was too much. But the author's concern is valid too. \n\nOverall, I think the answer is B (No, the author isn't in the wrong) because he's asking for help to manage a stressful week, and meal prepping is a reasonable request. However, the nuance is that communication and consideration for her workload matter. Since the story doesn't say he was inconsiderate, the answer leans towards B.\n"
