It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away. AITA?\n\ntl;dr My wife is leaving for a week and refuses to food prep\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author asked his wife to meal prep for a week while she's away, and she got upset. The author's reasoning is that since cooking is her responsibility and the kids are picky, he wants the meals prepped to avoid meltdowns. The wife thinks it's too much work.\n\nHmm. First, I need to consider the dynamics here. The wife is going on a trip, and the author is taking over her usual chores. Cooking is her main responsibility, so he wants her to prepare meals in advance. But she's upset because it's too much work. Is it fair to ask for that during her trip?\n\nWell, she's taking time off, so asking her to do extra work right before she leaves might be a lot. Maybe she's already stressed about the trip or other preparations. Also, the author could have considered other solutions. Like, maybe they could have adjusted the kids' meals temporarily or involved the kids more. Or perhaps they could have frozen meals she usually makes so he can reheat them. \n\nThe author argues that he doesn't want meltdowns over unfamiliar food. But is that a valid reason to make her prep during her trip? It seems like the author is relying on her help even while she's away. Maybe he should take on more responsibility himself, especially since he's aware of the challenges. \n\nAnother angle: communication. Did they discuss this beforehand? If the author waited until she's about to leave to ask, that's a problem. If he had prepared earlier, maybe he could have cooked some meals himself. Also, the wife's response seems dismissive, suggesting sandwiches, which might not be ideal for picky kids. \n\nBut the author's reasoning is that he's overwhelmed and wants to make it easier. Still, asking someone to do work during a time when they're supposed to be getting away might not be fair. The wife might need that trip to recharge, and adding meal prep could add stress. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong for not planning ahead and expecting her to do extra work while she's away. He could have taken more initiative himself or adjusted their routine. The wife's refusal is a valid reaction to the unreasonable request. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
