It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away.

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again.\n\nThe author's wife is going on a week-long trip, her first since having kids. The author is asking her to meal prep for the week because he's worried about cooking for the kids, who are picky. He's not as familiar with their preferences as she is. The wife got upset, saying it's too much work, and suggested he could just make sandwiches if it gets too hard. The author thinks it's reasonable to ask her since she's leaving for a week.\n\nFirst, I should consider both sides. The author is asking for help to manage a week without his wife, which is a valid concern, especially with kids involved. On the other hand, the wife might feel that meal prepping for an entire week is an extra burden, especially if it's already part of her regular responsibilities. Maybe she's already stressed about her trip or the separation and doesn't want to take on more before leaving.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that since the wife is the primary cook and knows the kids' preferences, meal prepping would be easier for him. However, the wife might feel that the request is excessive or that the author isn't being considerate of her workload. It's possible that the author didn't consider her perspective when making the request. If she's already preparing for a trip, adding meal prep could add stress. Maybe the author should have discussed this in a way that acknowledges her effort to help and shows appreciation, rather than making it a demand.\n\nAlso, the wife's response about making sandwiches if it's too hard might indicate that she's trying to be helpful but has her limits. The author might not be considering that she has her own preparations to make for the trip and that meal prepping might not be feasible for her.\n\nAnother angle: the author is asking for something that's part of his wife's usual role. If that role is shared or if the author is expected to take on more when his wife is away, maybe there's an imbalance. However, if the wife is already doing most of the cooking, it's reasonable she knows the kids' preferences better. But expecting her to prep for the week might be unreasonable if it's an extra task on top of her regular responsibilities.\n\nI think the key here is communication. The author might not have approached the request in a way that shows understanding of his wife's situation. If he had offered to help with the meal prep or suggested an alternative, that might have been better received. Instead, the tone might have come off as a demand without considering her feelings or workload.\n\nSo, considering all that, maybe the author is in the wrong because he didn't communicate his needs in a considerate way, not considering his wife's perspective and workload. Alternatively, if the wife is already overburdened, the author's request might be reasonable but the way he presented it could be the issue. But since the question is whether he's in the wrong, the answer hinges on whether the request itself is fair. If the wife is going away, it's reasonable to expect her to help prepare, but if she's already stretched thin, maybe not. However, the author's reasoning is that he's not as capable, so the request is reasonable. But the wife's refusal suggests she feels it's too much. I'm a bit torn. Maybe the answer is A or B?\n\nWait, the user says they think the author is in the wrong. But I need to decide based on the situation. The author is asking for something that's part of his wife's role, but she's the one leaving. If it's reasonable for her to help prepare for the week she's away, maybe he's not wrong. However, if the way he asked was dismissive of her feelings, then he's in the wrong. The problem states that she got really upset, implying the request was made without empathy. So perhaps the author is in the wrong for not considering her feelings. Alternatively, maybe it's reasonable to ask. Hmm.\n\nI think the key point is that the author is asking for something that's part of his wife's usual responsibilities, so it's not inherently wrong. But if the wife has other commitments, maybe the author should have been more flexible. However, since the author is the one who has to manage without her, expecting her to help prepare is understandable. The issue might be the wife's reaction. But the question is about the author's actions. If he's asking for something reasonable, then he's not in the wrong. If the request is unreasonable, then he is. Since meal prepping for a week is a common request when someone is away, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. But the wife's reaction could indicate that the request was made without considering her workload or feelings. Wait, the author mentions that the wife is going away on a trip, so maybe she's already busy preparing for it. If the author didn't consider that, then he might be in the wrong. But if he's justified in expecting her to help since it's part of her usual role, then not. It's a bit of a toss-up, but I think the answer leans towards the author not being in the wrong (B) because the request is reasonable and he's asking for help with something that's part of her responsibilities. However, the way he presented it could have been better. But since the question is about being in the wrong, maybe the answer is B.\n"
