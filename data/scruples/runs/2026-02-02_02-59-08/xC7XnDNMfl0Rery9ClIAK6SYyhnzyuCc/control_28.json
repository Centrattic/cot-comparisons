It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person (the husband) is in the wrong for asking his wife to meal prep before her trip. The situation is that the wife is going away for a week, the husband is worried about handling the kids and chores alone, especially cooking. He asked her to prep meals because he's not as good with the kids' picky eating, but she got upset and refused, suggesting he just make sandwiches if it's too hard.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate both sides. The husband's reasoning is that it's a week he's alone with the kids, and since cooking is the wife's responsibility, and she knows their preferences better, he asked her to prep. But she's taking a trip, so maybe she's already busy with her own preparations. The wife's reaction suggests she feels it's too much to ask, maybe because she's already stressed about the trip or doesn't want to take on extra work before leaving. \n\nIs it reasonable to ask her to prep meals? Well, it's a week-long trip, so maybe she's dealing with her own packing, work, etc. The husband is trying to plan ahead to avoid stress. But if she's already overwhelmed, adding meal prep might be too much. The key here is whether the request is fair. The husband is asking for help that he knows he might need, but the wife feels it's an unfair additional burden.\n\nThe question is about whether the husband is in the wrong. From a fairness perspective, he's trying to manage his responsibilities and ensure the kids are fed properly. However, the wife's refusal might indicate that she feels the request is not considerate of her current workload. The husband might not be in the wrong because he's trying to prepare, but maybe he didn't consider her perspective enough. However, he's also trying to avoid potential meltdowns from the kids, which is a valid concern.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the wife's role in the household includes managing the kids' meals, so it's reasonable to expect her to plan ahead. But if she's already taking a trip, perhaps the husband should take over more responsibilities, even if it's challenging. The answer might depend on their usual household dynamics and communication.\n\nIn terms of AITA (Am I the Asshole) standards, the husband is asking for help in a way that's reasonable, but the wife's reaction might be a bit harsh. However, the husband might not be considering that the wife has her own preparations to handle. So maybe the answer is B (No, he's not in the wrong) because his request is reasonable given his need to manage the kids, but there's room for discussion. Alternatively, if the request was made without considering her workload, maybe A. But the husband's reasoning is that he's not as capable, so he's asking for help. I think B is the answer here because the request is understandable and not unreasonable.\n"
