She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking their wife to meal prep before her trip. The author's wife is going on a week-long trip, which is her first time away from the kids since they were born. The author is handling her half of the chores, including cooking, which the wife usually does. The author asked her to prep dinners for the week because the kids are picky and she knows their preferences better. The wife was upset, saying it's too much work, and suggested the author just make sandwiches instead.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author is trying to prepare for a challenging week, so asking for help seems reasonable. However, the wife is going on a trip, which might be her first time away, and she might be stressed about that. The author is asking her to take on extra work before the trip, which could add to her stress. \n\nThe key points here are: the author's request is to make things easier for them during the week, but the wife might see it as an added burden. The author thinks it's fair since she's leaving for a week. But maybe the wife is already stressed about the trip and doesn't want to spend time prepping meals. \n\nIs it reasonable to ask someone going on a trip to do extra work beforehand? It depends on the circumstances. If the trip is important for her, maybe she expects some help. The author is asking for help that they can manage, but the wife might feel it's unfair given that she's the one traveling. \n\nAlso, the kids being picky is a valid reason, but the author could have offered to help with the meal prep or find another solution. The fact that the author didn't offer to assist might contribute to the wife's frustration. \n\nSo, the author's intention is good, but maybe the request wasn't communicated well. The wife might feel it's an added responsibility when she's already dealing with her own stress. The author might not be in the wrong, but there's a communication issue here. Alternatively, maybe the author is in the wrong for not considering the wife's perspective and the extra stress of the trip.\n\nHmm, I'm a bit torn. The author's request seems reasonable, but the wife's reaction suggests it's a problem. Maybe the author should have been more considerate of her stress. But the author's need to manage the children's meals is also valid. \n\nI think the author isn't entirely in the wrong because they're trying to prepare. However, the way the request was made might have been dismissive of the wife's feelings. The wife's refusal could be valid if the request is too much. So, maybe the author is partially at fault for not considering the wife's perspective and the additional stress of the trip. Alternatively, the wife might be overreacting. \n\nIn the end, the key is mutual understanding. The author's request is practical, but it's important to acknowledge the wife's feelings. The author could have offered help with the prep or found a middle ground. Since the wife declined, the author might need to adjust their approach instead of pressing for the meal prep. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong, but there's room for better communication. Therefore, the answer is B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
