She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The person is asking if they're the a**hole for wanting their wife to meal prep before her trip. Their wife is going on a week-long trip, the first time she's been away from the kids since they were born. The husband is worried about handling all the chores and cooking, since that's usually her responsibility. He asked her to prep dinners for the week, but she got upset and said it's too much work. The husband feels it's fair because she's going away, but the wife disagrees.\n\nHmm. So, the question is whether the husband is in the wrong. I need to consider both sides. The husband has a valid concern. Cooking for kids is hard, especially if they're picky, and the wife knows their preferences better. Meal prepping could save time and reduce stress for him. But the wife is being asked to do extra work before her trip, which she's already on. Maybe she's already stressed about the trip or the workload. She might feel it's an added burden, especially if she's already handling her own travel prep. \n\nThe husband's request is about helping him manage during her absence. But is it reasonable? If the wife is on a trip, she's not there to cook, but prepping meals before leaving would require her to take time out of her schedule right before the trip. Maybe she's already busy with packing, work, etc. The husband might not be considering her perspective. He's asking her to take on extra work (which she might see as her responsibility anyway) as a favor for his convenience. \n\nAlternatively, maybe he's just trying to make things easier for himself, which is understandable. But expecting her to do the prep for him might be seen as shifting responsibility onto her even though she's leaving. The wife might feel like she's being asked to work harder right before her trip, which could be stressful. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Maybe not entirely. He's in a tough spot with the kids and work. But he should have considered her workload and maybe discussed it more sensitively. The wife's reaction might be because she feels it's too much, and maybe the husband didn't communicate his needs clearly or consider her side. \n\nIn some ways, the husband isn't wrong to want help, but maybe the way he asked or the assumption that she should do it without considering her own situation. The answer might depend on their usual division of labor. If cooking is her norm, asking her to prep might be reasonable. But if she's already stressed about the trip, maybe it's too much. \n\nI'm leaning towards the husband not being in the wrong because he's trying to prepare and it's a reasonable request. But I can see the wife's perspective too. However, since the user thinks the author is in the wrong, maybe I should consider that. Maybe the husband didn't realize that the wife might not want to take on more work before her trip. So, maybe he's a bit in the wrong for not considering her feelings and workload. \n\nAlternatively, the answer could be that the husband isn't in the wrong because he's asking for help in a way that's manageable for her (prepping meals once before the trip) rather than expecting her to do it all during. But the wife's refusal might be valid if she's already overwhelmed. \n\nI'm torn. The husband's request is logical, but the wife's reaction might be due to her own stress. Maybe the husband is not in the wrong, but should have approached it more gently. But the answer might be that he's not in the wrong. So, answer B.\n"
