She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the question is in the wrong. The scenario is that the husband wants his wife to meal prep before her trip so he can handle the kids and chores alone. The wife is upset and thinks it's too much, suggesting sandwiches instead.\n\nSo, the main points: The wife is going away for a week, first time since the kids were born. The husband normally handles work and chores, but cooking is her responsibility. He asks her to prep meals because the kids are picky and he's worried about meltdowns if he can't make the same food. She gets upset, says it's too much work, and suggests sandwiches.\n\nThe user is asking if the husband is in the wrong. So, I need to evaluate if asking his wife to prep meals is unreasonable. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the husband's reasoning: He's taking over her half of the chores, including cooking, which he can do but isn't as familiar with the kids' preferences. The wife knows their likes better. He wants to avoid meltdowns. So he's trying to make things easier for himself. But he's asking her to do the prep work before she leaves.\n\nThe wife's response is that it's too much work. She's already going on a trip; maybe she's busy or stressed. She offers an alternative of sandwiches, which might be easier for him. But he's not happy with that solution because he wants the kids to have their usual meals.\n\nNow, considering fairness. Is it unfair to ask her to prep meals? Well, she's the one who's going on the trip and leaving him with all the responsibilities. He's asking her to do something before she leaves to make his week easier. Since she's the one who normally handles cooking, maybe it's reasonable that she preps meals she knows the kids like. But she's saying it's too much. Maybe she's overburdened already. Alternatively, maybe she's not willing to take on extra work before her trip.\n\nAnother angle: Is there a middle ground? Maybe she can prep some meals, or they could compromise. But the husband is asking her to do all the dinners for the week. Maybe that's a lot for her to handle. But he's not wrong in wanting to ensure the kids eat properly. However, if he can make sandwiches, maybe that's a backup. But he's worried about meltdowns if the kids don't get their usual food.\n\nAlso, the fact that this is her first time away from the kids might mean she's already stressed about the trip. Adding meal prep might be an extra burden. But the husband is trying to prepare for his own challenges during her trip.\n\nIs the husband's request unfair? It depends on the circumstances. If the wife is already under stress from the trip and the prep would add to her workload, maybe he's not considering her perspective. On the other hand, if he's taking over her responsibilities, he might need her help in advance to manage.\n\nI think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). Because he's trying to plan ahead for a challenging week and is asking his wife to help by doing what she knows the kids like. It's a reasonable request to make before she leaves. However, there's a need for communication and compromise. But based on the situation, the request itself isn't wrong. The wife might be overreacting, but the husband's intent is to manage the situation better, not to burden her unnecessarily. So, he's not in the wrong.\n"
