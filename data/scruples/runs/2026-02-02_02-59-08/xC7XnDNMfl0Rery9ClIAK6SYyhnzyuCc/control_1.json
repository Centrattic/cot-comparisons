I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation is that the husband asked his wife to meal prep for the week she's away, but she got upset and said it's too much work. He's wondering if he's at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The wife is going on her first trip since the kids were born, so the husband will be handling everything alone. Cooking is her responsibility, and she knows the kids' preferences better. He's asking her to prep meals in advance so he doesn't have to handle it all when she's away.\n\nOn one hand, it makes sense that he wants to make things easier. The kids are picky, and she's more familiar with their tastes. Meal prepping could prevent issues when the husband is managing solo. On the other hand, the wife felt it's too much to ask, especially since she's going on a trip. Maybe she's already stressed about the trip or the time away from the kids, and adding meal prep adds to her burden.\n\nI should think about communication. Did the husband present this as a request or an ultimatum? The wife's reaction suggests she felt it was a burden. If the husband had discussed options or offered flexibility, maybe she would be more cooperative. But he just asked her to prep, and she felt it was too much. \n\nAlso, considering fairness. The wife is going away and might not be around to handle her usual chores, so the husband is stepping in. But asking her to prep before she leaves might be a way to balance the load. However, it's possible that the husband didn't consider her perspective\u2014if she's already busy with packing or other preparations, adding meal prepping might be overwhelming.\n\nAnother angle: the wife's response was to say it's too much and suggest sandwiches. That might indicate she's not willing to help beyond a certain point. But the husband feels that's inadequate because the kids might have meltdowns without their usual meals. So there's a conflict between his need for consistency and her capacity to prepare.\n\nIs the husband in the wrong? If he made a reasonable request considering the circumstances, maybe not. But if he didn't consider her stress or workload before the trip, perhaps he overstepped. The key is whether the request was fair given the situation. Since the wife is going on a trip, asking her to do something before she leaves (like prepping) seems logical. However, if the amount of prep is excessive, that's a problem.\n\nI think the answer is B (he's not in the wrong) because he's trying to manage the household during her absence. The wife could have been more understanding or offered alternative solutions. But maybe there's nuance. If the husband had discussed it more and found a middle ground, that would be better. But based on the information, the husband's request seems reasonable, so he's not in the wrong.\n"
