It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is the wife is going on a week-long trip, first time away from the kids since they were born. The husband is worried about handling the chores, work, and cooking. Since cooking is the wife's responsibility and the kids are picky, he asked her to meal prep for the week. The wife got upset, saying that's too much work, and suggested he could just make sandwiches if it gets hard.\n\nHmm. The author's reasoning is that he doesn't want the kids to have meltdowns over unfamiliar food, and he thinks asking her to prep is fair since she's away the whole week. But the wife is upset. So, is he in the wrong?\n\nFirst, maybe the husband's request is reasonable. He's asking for help to manage a challenging week. Meal prepping could make things easier for him, especially with picky eaters. However, the wife might feel that the request is additional work she didn't anticipate when planning her trip. Maybe she didn't realize the extent of the burden he's taking on. Did they discuss the division of responsibilities beforehand? If they usually split chores, maybe the husband expects her to handle cooking, even when she's away. But she's not there to do the cooking, so prepping before her trip would be a way to help. \n\nBut why did she get upset? Maybe she's already stressed about the trip, or she feels that the request is unfair because she's not at home. Maybe she thinks he should handle it, even if it's harder for him. Or maybe she feels that the request is too much extra work when she's preparing for her own trip. \n\nIs the husband's request unreasonable? He's asking her to do something that would make his life easier during her absence. It's a common practice for people to help each other by prepping meals before a trip. But if she's already overwhelmed with her own preparations, maybe the timing isn't good. Maybe the husband didn't consider her workload or maybe he should have offered to do more of the cooking himself instead of expecting her to prep. \n\nAlso, the wife's suggestion to make sandwiches might be a cop-out. If the kids are picky, sandwiches might not be sufficient. But maybe she's trying to minimize her own effort. \n\nI think the husband's intention is to avoid problems, but he might not have considered his wife's perspective. Maybe he should have discussed it more and found a compromise. However, his request isn't inherently wrong. It's about communication and mutual understanding. \n\nIn terms of fairness, if the wife agreed to the trip knowing that she's responsible for cooking, then asking her to prep could be fair. But if she didn't anticipate that, then maybe the husband should have taken on more responsibility. \n\nSo, is the husband in the wrong? Maybe not entirely. He's trying to manage a difficult week. The issue might be more about how he communicated the request or not considering her workload. But based on the information given, I don't think he's in the wrong. So the answer would be B.\n"
