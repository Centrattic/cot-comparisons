      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for asking their wife to meal prep before her trip. Let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The wife is going on a week-long trip, her first time away from the kids since they were born. The husband is taking over all her chores, including cooking, which the wife usually does. The kids are picky eaters, and the husband is worried he might not handle their preferences as well. So he asks her to prep the dinners for the week. She gets upset, saying it's too much work and offers to make sandwiches if needed. The husband thinks it's not unfair to ask since she's going away for a week.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know my opinion. Now, I need to decide if the answer is A (Yes, he's wrong) or B (No, he's not).\n\nLet me consider both sides. From the husband's perspective, he's preparing for a big responsibility\u2014taking care of the kids alone for the first time. He's working and doing all the chores. The kids are picky, which adds stress. He's asking his wife to meal prep to make things easier. He's not asking her to cook during the trip but to prepare in advance. It seems like a reasonable request to prevent meltdowns from the kids missing their usual meals.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife is going on a trip. She might have other things to prepare for her trip, and meal prepping for a week could be a lot of work. She's already stressed about the trip and the upcoming separation from her kids. She might feel that the husband is not taking her workload into consideration. Her response about sandwiches might be a way to say she's not willing to do the meal prep, even if it's for the kids. That could come off as dismissive of his concerns.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics. In a relationship, it's important to communicate and compromise. The husband is trying to plan ahead to reduce stress for both of them. The wife's reaction is a bit harsh, but maybe she's overwhelmed. However, the husband's request seems practical. Meal prepping isn't unusual, especially for a family situation. But maybe the wife feels it's too much, especially if she's already stressed about her trip. It's a balance between being considerate of each other's workloads.\n\nIs the husband in the wrong? Well, he's making a request that's within his right. He's not forcing her; he's asking. The wife is responsible for her part, but perhaps the husband should have offered to handle the cooking and maybe even offered to help with meal prep if she's overwhelmed. Alternatively, maybe they could have found a middle ground, like prepping some meals together or using simpler recipes. However, the husband's main point is that he's not asking her to cook during the trip, just to prep before. That's a reasonable request, especially since she's the one who's more familiar with the kids' preferences.\n\nThe wife's response of \"if it's too hard, just make sandwiches\" seems dismissive. It might imply she's not taking his concerns seriously, which could be why the husband feels upset. However, she might be expressing that she's already stretched thin. But given that the husband is taking on her usual chores, asking for some help in advance could be seen as fair.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the husband isn't wrong for asking. The wife is in a position to decide whether to help or not. The husband is trying to manage a challenging situation, and meal prepping could prevent issues. So maybe the husband isn't in the wrong. The answer would be B (No).\n"
