It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away. AITA?\n\ntl;dr My wife is leaving for a week and refuses to food prep\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong for asking his wife to meal prep before her trip. The situation is that the wife is going away for a week, and the husband is concerned about handling the kids and chores alone, especially with cooking since the kids are picky. He asked her to prep meals, but she got upset and refused, offering to make sandwiches instead.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband's perspective is that he's overwhelmed and wants to avoid potential meltdowns from the kids if the food isn't right. He's asking for help because his wife knows the kids' preferences better. On the other hand, the wife might feel that the request is an added burden, especially since she's going on a trip. She might be stressed about her own plans and not have the capacity to prep meals. \n\nIs the husband being reasonable? Meal prepping isn't unreasonable, but maybe the timing or the expectation is. It's important to consider their relationship dynamics. If this is a normal part of their routine, maybe the husband should have done it himself more often. However, he mentions that cooking is her responsibility and she's better at it. So his request is based on practicality. \n\nBut why did she get upset? Maybe she feels he's not contributing enough around the house, or she's already stressed about the trip. The key here is communication. If the husband had discussed this earlier or if they had a system in place for such situations, maybe her reaction would be different. \n\nIs asking her to prep meals unfair? It could depend on their usual arrangements. If she's taking a break and the husband is taking over, maybe he should step up more instead of expecting her to do extra work before leaving. Alternatively, maybe she's not in the right place to do it now. \n\nThe husband's argument is that he's trying to avoid problems. But if she's already refusing, insisting might not be helpful. He should consider alternative solutions, like involving the kids in simple meals or using leftovers. \n\nIn terms of fairness, it's a gray area. The husband isn't wrong for wanting help, but he might be missing the fact that his wife has her own stressors. The real issue might be about balancing support and understanding each other's needs. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If he's expecting her to do something that's adding to her pre-trip stress, maybe he's not considering her perspective. But if he's genuinely overwhelmed and she's refusing without compromise, then maybe it's a mutual issue. The answer might lean towards A (he's in the wrong) because he's not considering her stress and is making her feel guilty for not helping. Or B (not in the wrong) because he's trying to manage his responsibilities. \n\nI think the key is whether the request is reasonable. Meal prepping isn't wrong, but maybe the way it's framed is. If he's asking for a week's worth of dinners, that's a lot. Maybe the wife felt it was too much. The husband could have offered to help with prep, but he didn't mention that. So, his approach might be part of the problem. Therefore, he's partially at fault for not being more considerate of her workload.\n"
