It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away. AITA?\n\ntl;dr My wife is leaving for a week and refuses to food prep\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting his wife to meal prep before her trip. The situation is that the wife is going away for a week, and the husband is handling her chores, including cooking. The kids are picky eaters, and the husband feels he can't manage without her prepping meals. She got upset and suggested he just make sandwiches instead.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the arguments from both sides. The husband's reasoning is that since he's not used to cooking and the kids have specific preferences, meal prepping would help him avoid meltdowns. He's asking for help, which is reasonable. On the other hand, the wife is taking a well-deserved break, and maybe she finds the request burdensome. She might feel that she's already giving up her time, and adding meal prep is extra work she didn't anticipate.\n\nBut let's think about fairness. The husband is taking on a significant responsibility (chores and cooking) during her absence. Since she's the one who usually handles cooking and knows the kids' preferences better, asking her to preplan meals could be seen as a practical solution. It's not an unreasonable request if it helps him manage without her. However, it's also possible that she's overwhelmed with the trip itself or feels that the request is imposing on her last day before leaving.\n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual support. The husband expressed his needs, which is valid. The wife's reaction might be due to stress about the trip or feeling overburdened. However, the husband isn't making her do anything during the trip itself; he's asking her to prepare before she leaves. That seems fair because she's not there to do it during the trip. It's more about setting him up for success while she's away.\n\nOn the flip side, if the meal prep is too much work for the wife, maybe there's a middle ground. Maybe she can prep a few meals instead of all. But the question is whether the husband is in the wrong for making the request. Since he's being proactive and considering the kids' needs, I don't think he's wrong. It's a reasonable ask given the circumstances. The wife's refusal might stem from her own stress, but that doesn't make the husband's request unjust.\n"
