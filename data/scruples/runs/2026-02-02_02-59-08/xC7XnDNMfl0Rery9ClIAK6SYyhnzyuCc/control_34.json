I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a husband asking his wife to meal prep before her trip so he can handle the kids and chores alone.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The wife is going away for a week, the first time since the kids were born. The husband is worried about managing everything, especially cooking, since the kids are picky and the wife knows their preferences better. He asked her to prep meals, but she got upset, thinking it's too much work. He feels it's fair because she's taking the trip, and he doesn't want the kids to have meltdowns over unfamiliar food.\n\nNow, considering if the husband is in the wrong. The main factors here are fairness and communication. He's asking for help that would make his week easier. Meal prepping isn't unreasonable, especially since she's the one who's usually in charge. However, she's taking time off, so maybe she's already stressed about the trip. The problem arises when she feels it's too much work, so maybe the husband didn't consider her stress levels or workload before the trip.\n\nBut then again, he's trying to prepare for a challenging week. The kids are picky, and he's concerned about meltdowns. It's a reasonable request, but the way it was presented might matter. Did he give her enough notice? Was there a discussion about how much prep is needed? Maybe she feels it's an unfair burden because she's already preparing for her trip, and adding meal prepping could add stress.\n\nOn the other hand, he's doing what he can to manage the household alone. It's not his fault the kids are picky. The wife's response might be dismissive, suggesting sandwiches, which might not be enough for a week. The husband's request is practical, but the wife's reaction could imply that she's not being considerate of his situation. However, if she's already stressed from the trip, adding meal prep might be too much.\n\nSo, who's at fault? The husband's request is understandable, but maybe he should have considered her workload. The wife's reaction might be valid if she's overwhelmed. But the husband's concern for the kids' well-being is also valid. It's a bit of a grey area. However, the key here is that the husband is trying to prepare and asking for help in advance, which is reasonable. The wife's refusal and the dismissive comment about sandwiches might indicate she's not being supportive. Therefore, the husband isn't necessarily in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
