It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the husband asked his wife to meal prep for the week she's away on a trip. His reasoning is that he's not as experienced with the kids' food preferences and he's worried about handling everything on his own. The wife got upset and refused, saying it's too much work, and suggested he just make sandwiches if needed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband's argument is that he's taking on a lot more responsibility during her absence, including chores and cooking, which he's not used to. He wants to avoid issues with the kids over unfamiliar food. The wife, on the other hand, might feel that the request is unreasonable, especially if she's already stressed about the trip or if the prep work is too much on top of her existing responsibilities.\n\nI should think about what's fair in a partnership. It's common for couples to divide chores, but when one person is leaving, it's natural for the other to want some support. However, the wife might feel that the husband should be able to manage on his own, or that meal prepping isn't something he should ask her to do when she's about to go away. Maybe she's already packed and preparing for her trip and feels this is an added burden. \n\nAlso, the husband's request is reasonable given the circumstances. He's not asking her to do something for herself, but to help him manage during her absence. However, the wife's reaction suggests that she might feel unappreciated or that the request is unfair. Maybe there's a communication issue here. Perhaps the husband didn't consider her workload before the trip, or she feels he's not stepping up enough. \n\nAnother angle: The husband is asking for help that he's not comfortable doing himself. That's a valid concern because he's worried about the kids' reactions. But maybe the wife feels that he should be capable of handling it, or that he should adjust his expectations. \n\nI need to determine if the husband's request is unreasonable. Meal prepping for a week is a lot, but if the wife is going away, perhaps she has the time to do it before leaving. However, if she's already busy, maybe it's too much. The key here is whether the husband is making a fair ask given that she's taking time off. Since he's asking her to do something to make his transition easier, it's a request that's in her capacity (she's the one who usually cooks and knows the kids' preferences). \n\nBut maybe the wife is right in feeling that it's too much. If she's already preparing for her trip, adding meal prep might be overwhelming. Also, the husband might need to take responsibility and learn to cook for the kids, even if it's challenging. However, considering the kids are picky, it's understandable that he wants consistency. \n\nIn terms of fairness, it's a bit of a toss-up. The husband isn't wrong for wanting support, but the wife isn't wrong for feeling overwhelmed. The real issue might be communication. The husband could have discussed it earlier or offered to help with her trip prep in exchange. The wife's response might be a bit dismissive, but her feelings about the workload are valid. \n\nSo, is the husband in the wrong? Probably not entirely. He's asking for practical help to manage a challenging week. The wife's reaction is valid but maybe she could have been more understanding. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because his request is reasonable, but there's room for compromise. Alternatively, if the wife's feelings are more important here, maybe A. But I think the husband's position is more about practicality, so B.\n"
