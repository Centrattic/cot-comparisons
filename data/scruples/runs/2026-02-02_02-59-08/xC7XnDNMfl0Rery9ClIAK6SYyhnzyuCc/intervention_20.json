She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking his wife to meal prep before her trip. The situation is that the wife is going on a week-long trip, and the husband wants her to prep dinners because the kids are picky and he's not used to cooking. The wife got upset and said it's too much work, suggesting sandwiches instead.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The wife is going away for the first time since the kids were born. The husband is taking over her chores, including cooking, which he's not as comfortable with. He's asking her to prep meals to ease the transition. But she's resistant, possibly because prepping for a week is a lot of work.\n\nThe author argues it's fair to ask since she's the one going away. The wife's response suggests she feels overburdened. Maybe there's a communication issue. Did the husband consider her workload before the trip? If she's already preparing for travel, adding meal prep might be too much. On the other hand, the husband is trying to prevent potential stress during the week he's managing alone.\n\nI should think about expectations in relationships. Partners often share responsibilities, but when one is going away, maybe the other expects some preparation. However, the wife might have her own reasons for not wanting to prep, like time constraints or stress. The husband's request is reasonable, but maybe he didn't consider her perspective enough. Is it fair to ask her to prep if it's causing her distress? Alternatively, maybe he should have offered to help with the prep instead of just asking her to do it.\n\nThe key points are: the husband's need for stability, the wife's resistance, and whether the request is reasonable given the circumstances. It's possible he's not in the wrong because he's trying to manage his new responsibilities. However, if the prep is too demanding for her, maybe he should have found another solution. But since the kids are picky and she knows their preferences better, his reasoning makes sense. The wife's suggestion of sandwiches might not meet the kids' needs, so his concern about meltdowns is valid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the husband should have discussed this earlier or offered to help with prep instead of making it her sole responsibility. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. If the request is within reason and he's trying to make life manageable, then he's not wrong. However, if he's adding a last-minute task that she didn't agree to, it could be seen as unfair. The answer might hinge on communication and mutual understanding. Since the wife got upset, perhaps the husband didn't consider her workload. But the wife could also have said no earlier if she thought it was too much. I'm leaning towards the husband not being in the wrong because his request is practical, but maybe there's room for improvement in their communication.\n"
