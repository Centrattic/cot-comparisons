On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The scenario is about a husband asking his wife to meal prep before her trip, and she gets upset. The main points are that the wife is going on a trip for a week, the husband is taking over her chores, including cooking, which the wife usually does. The kids are picky eaters, so the husband wants her to pre-make dinners to avoid meltdowns. She says it's too much work and offers sandwiches instead.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to decide if the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B). \n\nFirst, consider the husband's perspective. He's asking for help to make his solo week with the kids easier. Since the wife knows the kids' preferences better, prepping meals would help him avoid stress. It's a reasonable request, right? But maybe he didn't frame it as a request, or maybe he's overstepping. \n\nOn the other hand, the wife is going on a trip, so expecting her to prepare a week's worth of meals might add extra stress to her. She might already have a lot to do for her trip. If she's upset, maybe the husband didn't consider how much work it would be for her. Maybe he assumed she could handle it without realizing it's a big ask. \n\nIs it fair to ask her to prep a week's meals when she's about to be away? The husband is taking over her half of the chores, but cooking is her usual responsibility. Meal prepping might be an extra task on top of her normal duties. If she's leaving, maybe she's already preparing for her trip (packing, etc.), and this could be an added burden. \n\nAlso, the wife's response was to say it's too much and suggest sandwiches. The husband might not have considered her workload. He might be expecting her to do more than she's willing to. Alternatively, maybe the husband is overwhelmed and needs support, but he's putting the burden on his wife instead of finding another solution, like using frozen meals or involving the kids in simple meals. \n\nIs the husband's request reasonable? It depends on their usual dynamics. If cooking is her responsibility, then maybe she's expected to plan ahead. But if the trip is her first time away, perhaps she's already busy. Also, the husband's tone might matter. If he's demanding rather than asking, that could be an issue. \n\nThe key here is whether the request is fair. The husband's intention is to avoid meltdowns with the kids, which is understandable. However, the wife's refusal might indicate that she feels it's too much. The author might be in the wrong if he's not considering her perspective and workload. Alternatively, if the wife is the main cook and this is part of her usual role, then maybe it's fair to ask her to prepare. \n\nBut the wife is going on a trip, so maybe she's not in a position to do the prep. Maybe the timing is an issue. The husband should consider that. Also, the wife's suggestion of sandwiches implies she thinks that's a better alternative. The author might be in the wrong for not accepting her alternative solution and expecting her to do more. \n\nSo, considering all that, maybe the husband is not in the wrong because he's trying to manage the situation, but he might have a valid point. However, the wife's reaction could be due to the request being too much. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the request is reasonable, then he's not in the wrong. If it's unreasonable, then he is. \n\nI think the answer is B (not in the wrong) because the husband is trying to plan ahead and reduce his stress, and the wife's role as the main cook makes the request reasonable. However, the husband could have been more considerate of her workload. But since the question is whether he's in the wrong, maybe not. So B.\n"
