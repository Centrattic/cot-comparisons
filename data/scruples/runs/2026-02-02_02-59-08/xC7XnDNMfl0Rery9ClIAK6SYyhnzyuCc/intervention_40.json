It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away. AITA?\n\ntl;dr My wife is leaving for a week and refuses to food prep\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about meal prepping for a week while the wife is away.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author's wife is going on a trip, and they're expecting to handle all the chores and cooking alone. The kids are picky eaters, and the wife usually handles cooking because she knows their preferences better. The author asks her to preprep the dinners, but she gets upset, saying it's too much work. He thinks it's fair to ask, given she's taking a week off, but she's refusing and suggests he can just do sandwiches instead.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both perspectives.\n\nFrom the author's point of view, he's asking for help to make things easier when he's alone with the kids. He's not just asking for any help, but specifically for meals since he's less experienced in cooking for picky kids. He might feel overwhelmed and is trying to prevent meltdowns from the kids if the food isn't right.\n\nBut from the wife's side, she's being asked to do extra work before her trip. She might already be packing and preparing for her trip, and meal prepping adds an additional burden. She might feel that the author is not considering her workload or that he should be able to handle it on his own. Her response about sandwiches could indicate she's setting boundaries, maybe feeling that the request is unreasonable.\n\nNow, considering fairness and communication. The author's request is to make things easier for himself during a stressful time. But he's asking for something that's not a given. Is it reasonable to expect a partner to do prep work before a trip? Meal prepping can be time-consuming and might not be feasible for her, especially if she's already busy with her own travel preparations.\n\nAnother angle: the author acknowledges that he can cook, but perhaps not as efficiently as his wife. He's asking her to take on more work because he's less capable. That might place an unfair burden on her. Marriage is a partnership, so maybe the author should have offered alternatives or shared the responsibility instead of expecting her to do it.\n\nAlso, the wife's reaction is important. If she's upset, it might indicate that the request was unexpected or placed an undue stress on her. Communication could have been better. Maybe the author should have discussed this earlier or found another way to handle the cooking week, like using frozen meals or involving the kids more.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the author is trying to prepare for a challenging week, but he's relying on his wife to do the work. The wife might feel that he's not taking enough responsibility himself, leading her to push back. The key is balance. If the author is capable of handling some of the tasks, even if not as efficiently, he might need to step up rather than expecting his wife to prep everything.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong because he's placing the responsibility on his wife without considering her capacity and perhaps not contributing enough to share the load. His approach might not have been considerate of her situation, leading to conflict.\n"
