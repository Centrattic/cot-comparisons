It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for asking their wife to meal prep before her trip. So, the main points here are that the wife is going away for a week, which is her first time away from the kids since they were born. The husband is worried about handling the chores and cooking, especially since the kids are picky and the wife usually handles that. He asked her to prep meals for the week, but she got upset, saying that's too much work and offered to just make sandwiches if it gets hard.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the husband's perspective. He's taking on a significant responsibility for the first time by himself, and he's concerned about the kids' reactions if the meals aren't as they're used to. His request seems to be about managing the workload and stress during her absence. The wife is taking a break, so it's reasonable that the husband wants to prepare in advance to make things easier.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife might feel that the request is adding extra work before her trip, which could be a valid concern. People going on trips might already be stressed about packing, so asking for meal prep could add to that. However, the husband is trying to plan ahead to avoid problems during her absence. The wife's response of \"just make sandwiches\" might be dismissive, but it's possible she's underestimating the importance of the kids' meal preferences.\n\nThe key here is whether the husband's request is reasonable. Since the wife is the one who normally cooks and knows the kids' preferences, asking her to prep meals for the week before her trip seems logical. It's a proactive step to ensure things run smoothly. The wife's reaction might stem from feeling overburdened, but the husband's request isn't unreasonable given the circumstances. The husband isn't asking for something excessive; he's asking for help to manage a challenging period. Therefore, the husband isn't in the wrong here. The answer is B.\n"
