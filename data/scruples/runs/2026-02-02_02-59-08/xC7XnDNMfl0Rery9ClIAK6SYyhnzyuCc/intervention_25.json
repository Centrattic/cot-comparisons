It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away. AITA?\n\ntl;dr My wife is leaving for a week and refuses to food prep\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting his wife to meal prep before her trip. The situation: the wife is going away for a week, and the husband is asking her to prepare meals so he can handle the kids and chores alone. The wife got upset, saying it's too much work, and suggested he just make sandwiches.\n\nFirst, the husband's reasoning is that cooking is his wife's responsibility, and she knows the kids' preferences better. He wants to avoid meltdowns from different meals. The wife, however, feels it's too much to ask, especially since she's about to leave. \n\nI need to consider both perspectives. The husband is trying to manage the household alone for the first time, which is a valid concern. He's asking for help to make things easier. But the wife might be overwhelmed with the trip itself and the additional request. Maybe she's already preparing for her trip, and meal prepping adds stress. She might feel it's unfair to ask her to do extra work right before leaving.\n\nIs it reasonable to ask someone to prepare meals before a trip? It depends on the circumstances. If the wife is happy to help, it's fine. But she's objecting, so maybe the husband should have considered the timing. He might not realize how much work it is for her or that she's already stressed about the trip. Alternatively, the wife could have offered to do a smaller amount or suggested alternatives.\n\nThe husband's main point is that he needs the meals to avoid meltdowns. But he's also acknowledging he can manage, just not as well. The wife's response was dismissive, suggesting sandwiches, which might not address his concerns. There's a communication gap here. The husband's request might be reasonable, but the way he approached it could be the issue. Or maybe the wife's refusal is valid because the timing is bad.\n\nI think both sides have points. The husband isn't in the wrong for wanting help, but maybe he didn't consider her perspective. The wife is in the wrong for being dismissive, but her objection is valid. However, the question is about the author (husband) being in the wrong. If the husband's request is reasonable, then he isn't in the wrong. But if the request is unreasonable given the wife is about to leave, then he might be. It's a judgment call. I'm leaning towards B (no) because he's trying to manage the situation, but maybe A if the request is too much. But I'm not sure. Maybe the husband didn't consider her workload before the trip. So maybe A. Hmm.\n"
