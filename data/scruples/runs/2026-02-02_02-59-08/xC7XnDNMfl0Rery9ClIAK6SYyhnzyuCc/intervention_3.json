      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author's wife is going on a week-long trip, their first time away from the kids since they were born. The author is worried about handling the kids and chores alone, especially since cooking is usually the wife's responsibility. The kids are picky, and the author isn't as familiar with their preferences. He asked her to prep the dinners for the week, but she got upset and said it's too much work, suggesting he can just make sandwiches if it's too hard.\n\nHmm. The author's reasoning is that he doesn't want the kids to have meltdowns over unfamiliar food. He thinks it's fair to ask her to prep since she's going away. But the wife is resistant. So, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for making that request.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is asking for help to manage a situation he's not used to handling. He's taking on a lot more responsibility during her absence. On the other hand, the wife is being asked to do extra work before her trip. Maybe she's already stressed about the trip or has other preparations. Also, meal prepping for a week might be time-consuming and physically demanding, especially if she's not used to doing it that far in advance. \n\nIs there a middle ground? Maybe the author could have asked for something less than full meals, like prepping ingredients or sharing the cooking responsibilities instead of expecting her to handle all the dinner prep. Or perhaps the author could have taken some time to learn the kids' preferences better, maybe with the wife's help before she leaves. \n\nBut the key here is whether the request is unreasonable. The author is relying on the wife's expertise because of her familiarity with the kids' preferences. However, the wife's refusal might be valid if prepping for a week is too much for her, especially if she's already busy with her trip preparations. Maybe she didn't realize the author's concerns, or maybe she feels it's not fair that she has to do all the prep work when she's not even there to see the benefits. \n\nAlso, the author's tone in the request might be an issue. If he framed it as a favor for him rather than a collaborative effort, that could come off as demanding. Alternatively, if he had discussed it earlier or offered to help with the prep, maybe she would feel more supported. \n\nIn terms of fairness, it's a shared responsibility in a marriage. The author is asking for help in a specific area where the wife is more experienced. However, expecting her to take on extra work before her trip without considering her workload might be selfish. The wife's response about making sandwiches suggests she's aware of the possible issues but doesn't want to take on the task. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It depends on the context. If the wife has the capacity to preplan and is capable but refuses without a valid reason, maybe not. But if the request is adding unnecessary stress to her and she's unable to handle it, then the author might be overstepping. Since the author didn't mention discussing this with her in a supportive way or offering to help, it could be seen as putting the burden solely on her. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author's approach might be seen as not considering his wife's perspective. He might be in the wrong if he's not acknowledging her workload or not collaborating. Alternatively, he's trying to solve a problem by leveraging his wife's strengths. \n\nI think the answer isn't clear-cut, but given the information, the author might be in the wrong because he's not considering his wife's perspective and the additional work he's asking her to do. The wife's refusal could be valid if the request is too much. So, maybe A (author is in the wrong). But I'm not entirely sure. Another angle is that he's trying to be practical. So, maybe it's a B (not in the wrong). Hmm.\n"
