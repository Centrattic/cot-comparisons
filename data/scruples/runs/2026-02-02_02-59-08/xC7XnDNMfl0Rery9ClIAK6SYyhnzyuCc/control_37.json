      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this question. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong for asking his wife to meal prep before her trip.\n\nFirst, let's break down the situation. The wife is going on a week-long trip, her first time away from the kids since they were born. The author will be handling everything alone, including work and all the chores. Cooking is normally the wife's responsibility, and she knows the kids' preferences better. The author asked her to prep meals for the week so it's easier for him. The wife got upset, saying that's too much work, and suggested sandwiches if it's too hard.\n\nSo, the author wants the meal prep to avoid issues with the kids' picky eating. He thinks it's reasonable because she's the one who knows their preferences and it's her half of the chores. The wife feels it's too much to ask.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about expectations and fairness. The author is asking for help that would make his week easier, but the wife is feeling overwhelmed. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for making this request.\n\nI should consider both sides. The author isn't necessarily wrong for wanting support; after all, it's a big change. But maybe he didn't consider her feelings or workload before the trip. The wife might be stressed about her trip and the added task of meal prepping, which could be time-consuming. Maybe she's not in the headspace to take on extra work right before leaving. The author's request is practical, but the wife's reaction suggests she feels it's an unfair additional burden.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is trying to prepare to manage without her, which is understandable. He's not asking her to do something during the trip, just before she leaves. But if the wife is already preparing for her trip, maybe meal prepping adds too much. It's possible that the author didn't realize how much the meal prep would add to her workload, or he didn't communicate his request in a supportive way.\n\nSo, the author might not be in the wrong because his intention is to make things easier for himself and the kids. However, the way he approached the request might have been insensitive. The wife's reaction might be due to feeling that the request is unreasonable, especially if she's already busy. The author could have offered to help with the meal prep or considered other solutions, like freezing meals or adjusting the kids' meals for the week. Since the wife is taking the week off, maybe the author should have taken responsibility for figuring out the meals without expecting her to pre-make them. \n\nAlternatively, since cooking is her usual responsibility, asking her to plan the meals might be fair. But considering that it's a week-long prep, maybe it's a lot. The author might need to find a middle ground, like prepping some meals himself or adjusting the menu. The key here is whether the request was reasonable given the circumstances. The wife's refusal might indicate that the author didn't account for her personal stress or workload. \n\nIn the end, the author might not be in the wrong for seeking support, but perhaps he could have handled the situation better. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Since the wife is the one who refused and got upset, maybe the author isn't wrong. But some might argue that expecting her to prep meals adds to her pre-trip workload, which is unfair. But since she's the one who normally does the cooking, the author's request is about delegating her usual responsibility. It's a bit of a toss-up. I think the answer might lean towards B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because he's trying to prepare and the wife is the one who's upset. But others might say A if they think the request is too much. However, given the setup, the author's reasoning is practical, so B.\n"
