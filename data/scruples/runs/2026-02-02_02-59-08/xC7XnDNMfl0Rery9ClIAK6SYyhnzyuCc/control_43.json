She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person is in the wrong for asking their wife to meal prep before her trip. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The wife is going away for a week, the first time since the kids were born. The husband wants her to prep dinners because he's not as confident in cooking for the picky kids. He's worried about meltdowns if the kids don't get their usual food. The wife gets upset, saying it's too much work and offers to just have sandwiches if needed.\n\nSo, the question is whether the husband is in the wrong. From the husband's perspective, he's trying to avoid stress and ensure the kids eat properly. He's taking on extra chores and work. From the wife's side, she might feel that the request is adding unnecessary pressure on her, especially since she's going away and might be busy or tired. Meal prepping for a week could be time-consuming and maybe she's not in a position to do that, either emotionally or practically.\n\nI need to consider if the husband's request is reasonable. Cooking is her responsibility, and he's acknowledging she's better at it. But asking her to prep a week's worth of meals before a trip might be a lot. Maybe she's concerned about the time, the effort, or that it's not fair since she's not there to benefit from it. Also, the wife's reaction is strong, which might indicate that the request is coming from a place of stress but perhaps not considering her perspective.\n\nAnother angle: Is there an alternative? The husband could take the time to learn the kids' preferences or maybe get help, but he wants to avoid meltdowns. However, the wife's suggestion of sandwiches is a compromise. Maybe the husband's request is reasonable, but the way he asked could have been more considerate. Or maybe the wife is overreacting because she's stressed about the trip itself.\n\nIn relationships, communication matters. If the husband had a conversation about the challenges and asked for her input, she might be more willing. But he did ask, and she said it's too much. So, if the wife is the one who declined, then the husband isn't the one in the wrong. But maybe he's not considering her feelings or workload. It's a balance between his needs and hers.\n\nSo, the answer might be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong) because he's trying to manage the situation based on his needs, but maybe there's room for more consideration. However, the wife's refusal is valid as well. The key is whether the request is unfair. Since he's asking her to do something before her trip, and it's a one-time thing, maybe it's not unreasonable. But if it's too much for her, he should respect that. But the question is about whether he's in the wrong. Since he's asking for help and the wife is the one who declined, the answer might be B.\n"
