It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking his wife to meal prep before her trip. Let me break this down.\n\nThe author's wife is going on a week-long trip, her first time away from the kids. The man is concerned about handling the chores and cooking alone, especially since the kids are picky and his wife usually handles cooking. He asked her to prep meals for the week, but she got upset, saying it's too much work. He thinks it's fair because she's leaving for a week. \n\nHmm. So the key points here are: the wife is going away, the husband wants her to meal prep to ease his burden. The wife feels it's too much work and is upset. The husband is wondering if he's at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics. The husband is taking over her responsibilities, which is a big deal. Meal prep could indeed be a big task. The wife might feel that her trip is a chance to rest, and the request is adding more stress. Also, the husband is aware that his wife knows the kids' preferences better, so he's trying to avoid meltdowns. \n\nIs the husband's request unreasonable? Maybe. Meal prepping for a week, especially for picky kids, could be time-consuming. The wife might have other things to handle before her trip. The husband is asking her to do work right before she leaves, which could be overwhelming. \n\nOn the other hand, the husband is genuinely trying to manage his own stress by prepping meals. He's not asking her to cook while she's away, which is reasonable. But the timing and the amount of work might be the issue here. The wife's reaction suggests that she's already stressed about the trip or the request is adding to her stress.\n\nAnother angle: communication. Did the husband consider the wife's workload? Maybe they didn't discuss alternatives. For example, maybe the husband could adjust the meals or involve the kids in some way. The wife's offer of sandwiches is a compromise, but the husband seems to prefer the usual meals to prevent meltdowns.\n\nSo, is the husband in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. If he's asking her to do something that's unreasonable for the time before her trip, then maybe he is. But if he's just trying to prepare and she's resistant, it's a matter of balancing both their needs. The wife's feelings being hurt indicate that the request might be imposing too much. The husband might not have considered her perspective enough.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the husband is trying to make things easier for himself, but at the cost of his wife's stress before her trip. It's a mutual adjustment situation. Since the wife is upset, the husband's approach might not be considerate enough. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not considering her feelings and the workload right before her trip.\n"
