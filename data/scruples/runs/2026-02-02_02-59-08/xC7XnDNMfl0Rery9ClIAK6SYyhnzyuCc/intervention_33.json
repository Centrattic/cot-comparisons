It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away.

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for asking his wife to meal prep before her trip. \n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The husband is asking his wife to prepare meals for their kids during her week-long trip. He mentions that cooking is her responsibility, the kids are picky, and he's worried about handling everything alone. She's upset because she thinks it's too much work and offers to just let him make sandwiches.\n\nSo, the key points here are about shared responsibilities and expectations. The husband feels it's reasonable to ask her to prep meals given the circumstances. The wife feels it's an added burden. \n\nI should consider if the husband's request is unfair. Meal prepping for a week can be time-consuming, especially if she's already packing for her trip. Is it typical for one partner to handle all meal prep? Maybe they have a division of chores where she does most of the cooking. But now, with her away, he's taking over, and he's worried about not meeting the kids' preferences.\n\nBut is it fair to ask her to prep meals when she's preparing to leave? She might be busy with her own tasks. The husband's intention is to avoid stress, but he's adding to her workload before her trip. Maybe he should have offered to take over some of her other duties instead of just asking for meal prep. Alternatively, could they have split the meal prep or agreed on something else?\n\nThe wife's response that she can't do it and suggests sandwiches might be dismissive. However, her being upset could indicate she feels overwhelmed. The husband might not have considered that she has her own pre-trip stressors.\n\nSo, is the husband wrong? It depends on their usual arrangement. If cooking is her responsibility, asking her to prep before leaving might be reasonable, but if she's already stressed about the trip, it could be too much. The husband didn't consider her perspective, maybe. He assumed he couldn't handle it and didn't explore other solutions.\n\nAnother angle: communication. He asked, she replied, and he's now questioning if he's wrong. Maybe he should have discussed this earlier, not waiting until she's about to leave. Also, the wife's suggestion to make sandwiches might be a low-effort solution, but maybe that's what he needs. However, he's concerned about the kids' reactions to different food.\n\nIn relationships, it's about mutual understanding. The husband's request isn't inherently unfair, but he didn't consider her workload. The wife's reaction might be valid if she feels it's too much. So, perhaps the husband is partially in the wrong for not considering her perspective and not finding a compromise. Alternatively, it's a reasonable request, and the wife should have been more accommodating.\n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the request was reasonable given the circumstances. Since the wife is going on a trip, it's understandable to want to reduce her workload, but prepping meals for a week is a big ask. The husband might be in the right if he's trying to manage his responsibilities, but maybe he's in the wrong if he's not considering her stress. The key is balance. \n\nGiven that the user initially thought the author is in the wrong, but others might see it as reasonable. The answer could be A (yes) or B (no). But I need to decide based on the context. Since the wife is the one who usually cooks and the husband is taking over, asking her to prep before leaving could be seen as fair because she's not there to cook. However, if she's already busy with her trip, maybe it's not fair. The husband's reasoning is about avoiding meltdowns, which is valid, but the wife's refusal is also valid. Perhaps the husband is not in the wrong because he's trying to manage the situation, but the wife's perspective is valid too. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since he's asking for help and it's her usual role, maybe he's not. Alternatively, he could have found another solution. Hmm. Maybe the answer is B (no), but I'm not entirely sure. Let me check again. The husband is asking for prepping, which is her responsibility. The wife is upset because it's too much work. The husband's reasoning is valid, but maybe he should have considered other options. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. If the answer is B, then he's not. If A, then he is. I think the key is that asking her to prep is a reasonable request given her usual role, so he's not in the wrong. So answer B.\n"
