It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away. AITA?\n\ntl;dr My wife is leaving for a week and refuses to food prep\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is at fault for wanting his wife to meal prep before her trip. The situation is that the wife is going away for a week, and the husband will be handling all the chores and cooking alone for the first time. The kids are picky eaters, and since the wife usually handles cooking, he wants her to prep meals for the week. She got upset, saying that's too much work and suggested he just make sandwiches if it gets hard.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband's perspective is that he's asking for help because he's overwhelmed. He's taking on additional responsibilities temporarily and wants to avoid stress with the kids. The wife's reaction is that she feels the request is too much. Maybe she's already stressed about the trip or feels it's unfair given she's the one leaving. \n\nIs the husband's request reasonable? He's asking for meal prep for a week, which can be time-consuming. However, since she's the one cooking more often and knows the kids' preferences better, maybe it's logical for her to prep. But the wife might feel that since she's going away, she shouldn't have to take on extra work before the trip. Also, maybe she's already preparing for the trip and feels this is an added burden. \n\nThe husband is trying to plan ahead to reduce his stress, which is understandable. However, the wife's reaction might indicate that she feels the request is unrealistic or that he should handle it himself. It's possible he's not considering her perspective\u2014maybe she's already busy with her own preparations and doesn't have the time or energy. \n\nThe key points: Is the husband's request fair? It depends on the circumstances. If the wife is willing and able, it might be reasonable. But if she's already overwhelmed, maybe he should find another solution. The husband might not be in the wrong for asking, but perhaps he didn't communicate his needs clearly or consider her workload. Alternatively, the wife's refusal could be valid if she's not able to help further. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the husband is taking on her duties temporarily, so asking her to prepare meals could be seen as a way to ease the transition. However, it's important to balance both partners' workloads. The wife might feel that since she's not present, she shouldn't have to contribute further. The husband might be overestimating the necessity of her prepping versus trying to manage his own stress. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the request is realistic given the wife's current situation. If she's already preparing for her trip, adding meal prep might be too much. The husband's intention is good, but he might not have considered her capacity. So maybe he's not in the wrong, but the situation requires better communication. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Since he's trying to plan, but the wife's refusal is valid due to her own workload, the answer might be B (No), but there's nuance. Alternatively, maybe the husband is in the right because he's trying to manage the situation best he can. But the wife's response is also valid. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), the author is not in the wrong. He's trying to prepare, and the wife's refusal is her prerogative, but he's not wrong for asking. It's a matter of differing priorities and expectations, but neither is necessarily at fault.\n"
