It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away. AITA?\n\ntl;dr My wife is leaving for a week and refuses to food prep\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for asking his wife to meal prep before her trip. The situation is that the wife is going away for a week, and the author is concerned about handling the kids and chores alone. He asked her to prep dinners because he's not as comfortable cooking for the picky kids as she is. She got upset and said it's too much work, suggesting sandwiches instead. The author feels it's a reasonable request since she's taking a week off.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's reasoning is that he's taking on a lot by managing the house and kids alone, and meal prepping would help. He's not asking her to do it during her trip, just before she leaves. The wife's perspective is that meal prepping is too much work and maybe she's already stressed about the trip or the separation. She offers an alternative, which is sandwiches, implying she thinks that's more manageable.\n\nIs the author being unreasonable? Well, he's acknowledging that he can do it but prefers her to prep because she's better at it. That shows he's trying to make things easier for himself. However, he's asking her to do work before her trip, which might be a time when she's preparing for her own plans. Maybe she has other things to handle, so the request could be adding stress. But the author is also considering the kids' needs, which is valid. \n\nBut is he in the wrong? The key points are: he's asking for help to manage his own stress, and she's saying it's too much. The fact that she suggested sandwiches shows she's trying to help but has limits. The author might not be in the wrong if he's not forcing her, but he might need to communicate better or find a compromise. However, the question is whether he's at fault. If he's making a reasonable request that's reasonable to ask, and she's the one declining, then maybe he's not wrong. But if he's overstepping by expecting her to do work before her trip, especially if she's already busy, then maybe he is. \n\nBut the wife is going on a trip, which is a time when she might be preparing for her own needs. If the author is asking her to prep meals for the week, that's a bit of a significant task. However, since she normally does the cooking, it's logical for him to ask her to help set things up. So maybe it's a reasonable request. The wife's reaction might be more about the workload or stress, but the author's intention is to make things easier. \n\nI think the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong. He's trying to manage his responsibilities and the kids' needs, and he's not forcing her to do anything. He's asking for help, which is reasonable. The wife is under no obligation to do it, but the author isn't wrong for making the request.\n"
