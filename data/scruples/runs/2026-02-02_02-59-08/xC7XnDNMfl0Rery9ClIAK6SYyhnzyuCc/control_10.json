It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away. AITA?\n\ntl;dr My wife is leaving for a week and refuses to food prep\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author asking their wife to meal prep before her trip, which she refused and got upset.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics here. The wife is going away for her first trip since the kids were born. The author is taking over all her chores, including cooking, which he's not as experienced with. He asked her to prep meals because he's worried about the kids' picky eating and potential meltdowns. The wife feels it's too much extra work, maybe not considering his perspective. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, he's asking for help in a situation where he's already taking on a lot. Meal prepping could make his week easier, especially since he's less familiar with the kids' preferences. The wife's reaction seems a bit dismissive, suggesting he can just make sandwiches. But why is that a problem? Maybe she's overwhelmed with her own trip preparations or doesn't see the difficulty in cooking for picky kids. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might be overstepping by expecting her to do extra work when she's already going to be away. But considering it's her trip, maybe it's fair to ask for some help to ease the transition. The key points are communication and mutual understanding. Did the author present his case calmly? It seems he tried to explain his reasons, so he's not being unreasonable. The wife, however, didn't acknowledge his stress and instead minimized his concerns. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong here. He's seeking practical help for a challenging time. The wife's refusal without considering the situation might be the issue. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
