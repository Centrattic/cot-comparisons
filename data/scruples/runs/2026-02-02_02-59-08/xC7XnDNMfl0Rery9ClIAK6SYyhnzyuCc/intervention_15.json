It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away. AITA?\n\ntl;dr My wife is leaving for a week and refuses to food prep\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the husband) is at fault for asking his wife to meal prep before her trip. He's a bit overwhelmed because it's his first time handling everything alone with the kids while working. Cooking is usually the wife's job, and the kids are picky, so he wants her to prep meals to avoid issues.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The wife is going on her first trip since the kids were born, which is a significant change. The husband is asking her to take on extra work before her trip, which might add stress. The wife reacts negatively, finding it too much work, and suggests sandwiches as an alternative. The core issue is whether the request is reasonable.\n\nFrom the husband's perspective, he's trying to manage a new situation with kids and work, and he's relying on his wife's expertise in cooking. He might feel it's a fair request since she's the one leaving and she's more familiar with the kids' preferences. However, the wife might see this as adding to her stress before her trip, especially if she's already packing and preparing for her journey. Maybe she's overwhelmed with her own travel plans and doesn't have the bandwidth to prep meals.\n\nIs the husband in the wrong? Well, he's expressing a need for help, which isn't inherently wrong. But if he's not considering her feelings or her own stress, that could be problematic. The key here is communication and mutual support. The wife feeling upset might indicate that the request was made without considering her current situation. Maybe the husband didn't check in with her about her capacity to take on more work. Alternatively, the wife might need to be more flexible and understanding of his concerns.\n\nIn relationships, sharing responsibilities and supporting each other is important. If the husband's request is reasonable and the wife is being inflexible, maybe the wife is at fault. But if the husband didn't consider her workload or stress, then he might be in the wrong. The answer isn't straightforward. However, since the wife got upset and the husband didn't seem to offer alternatives or consider her perspective, maybe he's overstepping by expecting her to do more before her trip. It's a balance between being proactive and respecting each other's limits.\n\nI think the husband's intent is good, but the way he made the request might have been insensitive. The wife's reaction could stem from feeling that her own needs aren't being considered. So, the husband isn't entirely wrong, but he could have handled it better. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Since the wife is the one who is upset and the request might be adding to her stress, the husband's approach might be problematic. Therefore, the answer is A, he is in the wrong.\n"
