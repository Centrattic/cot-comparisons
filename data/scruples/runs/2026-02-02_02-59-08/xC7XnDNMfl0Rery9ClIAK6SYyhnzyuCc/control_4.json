She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong for asking his wife to meal prep before her trip.\n\nSo, the situation: The wife is going on a week-long trip, her first time away from the kids since they were born. The husband will be handling all the chores alone, including cooking, which is usually the wife's responsibility. The kids are picky eaters, and the wife knows their preferences better. The husband asks her to prep dinners for the week so he doesn't have to deal with it, but she gets upset, saying it's too much work. He thinks he's not in the wrong because she's taking a week off, so he's asking her to do something before she leaves.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the expectations in a relationship. It's common for couples to divide chores, and here, cooking is the wife's usual role. The husband is asking her to do something that would make his week easier, but she's resistant because it's a lot of work. \n\nIs it fair to ask her to prep meals? On one hand, he's trying to manage his workload and ensure the kids eat well since they're picky. On the other hand, she's already taking time off, and meal prepping might add extra stress before her trip. \n\nMaybe there's a communication issue here. Perhaps he didn't consider her workload or how much time meal prepping would take. Or maybe she feels it's unfair because she's already leaving and shouldn't have to work extra. Alternatively, maybe the husband didn't offer to help with other chores in exchange or compromise. \n\nThe wife's reaction might indicate that she feels overwhelmed. If the husband had offered to take on more tasks in exchange for her prepping, it might be different. But since he's asking her to do something that's her usual responsibility, but now during her time away, it could be seen as expecting her to work before her trip. \n\nHowever, the husband's intention is valid\u2014he wants to handle things smoothly without meltdowns. Maybe he could have asked in a way that acknowledges her effort, or maybe they could have found a middle ground, like prepping a few meals instead of all. \n\nBut is he in the wrong? If he's asking her to do something that's part of her usual role, and she's not opposed to doing it normally, but now she's taking time off, maybe he's not being considerate of her need to prepare for her trip. So maybe he is a bit in the wrong because he's adding more work before her leave. Alternatively, it's reasonable to ask for help if it's part of her role, especially to prevent problems. \n\nI think it's a bit of a gray area, but leaning towards the husband not being in the wrong because he's trying to manage his responsibilities. However, the way he asked her might have been a problem. But the question is whether he's in the wrong for wanting her to do it. Since she's the one who usually does it, maybe it's fair to ask her to do it before she leaves. So maybe answer B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
