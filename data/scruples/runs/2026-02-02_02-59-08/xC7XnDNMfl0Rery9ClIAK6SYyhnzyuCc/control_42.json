It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting their wife to meal prep before her trip. So, the author's wife is going away for a week, their first time apart since having kids. The author is worried about handling the chores and cooking, especially since the kids are picky and the wife knows their preferences better. The author asked her to prep meals, but she got upset and said it's too much work. He thinks it's fair to ask since she's taking the trip.\n\nHmm. First, I need to consider the context. The wife is going away for the first time since the kids were born, so the author is stepping up to handle everything alone. Cooking is her responsibility, and the author finds it challenging because the kids are picky. He's asking for help to avoid meltdowns. But she's upset because she feels it's too much work. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, he's trying to prepare to make the week manageable. He's not asking for something unreasonable; he just wants prepped meals to make his job easier. The wife is the one who's supposed to cook, and since she knows the kids better, maybe she's in the best position to prep. However, she's upset that he's asking her to do extra work before her trip. But isn't it fair to ask someone who's more capable to help out in their absence? The trip is hers, so maybe she should have anticipated this need and planned accordingly. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the wife feels overwhelmed with her own trip preparations and doesn't have the bandwidth to prep meals. But the author is in a tough situation with the kids and work. The key here is whether the request is fair. Since she's responsible for cooking, asking her to prep meals before the trip seems reasonable. She's the expert in what the kids like, so relying on her knowledge makes sense. The author isn't making her do it during the trip; he's asking before she leaves. So, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. The wife might be overreacting because she's stressed about her trip, but the author has a valid need. So, answer B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
