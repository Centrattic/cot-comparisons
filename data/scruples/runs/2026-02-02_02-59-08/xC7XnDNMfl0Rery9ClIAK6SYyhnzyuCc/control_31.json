It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that the author asked his wife to meal prep for the week she's away on a trip. He's worried about handling the kids and chores alone, especially since cooking is her responsibility and the kids are picky. The wife got upset, thinking it's too much to ask her to prep food in advance.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's reasoning is that he's taking on her half of the chores, including cooking, which he's not as comfortable with because the kids are picky. He wants to avoid meltdowns from the kids not getting their preferred meals. So he's asking her to help out by prepping meals before she leaves. On the other hand, the wife feels that it's too much work for her, given she's going on a trip. She's probably dealing with her own pre-trip tasks and might feel that the request is adding extra stress or workload before her departure.\n\nThe key points here are communication and understanding. The author's request is based on his need for support, which is reasonable. However, the wife's reaction suggests that she might feel overwhelmed or unappreciated. Maybe the way he asked her could have been more considerate. He might not have considered her perspective\u2014she's leaving for a week, so maybe she's already stressed about the trip. Also, he assumes she's the only one who can handle the kids' meal preferences, but perhaps there's a middle ground where he can adjust or they can find another solution together.\n\nBut is he in the wrong? Well, he's asking for help, which is understandable. However, he should've considered her feelings and maybe discussed the request more thoughtfully. Maybe he didn't realize the burden it adds to her. Alternatively, he's trying to plan ahead to make sure things run smoothly during her absence. The wife's response seems a bit dismissive, but her refusal is also valid if she feels it's too much. The author's request might be reasonable, but the way he framed it could have been better. He could have offered alternatives or shown more empathy towards her situation. So while his request isn't entirely wrong, the approach might have been. Therefore, he's not in the wrong, but there's room for better communication. The answer would be B (No) because the author isn't wrong in wanting help, but needs to adjust his approach.\n"
