On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong for asking their wife to meal prep before her trip. The situation is that the wife is going away for a week, the first time since the kids were born, so the husband will have to handle everything alone. Cooking is the wife's usual responsibility, and the kids are picky. The husband asked her to prep dinners for the week, but she got upset, saying it's too much work. He thinks it's fair to ask since she's going away.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband's perspective: he's taking on a lot of extra responsibilities (all the chores, cooking for picky kids) during her absence. He's asking her to prep meals to make it easier, which makes sense because he's not as experienced with the kids' preferences. He's worried about meltdowns if the kids don't get their usual food.\n\nThe wife's reaction: she's upset and thinks it's too much work. Maybe she's already stressed about the trip and doesn't want to take on extra prep work. Or maybe she feels the request is unreasonable given that she's going away and might not have the time or energy. She suggests sandwiches as an alternative, which is a compromise, but he's not satisfied because he wants the kids to have their usual meals.\n\nIs the husband wrong for asking? Well, he's in a tough spot. He's trying to manage a lot, and meal prepping could help. But he should also consider her feelings. Maybe he didn't communicate his request clearly or didn't realize the burden it would add to her. Alternatively, maybe she's being unreasonable because she's not taking into account his need for support. \n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual understanding. If the husband had discussed his concerns and how meal prepping would alleviate his stress, maybe she would have been more willing. But he did ask, and she refused. It's possible that he's not in the wrong because he's asking for help in a reasonable way. However, if his request was a bit much (like expecting her to do all the prep without considering her own workload), then maybe he is. But since this is her first time away, maybe she's already stressed, and adding meal prep is too much. \n\nAnother angle: maybe the husband should have offered to help with the prep or suggested a compromise. But he didn't, so maybe he's not considering her perspective. However, the wife's response of suggesting sandwiches might be dismissive of his real needs. \n\nIn terms of fairness, if she's going away, it's reasonable to expect her to help in a way that makes the transition easier. But if the prep is too time-consuming or stressful for her, maybe it's not the best approach. The husband's intention is valid, but the execution might be lacking. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Probably not. He's trying to manage a challenging situation and is asking for practical help. The wife's reaction might be excessive, but that doesn't necessarily make him right. However, the question is whether he is in the wrong. Since he's asking for help and isn't being unreasonable, the answer is B. He's not in the wrong. The wife's refusal could be due to her own stress or lack of understanding, but the husband's request is a reasonable one given the circumstances.\n"
