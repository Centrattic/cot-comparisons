She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong for wanting his wife to meal prep before her trip. The situation is that the wife is going away for a week, and the author wants her to prep meals because he's not confident he can handle the kids' picky eating. The wife got upset, saying it's too much work, and suggested he just make sandwiches instead.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the dynamics here. The wife is going on her first trip away from the kids, and the author is concerned about managing alone. Cooking is her responsibility, but he can do it, though maybe not as well with the kids' preferences. He asked her to prep meals for the week, which she found too much. She's taking a week off, so maybe she's already feeling the burden of the trip and doesn't want to add prep work.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, wanting support is normal. He's asking for help to manage the workload. But he's also acknowledging that the wife is the one who's been handling meals, so he's aware of her role. However, she's not willing to do the prep, possibly because she's already stressed about the trip or feels it's unfair given she's going away. \n\nOn one hand, the author's request is reasonable; he's trying to prepare so he can handle the week. On the other hand, the wife might feel that since she's going on a trip, she shouldn't have to do extra work. Maybe the author is assuming she can do it without considering her current workload or stress. The wife might be overextended, and the author's request isn't considering her perspective. Alternatively, maybe the author is just trying to get support but communicated it in a way that put her on the spot.\n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual understanding. The author's intention is to make things easier for himself, but he might not have considered his wife's feelings or her capacity. Since she's already going on a trip, adding meal prep might not be fair. The author should have discussed this beforehand, maybe compromising or finding another solution. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. \n\nIn many cases, asking a partner for help is okay, but if it's an unreasonable expectation given their circumstances, it might not be. The wife is going away, so maybe she's already planning to manage her own tasks during the trip. The author's request could be seen as expecting her to work even when she's away. However, if the trip is for leisure or self-care, maybe she's right to not want to add more work. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that the kids are picky, and he's less experienced. That's valid, but he's also responsible for taking over. So, he's in a bind. But the wife's refusal could be because she doesn't want to be responsible for his tasks when she's not there. Maybe the author should have hired help or adjusted the kids' meals. \n\nIn terms of fairness, expecting someone to do prep work before a trip might be reasonable if both parties agree, but if she's already taken the trip, asking for more might not be. The author's request could be seen as not respecting her need for a break. So, maybe the author is not entirely in the wrong, but he might have overstepped by not considering her perspective. However, the answer depends on whether the request was a reasonable expectation given the situation. \n\nAlternatively, since the wife is going away, she's not present to handle the meals, so asking her to prep in advance is logical. But if she's already stressed about the trip, adding prep work might be too much. The author should have considered her stress and maybe found an alternative solution. So, maybe the author is partly in the wrong for not being more flexible. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because his request is reasonable, but I'm not sure. Different people might have different views here. \n\nI think the key is whether the request was fair given her circumstances. If she's on a trip, expecting her to prep for a week before might be a lot, but if she's staying nearby or has time to prep before leaving, it's possible. The author's justification is valid, but the wife's refusal might stem from feeling it's too much. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong, but he could have communicated better. The answer is likely B.\n"
