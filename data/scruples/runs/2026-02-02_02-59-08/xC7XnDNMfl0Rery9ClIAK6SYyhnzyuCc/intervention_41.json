It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away. AITA?\n\ntl;dr My wife is leaving for a week and refuses to food prep\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for asking his wife to meal prep before her trip. The situation is that the wife is going away for a week, and the husband is worried about handling cooking for the kids, who are picky. He asked her to prep meals, but she got upset and said it's too much work. He's trying to avoid meltdowns if the kids don't get their usual food.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband's reasoning is that since cooking is his wife's responsibility and she knows the kids' preferences better, asking her to prep meals would make his week easier. The wife, on the other hand, feels that it's too much to ask, especially since she's preparing for her trip. Maybe she's already stressed about the trip or has her own tasks to manage.\n\nIs it fair to ask her to do meal prep when she's leaving? Well, the husband is taking over her half of the chores, so adding meal prep might be an extra burden. But he's also in a situation where he's handling more responsibilities. The wife could see it as an additional task on top of her trip preparations. Maybe there's a communication issue here. He might not have considered her workload when she's packing, or she might feel that he's not sharing the load enough.\n\nAlso, the wife's response of suggesting sandwiches seems dismissive. If she's not willing to help, maybe the husband should find another solution. But the author's intent is to avoid the kids being upset. However, expecting her to prep meals might be unrealistic if it's too much for her. The key here is whether the request was reasonable given the circumstances. Since it's her first time away from the kids, maybe she's already managing a lot, and adding meal prep is too much. Alternatively, the husband might not have considered her stress levels.\n\nIn terms of fairness, asking for help is understandable, but if the wife feels it's too much, then the husband might need to adjust his expectations. The answer might depend on their usual dynamics. If the wife usually does the cooking and the husband is now stepping in, maybe the request for prep is reasonable. But if she's already overwhelmed with her trip, it's not fair. The husband could have explored other options first, like freezing meals or involving the kids more.\n\nSo, I think the author is not entirely in the wrong, but maybe there's a middle ground. However, since the wife is taking a trip, it's possible that the husband's request is adding to her stress, making it unfair. Therefore, the answer might be A (author is in the wrong) because he's imposing an extra task without considering her situation. But I'm a bit conflicted. Let me check again.\n"
