It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this AITA post is in the wrong for asking his wife to meal prep before her trip. The situation is that the wife is going away for a week, and the husband wants her to prepare meals because he's worried about handling the kids' picky eating habits alone. The wife got upset and said it's too much work, suggesting sandwiches instead.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband's reasoning is that since the wife usually handles cooking and knows the kids' preferences better, prepping meals would make his solo week easier. He's concerned about potential meltdowns if the kids don't get their usual food. The wife feels it's too much to ask, maybe because she's already preparing for her trip and doesn't have the bandwidth. \n\nIs it reasonable to ask for meal prep before a trip? Well, meal prepping can take time, and if the wife is already busy with her own travel preparations, adding that might be a stretch. But on the other hand, the husband is taking on a significant new responsibility (handling all chores and cooking for a week) and is seeking support. \n\nCommunication seems key here. Did the husband ask in a considerate way? If he framed it as a request to reduce her own stress during the trip (since she would be away and not dealing with the kids' mealtime issues), that might be different. But if he's imposing it without considering her workload, that could be the issue. \n\nAlso, the wife's response suggests she feels it's an unfair additional burden. Maybe the husband didn't consider that she might be stressed about the trip already. Alternatively, if the husband isn't willing to step up and learn the kids' preferences, expecting her to prep could be seen as avoiding responsibility. \n\nAnother angle: The wife could be offered a choice. Maybe she's okay with prepping some meals but not all, or maybe the husband could take on some tasks to show he's willing to contribute. The husband's insistence might come off as not trusting his own ability to handle things, which could be frustrating for the wife. \n\nSo, is the husband in the wrong? If he's asking without considering her workload, maybe yes. But if he's genuinely trying to manage the situation and the wife is being unreasonable, then no. It's a bit of a toss-up, but in AITA scenarios, the expectation is often that couples should communicate and compromise. If the husband didn't consider her perspective, he might be at fault. However, if the wife is being overly resistant to helping, she might share the blame. But in this case, the wife's response was to get upset and suggest sandwiches, which is a dismissive solution. \n\nHmm. I'm leaning towards the author being not in the wrong because he's trying to prepare and it's a reasonable request given the circumstances. But maybe there's a lack of consideration for her situation. Alternatively, the wife's refusal might be valid if she's already overwhelmed. It's tricky. \n\nWait, the user says they think the author is in the wrong. But I need to decide based on the scenario. The key points: It's their first time apart since the kids were born, husband is asking for help. The wife is going away, so maybe she's already busy. If the husband is expecting her to prep, but she's already dealing with her own trip logistics, that's a fair point. So maybe the author is in the wrong for not considering her workload. Alternatively, the wife could have said she's too busy and offered another solution. \n\nAnother thought: The husband could have offered to help with her trip preparations in exchange, or taken on some tasks himself. If he just expects her to do the meal prep without considering her end, that's a problem. \n\nSo, maybe the author is in the wrong (A) because he's not considering her workload and is placing an extra task on her during her trip prep. The wife's frustration is valid. The husband could have approached it differently, like asking if she can do some prep without being overwhelmed, rather than expecting her to do all the meals. So answer A.\n"
