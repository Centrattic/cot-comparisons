She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to.

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for asking their wife to meal prep before her trip. Let me think through this.\n\nFirst, the situation: The wife is going away for a week, the first time since the kids were born. The husband is concerned about handling all the chores and cooking, especially since the kids are picky and the wife knows their preferences better. He asked her to prep meals for the week, but she got upset, saying it's too much work and suggested he just make sandwiches if it gets hard. The husband feels it's not unfair to ask since she's taking the trip.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about fairness, expectations, and communication. The husband is trying to manage his workload and ensure the kids are fed properly. He's not asking for something unreasonable, just meal prep for the week. But the wife is stressed about the prep work, which might add to her stress before leaving. \n\nOn one hand, it's reasonable for the husband to want to plan ahead, especially since they have picky eaters. It's a time-sensitive task, and having prepped meals would ease his burden. On the other hand, asking someone to prepare a week's worth of meals might be a lot, especially if it's an added task beyond her usual responsibilities. \n\nThe wife's reaction might indicate that she's already overwhelmed with her own trip preparations. Maybe she didn't expect this extra request, or she's worried about the time and effort required. The husband's request could be seen as a way to share the load, but the wife might feel it's imposing more on her before she leaves.\n\nCommunication seems like a big factor here. Did the husband consider her workload and stress levels before making the request? If he had discussed it earlier or considered alternatives, maybe she would be more receptive. However, the husband's intent is to make things easier for himself, which is understandable. He's not asking for something that's her responsibility to be transferred; he's asking for help in a specific area where she's more experienced.\n\nI think the husband isn't in the wrong because he's trying to manage his responsibilities and has a valid reason. But the wife's stress is also valid. The answer would depend on whether the request was reasonable in the context. Since the husband is covering her chores, asking her to help with prep for the week might be a fair exchange. But maybe the way he asked or the timing of the request could be improved. However, based on the information given, there's no indication of overstepping. So the answer is B (No).\n"
