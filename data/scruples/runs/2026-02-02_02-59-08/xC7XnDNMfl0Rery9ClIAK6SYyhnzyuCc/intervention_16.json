It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away. AITA?\n\ntl;dr My wife is leaving for a week and refuses to food prep\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for asking his wife to meal prep before her trip. The wife is going away for a week, and the husband is worried about handling the kids and chores alone. He asked her to prep dinner for the week because he's not as confident in his cooking skills, especially with picky kids. The wife got upset, saying it's too much work and offered to make sandwiches instead.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband's perspective is that he's overwhelmed and wants to make things easier, so asking for meal prep is reasonable. He's taking on more responsibilities without her, so he needs support. On the other hand, the wife is taking a break, maybe for the first time since the kids were born. She might feel that the request is adding extra work before her trip, which she might see as unfair or unnecessary. Her offer to do sandwiches is a compromise, but the husband is unsatisfied.\n\nIs the husband in the wrong? Well, asking for help isn't inherently wrong, but the context matters. The wife is going on a trip, which could be a well-deserved break. The husband is asking her to take on a significant task before she leaves. If she's already stressed or has other things to do, adding meal prep could be burdensome. The husband might not be considering her workload or emotional state. He's prioritizing his own stress over her need to have a stress-free trip. \n\nBut he's also trying to manage the household without her. The kids are picky, so relying on her knowledge might be practical. However, he could have approached it differently. Maybe he could have offered to help with the prep or suggested a different solution rather than expecting her to do it all. His request might come across as taking advantage of her skills without considering her capacity or willingness.\n\nThe wife's reaction shows she feels it's too much work. If the husband had communicated his needs earlier or involved her in planning alternatives, maybe there could have been a better solution. But as it stands, he's expecting her to do something she's not comfortable with right before a trip. That could strain their relationship. \n\nIn terms of fairness, it's about mutual support. The husband is asking for help, but the wife is also entitled to her space. The key is whether the request is reasonable. Meal prepping for a week is a big ask, especially if she's already preparing for her trip. The husband might not realize the effort required or that she's already planning to be away. \n\nSo, considering all that, the husband's request might be seen as inconsiderate. He didn't account for her perspective and the potential stress it adds to her before her trip. Therefore, he might be in the wrong. But it's a nuanced situation where both sides have valid points. However, the main issue is the husband's assumption that she should do the prep without considering her feelings. So, the answer is A.\n"
