She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to.

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting his wife to meal prep before her trip. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The wife is going on a week-long trip for the first time since having kids. The husband is asking her to prep meals so he can handle the kids and chores alone. She gets upset and refuses, saying it's too much work. He argues that it's reasonable because she knows the kids' preferences better.\n\nSo, the main points are about fairness and expectations. The husband is asking for help to manage the week without her. Cooking is her usual responsibility, and he's asking her to do the prep work before she leaves. He's worried about the kids' meltdowns if the food isn't right. She feels it's too much to ask, and he feels it's a fair request given the circumstances.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics. It's their first time apart since the kids were born, so the husband is taking on a lot. The wife might be feeling overwhelmed by the request, perhaps because she's preparing for her trip already, or maybe she feels her domestic duties are being shifted onto her before leaving. On the other hand, the husband is trying to set himself up for managing the week, which is understandable.\n\nIs the husband in the wrong? Well, he's asking for help that's within her usual responsibilities. It's a practical request to make the week easier. But maybe he's assuming she can or should do it without considering her workload or willingness. However, the wife's response seems a bit dismissive, suggesting she's not willing to help even if it's hard. The husband's reasoning is valid because he's trying to prevent problems at home.\n\nBut in terms of fairness, if they've always split chores and he's now asking her to do something she's responsible for, it's not inherently wrong. The wife might feel that since she's leaving, she shouldn't have to do more work, but the husband is asking her to prepare before she goes. So it's a bit of a gray area. However, since the husband is trying to manage his own stress and the kids' needs, his request is reasonable. The wife's reaction is a bit of a problem, but the husband isn't necessarily at fault here. He's asking for assistance in a way that's logical given their circumstances. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
