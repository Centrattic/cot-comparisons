      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about the husband asking his wife to prep meals before her trip so he can handle the kids and chores by himself.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The wife is going away for a week, the first time since the kids were born. The husband usually does some chores, but cooking is the wife's responsibility. The kids are picky, and the wife knows their preferences better. The husband asked her to prep dinners for the week, but she got upset, thinking it's too much work. He argues it's reasonable since she's going away, and he doesn't want the kids to have meltdowns over unfamiliar food.\n\nThe user wants to know if the husband is in the wrong (A) or not (B). \n\nNow, analyzing from both perspectives. The husband's reasoning is practical: he's taking over her duties, and meal prepping would help with picky eaters. He's not expecting her to do all the cooking during her trip, just to prepare in advance. On the other hand, the wife might feel that being away already is enough, and being asked to prep meals adds extra work before her trip. Maybe she's stressed about the trip itself or feels the request is unfair given she's not present to benefit from the prepped meals.\n\nBut the husband is asking her to help him manage the household during her absence. Since she's responsible for cooking normally, and she knows the kids' preferences, it's a logical request to prevent problems. The wife's response of offering sandwiches might be a solution, but the husband is concerned about the kids' reactions to that. \n\nI need to consider common expectations in relationships. It's typical for partners to help each other prepare for absences. If the wife is going away, she might be expected to make accommodations to ease the burden on the other partner. However, maybe the husband didn't communicate well or underestimated her workload. But the key here is that he's not asking her to stay home; he's asking her to do something before her trip to support him. \n\nThe wife's upset reaction might stem from feeling resentful about the added work, but if she's the one who's taking the trip, it's reasonable for her to assist in setting things up. So, the husband isn't in the wrong for making a reasonable request. The wife's refusal might be based on her own feelings, but the husband's request isn't unreasonable.\n"
