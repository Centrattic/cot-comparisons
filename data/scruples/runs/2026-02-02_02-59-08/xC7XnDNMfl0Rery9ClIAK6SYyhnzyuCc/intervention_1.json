It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away. AITA?\n\ntl;dr My wife is leaving for a week and refuses to food prep\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting his wife to meal prep before her trip. The situation is that his wife is going away for a week, and he's concerned about handling everything alone, especially cooking for the kids who are picky. He asked her to prep meals, but she got upset and said it's too much work.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's reasoning is that he's taking on her half of the chores and wants the kids' meals to be consistent. Since she knows their preferences better, he thinks meal prepping would help. On the other hand, the wife is taking a trip for the first time since the kids were born, maybe she's already stressed about being away. She might feel that meal prepping adds extra work on top of her trip preparations. \n\nThe author might not be considering her perspective here. Maybe she's worried about the time or stress involved in prepping meals. He's asking her to take on more work just as she's preparing for her trip. It's possible he's not acknowledging her feelings about being away from the kids too. \n\nAlso, the wife's response suggests she feels it's an unfair additional burden. The author's argument is that he's doing it for the kids, but if she's already overwhelmed, this could be a point of contention. It's about balancing responsibilities and mutual understanding. The key might be communication\u2014did he consider her workload and feelings before making the request? Maybe the author didn't validate her feelings enough when she expressed being upset.\n\nIn terms of fairness, it's a gray area. The author has valid concerns about managing the household alone, but the wife might feel that her trip is a time to rest, not take on more tasks. The question is whether the request is reasonable. The answer might hinge on whether the author approached her with empathy and considered her stress levels. If he's not willing to adjust or find another solution (like different types of meals), then he might be in the wrong. However, if he's genuinely trying to manage the workload, maybe not. But since she got upset and he didn't validate her feelings, the author could be at fault for not considering her perspective. So, the answer is A for yes, he's in the wrong.\n"
