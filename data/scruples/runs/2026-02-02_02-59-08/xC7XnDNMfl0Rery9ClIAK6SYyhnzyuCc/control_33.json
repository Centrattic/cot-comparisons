It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the wife is going on a week-long trip, and the husband is asking her to meal prep during the week she's away. The reason he's asking is that cooking is her responsibility, and the kids are picky. He wants to avoid meltdowns from them not getting their usual food. The wife is upset, saying it's too much work and offers to make sandwiches instead.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband's perspective is that he's taking over all her chores, including cooking, which he's not as comfortable with, especially since the kids are picky. He's asking her to prepping meals so he doesn't have to deal with that stress. The wife is going away for a week, which is her choice, so maybe she should have considered this before. But she's also being asked to do extra work right before her trip, which might be tiring or time-consuming. \n\nIs it reasonable to expect her to prep meals? Well, since she's the primary cook and knows the kids' preferences better, maybe it's logical for her to handle the prep. But if the trip is her time off, is it fair to add this task? On the other hand, he's taking over her responsibilities, so perhaps she's helping out by meal prepping. \n\nThe wife's reaction is that it's too much work. Maybe she's already busy with packing or other preparations. If she's going away, she might not have the time or energy to prep meals. But the husband is relying on her to make it easier for him. \n\nI think it's about mutual expectations. The husband might not be wrong in asking, given the circumstances. However, the wife's refusal could be because she feels overburdened. It's possible that the husband didn't consider her perspective adequately. But given that she's the one who usually cooks, and the kids are picky, maybe he's justified in asking. \n\nAnother angle: if she's going away, maybe she should have planned ahead. Meal prepping before a trip could be part of her preparation. If she didn't consider that, then the husband isn't wrong. But if she's genuinely overwhelmed, maybe the husband should offer an alternative, like hiring help or adjusting the meal plan. \n\nOverall, it's a bit of a gray area, but I think the husband's request is reasonable. He's trying to manage the household during her absence, and meal prepping would help. The wife's refusal might stem from not having enough time or being overworked herself. However, the husband didn't seem to consider her workload before making the request. But given the context, he's not necessarily in the wrong. So, I'll go with B, No.\n"
