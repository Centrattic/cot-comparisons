It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away. AITA?\n\ntl;dr My wife is leaving for a week and refuses to food prep\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting their wife to meal prep before her trip. The situation is that the wife is going away for a week, and the husband is concerned about managing the kids and chores, especially cooking since he's not as experienced. He asked her to prep the meals, but she got upset and said it's too much work, suggesting he can make sandwiches instead.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband's perspective is that he's worried about handling everything alone, especially the kids' picky eating. The wife might feel that being asked to prep a week's worth of meals is an extra burden, especially since she's going on a trip. Maybe she's already stressed about the trip or feels it's unfair to add more work before leaving.\n\nThe husband's request seems reasonable because he's trying to manage the household alone. However, the wife's reaction might stem from feeling overwhelmed. If meal prepping isn't something she usually does, asking her to do it now, especially for a week, could be a lot. Also, maybe she's tired and doesn't want to take on extra tasks before her trip, which is supposed to be a break.\n\nThe key points here are communication and expectations. The husband might not realize that the prep work is too much for her. Alternatively, the wife might not be considering his stress about handling the kids alone. The question is whether the husband was wrong to ask. From a fairness standpoint, sharing responsibilities is important, but the request's reasonableness depends on the situation. Since the husband is taking over her usual duties, asking her to prep could be a way to split the responsibility, but it's possible he didn't consider her workload or feelings about the request.\n\nSo, the answer might be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong) because he's trying to prepare for the situation. However, there's also a case that he could have communicated better or found a middle ground. But given the information, the main issue is that the wife refused, and the husband's request was to make things easier. It's not clear he's in the wrong. The answer is B.\n"
