She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting their wife to meal prep before her trip. The situation is that the wife is going on a week-long trip, the first time away from the kids since they were born. The husband is concerned about handling the kids and chores alone, especially since cooking is usually the wife's responsibility. He asked her to prep meals for the week, but she got upset and said it's too much work, suggesting he can make sandwiches if it's too hard. The husband thinks it's reasonable given she's taking the trip.\n\nI need to figure out if the husband is in the wrong. Let's break it down. First, the husband's reasoning: he's relying on his wife to prep meals because he's not as experienced with the kids' preferences, and he doesn't want the kids to have meltdowns. He's asking her to do something before her trip, which might add to her workload. The wife's reaction is that it's too much work, so she's not willing to do it. \n\nIs it fair to ask her to prep meals? Well, she's going on a trip, so maybe she's already busy with packing or other trip-related tasks. If meal prepping is an extra burden on top of that, it might be unreasonable. Also, the husband is expecting her to do something that could be time-consuming right before her trip. On the other hand, he's trying to set himself up for success by having someone else handle the kids' meals, which are tricky for him. \n\nBut here's the thing: he's asking her to do something during her trip's lead-up, which is her time. Maybe he should have considered that she might already have commitments. Also, the alternative he suggested is making sandwiches, which is a valid fallback. Maybe the husband could have offered to handle more at home if needed instead of expecting her to prep. \n\nAnother angle is communication. Did he present the request as a collaborative effort or a demand? If he came across as pressuring her, that could explain her upset reaction. Maybe he should have discussed the plan earlier or offered to help with prep instead of just asking her to do it all. \n\nAlso, considering that she's the one taking the trip, perhaps the husband should take on more responsibility at home. He might be using the kids as leverage to get her to help, even though she's the one leaving. \n\nSo, putting it all together: the husband is asking for something that might be a lot for his wife right before her trip, and perhaps didn't consider her workload. He might be in the wrong because he's expecting her to do more without considering her situation. Therefore, the answer is A (author is in the wrong).\n"
