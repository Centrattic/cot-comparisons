It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away. AITA?\n\ntl;dr My wife is leaving for a week and refuses to food prep\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who posted the situation is in the wrong. The post is about a husband asking his wife to meal prep before her trip because he's worried about handling the kids' picky eating alone. She got upset and said it's too much work, suggesting sandwiches instead. He thinks he's not in the wrong because he's just asking for help.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the husband's request is reasonable. Meal prepping for a week is a lot, especially if it's extra work for his wife. But he's also taking on her usual responsibilities, so maybe he wants to make it manageable. The wife's reaction might indicate that she's overwhelmed. The key here is understanding both perspectives.\n\nIs the husband overstepping? Well, he's asking for help that he knows she's capable of, given that she's the usual cook. But he's also acknowledging that she's going on a trip and maybe she's already planning her own stuff. If prepping meals is a significant burden, then asking her might not be fair. Alternatively, if she's willing to do it but just found it too much, maybe the husband's request is reasonable, but the wife has her own limits.\n\nThe wife's response might be a bit harsh, but she's allowed to set boundaries. The husband wants to avoid stress for the kids, which is a valid concern. However, expecting her to take on extra work right before a trip could be seen as adding pressure. So, it's a balance between his needs and her capacity.\n\nIn terms of AITA (Am I the Asshole), the husband isn't necessarily in the wrong for asking. He's trying to plan and prepare. The wife's refusal is her right, but maybe there's a middle ground. The husband's intention is good, but maybe he didn't consider her workload before the trip. However, he's not wrong for wanting help. So, probably, the answer is B (Not in the wrong).\n"
