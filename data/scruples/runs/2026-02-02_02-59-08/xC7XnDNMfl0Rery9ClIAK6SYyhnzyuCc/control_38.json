      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the husband wants his wife to meal prep for the week she's away on a trip. He's worried about handling the kids and chores alone, especially since cooking is her responsibility. She got upset and said it's too much work and suggested he just make sandwiches.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The wife is going away for the first time since the kids were born. The husband normally handles chores with her, and cooking is her role. He's asking her to prep meals to make his week easier. She's upset, saying it's too much and offers an alternative. The question is whether he's in the wrong for asking.\n\nSo, from his perspective, he's trying to reduce stress by having her prepare meals. He's taking on more responsibilities during her trip. From her perspective, she's being asked to do extra work before her trip. Maybe she's already stressed about the trip or feels overwhelmed. The husband might not be considering her workload or her feelings about being asked to do more.\n\nBut the husband's request seems reasonable. He's not asking her to do something during her trip, just before she leaves. Meal prepping might be a way to help him manage, and he's justifying it by saying he's not as good at knowing the kids' preferences. However, she's the one who's used to cooking, so maybe he's right in assuming she can do it better. But maybe she's already busy with her own preparations for the trip and doesn't have the energy or time to prep meals. \n\nThe key here is communication. Did he present his request in a way that considers her feelings? The wife's reaction was being upset, which suggests that maybe the way he asked or the timing was off. If he hadn't considered her workload or if he made it sound like he's incapable without her, that could be an issue. Also, suggesting that sandwiches are acceptable might not be enough for the kids, but it's a compromise she's offering. \n\nOn the other hand, the husband is trying to plan ahead to avoid meltdowns. He's not wrong for wanting to make things easier. But maybe he didn't consider that prepping a week's worth of meals is a significant task for her, especially before a trip. It's possible that he's not in the wrong because he's addressing a real need, but he could have been more understanding of her situation. However, given the information, the husband's request seems reasonable, and the wife's refusal might be based on her own stress. But since the question is whether he's in the wrong, if his request is reasonable and he's justified in wanting help, then he's not the asshole. \n\nSo, the answer leans towards B (No, he's not in the wrong). But there's a nuance here. Maybe he should have discussed it earlier or considered her workload. But given that the wife is the one who's leaving, it's her responsibility to plan ahead. If she's not willing to help, perhaps the husband isn't wrong in asking. So B.\n"
