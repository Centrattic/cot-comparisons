It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away. AITA?\n\ntl;dr My wife is leaving for a week and refuses to food prep\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for asking his wife to meal prep for the week she's away. The situation is that the wife is going on her first trip since the kids were born, and the author will be handling everything alone. He normally asks her to prep meals because the kids are picky and she knows their preferences better. She got upset, thinking it's too much work, and offered that if it's too hard, he can just make sandwiches.\n\nSo, the author thinks he's not in the wrong because he's trying to avoid meltdowns from the kids not getting their usual food. The user initially thought the author might be in the wrong but is curious about others' perspectives.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the dynamics. The author is asking for help before the wife leaves. Meal prepping for a week isn't something trivial, especially if the kids are picky. The wife might feel that the request is excessive, especially since she's going on a trip and might already be stressed about her time away. It could be a matter of perspective. \n\nBut the key points are: 1) Is the request reasonable? If the author is taking over all her responsibilities, asking her to prep meals before leaving could be seen as a way to ease the transition. However, prepping for an entire week might be a lot of work, and the wife might feel it's an unfair additional burden. \n\nAnother angle: The author is asking for her to do something that she's already doing (cooking) but in a different form (prepping in advance). If she's the main cook, maybe the author should take responsibility now that she's away. The author's reasoning is that he's not as skilled in the kitchen and the kids might have meltdowns otherwise. But is that a valid reason to ask her to prep for a week?\n\nThe wife's response suggests she feels it's too much. So maybe the author didn't consider her feelings about the extra work. Maybe he should have offered alternatives or shared the task. The wife's suggestion to just make sandwiches implies that she doesn't want to do the prep but is offering a compromise. The author's insistence that it's not unfair because she's going away might be missing the point that she's already taking on the trip's responsibilities and might not want the added stress of prepping meals.\n\nIn terms of fairness, if the author is taking over her usual duties during her absence, asking her to do something proactive (meal prep) could be reasonable. However, the amount of work involved in prepping a week's worth of meals is significant. If the author can't manage it himself, even with making sandwiches, maybe the issue is about mutual support and communication.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If he didn't consider her feelings and the workload, maybe. But if he's genuinely trying to avoid problems with the kids and the wife could reasonably prep without it being too much, then maybe not. The answer hinges on whether the request was reasonable and communicated well. The wife's being upset might indicate that he crossed a line, but it's also possible she's overburdened. Without more context, it's tricky. However, since the wife is going away, maybe the author should have taken initiative to adapt rather than expecting her to do more. So perhaps the author is in the wrong.\n"
