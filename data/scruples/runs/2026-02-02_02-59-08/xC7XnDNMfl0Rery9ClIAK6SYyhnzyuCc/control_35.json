She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong for wanting his wife to meal prep before her trip. The situation is that the wife is going on a week-long trip, the first time away from the kids since they were born. The author will be handling all the chores and taking over cooking, which is normally his wife's responsibility. The kids are picky, and the wife knows their preferences better. So he asked her to prep the dinners for the week. She got upset, said it's too much work, and suggested he just make sandwiches if it's too hard.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is taking on a huge responsibility by being alone with the kids for a week. Cooking for picky kids can be stressful, especially if the kids aren't used to different foods. The wife knows their preferences better, so meal prepping might make things easier for him. But the wife is going on a trip, which might already be a big deal for her. Maybe she's stressed about the trip itself and doesn't feel like adding meal prep on top of her travel prep.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's request is reasonable. He's asking for help that's directly related to his upcoming solo parenting challenge. He's not asking her to do something unreasonable; it's a practical request. The wife's response seems a bit dismissive. Saying \"if it gets too hard you can just make them sandwiches\" might minimize the author's request and not take his needs into account.\n\nBut then again, maybe the wife is already overwhelmed with her own travel preparations. Meal prepping for a week could be time-consuming and stressful for her. If the author is asking her to do this right before her trip, it might add to her stress. The wife's refusal could be based on her own limitations rather than being inconsiderate.\n\nThe key here is communication and understanding both sides. The author's intention is to make things manageable for himself, while the wife might feel that the request is adding an extra burden. The author might not be in the wrong because he's trying to plan ahead for a challenging week. However, he might need to consider the wife's perspective more and find a compromise, like prepping just a few meals instead of all. But based solely on the information given, the request itself isn't unreasonable. The wife's reaction might be the issue here. So probably, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
