It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (he) is in the wrong for asking his wife to meal prep before her trip. The wife is going away for a week, and he's worried about handling the kids and chores alone. He normally handles the cooking, but the kids are picky, and he's not as experienced as his wife.\n\nFirst, I need to consider expectations in a relationship. It's common for couples to share responsibilities, but when one partner is traveling, it might be reasonable to ask the other to help with prep work. However, the wife is upset because she thinks it's too much work. Maybe she's already stressed about the trip or the time away. \n\nThe author's request is to have her prep meals for the week. Meal prepping can be time-consuming, and if she's not used to doing it, it might add stress. But the author's reasoning is that he's not as good at cooking the kids' preferred meals, which could lead to meltdowns. He's trying to prevent that. \n\nBut is it unfair to ask her to do this? Well, she's going on a trip, and maybe she's already planning to prep some things. However, if the author took over her chores while she's away, maybe he should have considered that she might have her own pre-trip tasks to manage. Also, he's asking her to do something that's not part of her usual routine\u2014meal prep for a week. \n\nAnother angle: communication. Did he approach her with understanding? Did he consider her workload before the trip? Maybe she's already stressed about packing, work, or other travel-related tasks. If the author had offered to help with the prep instead of just asking her to do it, that might have been better. \n\nAlso, the wife's response suggests that she feels it's too much. If she's not willing to do it, pushing her might create tension. The author might not realize how much work meal prepping is, especially for a week. \n\nIn terms of fairness, it's about balance. The author is trying to manage his own stress, but he's placing the burden on his wife. Maybe there's a middle ground, like her prepping a few meals instead of all, or him learning to cook the kids' favorites. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author might be in the wrong because he's not considering his wife's perspective and workload. He could have found a compromise instead of expecting her to do all the prep. But without more context, like past discussions about responsibilities, it's hard to say for sure. But based on the info given, the answer might lean towards A.\n"
