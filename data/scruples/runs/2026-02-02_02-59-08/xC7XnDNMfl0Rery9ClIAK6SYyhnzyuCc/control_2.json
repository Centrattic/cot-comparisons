It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away.

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for asking his wife to meal prep before her trip.\n\nFirst, the situation: The wife is going away for a week, the first time since the kids were born. The husband will be managing everything alone, including work and chores. Cooking is usually the wife's responsibility, and she knows the kids' preferences better. He asks her to prep dinners for the week, but she gets upset, says it's too much work, and suggests he just make sandwiches if needed.\n\nSo, the husband's reasoning is that it's a week-long trip, he's not used to cooking, and the kids are picky. He wants to avoid meltdowns by having the usual food. He doesn't see it as unfair because she's the one leaving.\n\nNow, to determine if he's in the wrong. Let's consider both sides. The husband is asking for help to manage a challenging week. Meal prepping isn't uncommon in relationships, especially when someone is away. It's a reasonable request to make the transition easier. However, the wife is upset because it's \"too much work,\" implying she might be overburdened or perhaps not used to such requests. But she's the one going away, so maybe she's expecting to carry more responsibility even when she's not there.\n\nIs the request fair? The husband isn't asking her to do something she normally does; he's asking her to prepare for when she's not present. Since she's the primary cook, she knows the kids' preferences better. Meal prepping is a proactive way to help, not an added burden during her trip. She's in a position to help him by prepping before leaving. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe she's already planning to take time to prepare, but finds it too much. If she feels it's excessive, perhaps there's a communication issue. But the husband's concern is valid\u2014picky kids and avoiding meltdowns. He's not asking her to do something she doesn't usually do; he's relying on her expertise.\n\nSo, the husband isn't in the wrong. The wife might be overreacting, perhaps expecting him to handle it without support. The request is reasonable given the circumstances. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
