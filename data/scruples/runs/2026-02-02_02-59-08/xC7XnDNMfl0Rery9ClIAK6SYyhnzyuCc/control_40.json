I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting his wife to meal prep before her trip. The situation is that the wife is going away for a week, the first time she's been away from the kids since they were born. The husband is worried about handling all the chores and cooking, especially since the kids are picky and the wife knows their preferences better. He asked her to prep the dinners for the week, but she got upset and refused, saying it's too much work and suggests he just make sandwiches if it's too hard.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The wife is going on a trip, so it's fair that she might take some responsibility for the week she's away. The husband is taking over her chores, which is a lot, especially with kids and work. Meal prepping could make things easier for him, but the wife feels it's too much. He's concerned about the kids' reactions if the food isn't right.\n\nIs it reasonable to ask someone to prep meals before a trip? Well, if the trip is going to be stressful for the person left behind, it's common for partners to prepare in advance. However, the wife's reaction is a key point here. She might be stressed about the trip itself, or maybe she feels that he's not acknowledging her efforts or the time it takes to prep. Maybe she has her own reasons for not wanting to do it, like the timing before the trip, or other stressors.\n\nThe husband's reasoning is that he's not confident in handling the cooking, which is a valid concern. But is it fair to ask her to prep when she's already going on a trip and might have her own preparations? If she's already stressed about the trip, adding meal prepping might be too much. However, the husband is also managing a lot alone for the first time. \n\nThe question is about whether he's in the wrong. The wife's refusal could indicate that she feels it's an unfair request, especially if she's already taking time off. Maybe there's a communication issue here. The husband might not have considered that the prepping could be a burden on her as well. Alternatively, he's trying to make the transition easier for himself, and that's reasonable.\n\nIn terms of fairness, it's about mutual support. If the wife is going away, she might be expected to help in a way that makes the separation manageable. However, if the request is excessive or unrealistic, it could be seen as wrong. The key is whether the request is reasonable. Meal prepping for a week might be a lot, but if it's within her capability and she's willing when she's not on a trip, maybe he's not in the wrong. But if she's already stressed about the trip, maybe he should have found another solution.\n\nThe answer hinges on whether the request is reasonable. Since the husband is taking over her responsibilities and the kids are picky, meal prepping could be a valid way to help. However, the wife's reaction suggests she feels it's too much, which could mean he didn't consider her perspective. So, maybe he's not in the wrong, but perhaps there's a middle ground. However, the question is strictly whether he is in the wrong. Since he's trying to prepare and the wife's refusal is based on the workload, it's a bit of a toss-up. But the answer is likely B, No, he's not in the wrong because he's trying to manage his responsibilities and the kids' needs.\n"
