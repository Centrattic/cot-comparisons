It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away. AITA?\n\ntl;dr My wife is leaving for a week and refuses to food prep\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. Let me break this down. The author's wife is going on a week-long trip, and he's asking her to meal prep for the kids during that time. He mentions that cooking is her responsibility, and since the kids are picky, he knows she's better at handling their preferences. But she got upset and said it's too much work, suggesting he just make sandwiches if needed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is trying to manage without his wife for a week, who's been handling the cooking. He's concerned about the kids' reactions if the meals aren't as they're used to. His request is reasonable because he's taking on her chores, and meal prepping might help him manage. However, his wife feels it's an extra burden. Maybe she's already stressed about the trip or feels her contribution is being taken for granted.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, he's asking for help, which is understandable. But perhaps he didn't consider her perspective. Maybe he should have offered to share the meal prep or acknowledged her effort. On the other hand, he's in a tough spot with the kids and work. The key points are communication and fairness. If he's not acknowledging her feelings or the added work, that could be the issue. But if he's genuinely trying to prepare and she's unwilling to help, maybe it's a mutual issue. The answer hinges on whether his request was reasonable and considerate. I think he's not in the wrong because he's asking for support in a stressful time, but maybe there's room for better communication. So the answer is B.\n"
