It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away. AITA?\n\ntl;dr My wife is leaving for a week and refuses to food prep\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person is in the wrong for wanting their wife to meal prep before her trip. The situation is that the wife is going away for a week, and the husband is asking her to prepare dinners because he's worried about handling the kids and chores alone. The wife got upset and said it's too much work, suggesting he just make sandwiches if needed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband's request is to ease his burden during the week he's taking over. He's working and managing the kids, so meal prepping could help avoid stress. The wife's response is that it's too much work, and she's already going away, so maybe she's feeling overwhelmed by the additional request. \n\nIs the husband being reasonable? Well, it's her first time away since the kids were born, so maybe she's already stressed about the trip. Adding meal prep might add pressure. But on the other hand, he's asking because he's not confident in handling the kids' picky eating, which is a valid concern. \n\nI should check if the husband is overstepping. He's asking her to do something extra before her trip, which is a common issue in relationships. Some might say he's being reasonable because he's setting up for success, while others might think he's not considering her stress. \n\nThe wife's response about sandwiches seems dismissive. If she's already overwhelmed, maybe she can't take on prepping meals. The husband's intent is to avoid meltdowns, but maybe there's a middle ground, like prepping some meals instead of all. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. \n\nIn terms of fairness, he's asking because he knows his limitations and wants to prevent problems. But maybe he should have communicated better, like offering to do some prep together instead of asking her to do all. Alternatively, he might not realize that asking her after she's taking the trip could be seen as adding stress. \n\nConsidering the AITA (Am I the Asshole?) context, often the answer depends on mutual understanding and communication. If the husband didn't consider that his request adds to her pre-trip stress, he might be in the wrong. However, if he's genuinely concerned about managing the kids, it's a valid request. The wife's reaction might be over the top if she's not willing to help even a little. \n\nI think the answer could be B (not in the wrong) because he's trying to manage responsibilities. But some might argue A if his request is too much. Hmm. Need to weigh both sides. The key is whether the request is reasonable given the circumstances. Since he's the one taking over, it's understandable to want some help, even if it's before the trip. The wife's refusal might be because she's stressed, but that doesn't make the husband's request wrong. So probably B.\n"
