On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting their wife to meal prep before her trip.\n\nFirst, the situation: The wife is going on a week-long trip for the first time since the kids were born. The husband is concerned about handling the kids and chores alone. Cooking is usually the wife's responsibility, and the kids are picky. The husband asks her to prep dinners for the week, but she gets upset, saying it's too much work and suggests he just make sandwiches if needed.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that since the wife is the one leaving, it's fair to ask her to prep. The wife feels it's an added burden. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants a second opinion.\n\nI need to consider both sides. The husband is asking for help to manage the kids' needs, which is understandable. The wife might be feeling overwhelmed with her trip and the added meal prep, especially if she's already preparing for her trip. It's possible that the husband didn't consider her capacity or stress levels. However, the husband's request is to make things easier for himself, which isn't unreasonable. The key here is whether it's fair to expect her to do the prep when she's already leaving. Maybe there's a middle ground, like prepping a few meals or having a different arrangement. The wife's reaction might be valid if she's already stressed about her trip. The husband's request, while well-intentioned, might not take into account her current workload and emotional state. So, there's a balance between the husband's needs and the wife's capacity. But is the husband in the wrong? It's not clear-cut. He's not being unreasonable, but maybe his approach could be adjusted. Considering the wife's perspective, expecting her to prep might add pressure to her trip. Maybe he should have suggested a compromise. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Since the wife is the one leaving, it's somewhat fair to ask for help. But if it's causing her stress, then maybe the husband should consider alternatives. The answer might swing towards B (not in the wrong) because his request is reasonable but perhaps A if the approach was insensitive. But since he's asking her to prep and she's already going away, maybe it's a bit much. Hmm. I think the answer is B because the husband's request is to make things easier for himself, which is reasonable, and the wife's refusal adds to her stress. So the author isn't in the wrong. Wait, but maybe the husband should have asked earlier or considered that she's already preparing for her trip. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. I think B is correct here.\n"
