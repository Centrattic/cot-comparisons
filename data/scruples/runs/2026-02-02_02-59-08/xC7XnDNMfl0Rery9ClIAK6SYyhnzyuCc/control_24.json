      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the wife is going on a week-long trip, the first time away from the kids since they were born. The husband is taking over her chores, including cooking, which the wife usually does. The kids are picky, and he's not as confident in cooking for them. He asked her to prep dinners for the week before she leaves, but she got upset and said it's too much work, suggesting he just make sandwiches if it's hard.\n\nHmm. Let me break this down. The husband's main point is that he's worried about the kids' reactions if he doesn't cook what they're used to. Since the wife knows their preferences better, he wants the meal prep done by her. But she's upset because she thinks it's too much to ask. \n\nFirst, is the request reasonable? The wife is going away for a week. Meal prepping for a week's worth of dinners might take a significant amount of time and effort. If she's already packing for her trip, maybe this is an additional burden. On the other hand, the husband is taking on a lot of new responsibilities, and the wife might be expected to help in some way before leaving.\n\nBut the wife's job is going on the trip. If meal prepping is part of her \"half of the chores,\" then maybe she should have done that before leaving. However, prepping a week's meals might require her to work ahead of her normal routine. Also, she might be stressed about the trip itself and not want extra tasks. The husband's argument is that he's not as skilled, so prepping would help. But the wife's counter is that it's too much work. \n\nIs it fair to ask her to do that? Well, she's the one who's going to be away, so maybe she's in a better position to prep before leaving. But if she's already under a lot of stress or the trip requires her to do a lot of prep for her own needs, adding a week of meals for the kids might be unreasonable. The husband could also consider alternatives, like making a list of kid-approved meals for the week, or maybe involving the kids in simple meal prep tasks. \n\nThe wife's response seems a bit dismissive. Saying \"if it gets too hard you can just make them sandwiches\" might be minimizing the husband's concerns. But the husband's concern is valid if the kids really do get upset when they don't have their usual food. He's probably trying to make sure things go smoothly without her help. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If he's asking her to do something that's a normal part of her responsibilities, then maybe not. But if the request is excessive or doesn't consider her existing workload, then maybe he is. The wife might need to communicate her stress about the trip and why prepping isn't feasible for her. The husband could also take some steps to manage the situation without relying entirely on her. \n\nI think the key here is whether the request is within the normal scope of her duties. If cooking is her responsibility, then meal prepping for the week might be part of that, especially since it's her first time away. However, the wife might feel that she's already dealing with the stress of being away and not wanting to extend her workload. The husband should have discussed this earlier and maybe found a middle ground, rather than assuming she should do all the prep. It's a bit of a gray area. Maybe the author isn't in the wrong, but he could have been more understanding of her situation. The answer might be B (No), but I'm not 100% sure. I need to check if the request is reasonable. If she's responsible for cooking, then prepping in advance could be helpful. However, if it's an unreasonable amount of work, then maybe the author is in the wrong. But the user is asking if the author is in the wrong, so I have to decide based on that. I think the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong because he's trying to anticipate a problem and prepare. The wife's reaction might be valid, but the request itself is reasonable.\n"
