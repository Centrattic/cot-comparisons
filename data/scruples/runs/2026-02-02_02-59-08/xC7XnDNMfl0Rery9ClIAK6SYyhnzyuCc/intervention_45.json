It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation is that the wife is going on a trip and the husband wants her to meal prep for the week she's away. The husband explains that he's not as familiar with the kids' picky eating habits as his wife is, so he wants her to prepare the meals before she leaves. The wife is upset because she thinks it's too much work, and she suggests making sandwiches instead if it's too hard.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze both sides. The husband's reasoning is that since he's taking over her chores and the kids are picky, prepping meals would help him avoid meltdowns from the kids. He thinks it's fair to ask her to do this since she's going away. The wife is upset because she finds it too much work and offers an alternative.\n\nIs the husband wrong for asking her to prepare the meals? Well, he's asking her to do something before her trip, which is a reasonable request because he's not asking her to do it while she's away. However, the wife might feel that she's already preparing for her trip, and adding meal prep could be an extra burden. But the husband's request is for the week before her departure, not during the trip. So maybe he's not making her do work while she's gone. \n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual support. The husband is trying to manage the household during her absence, which is understandable. The wife might feel that her workload is already heavy, or maybe she's stressed about her trip. Perhaps she's not used to being asked to prepare meals in advance, or maybe there's an underlying issue about who is responsible for cooking. \n\nFrom a fairness perspective, if the wife is the one who usually handles the cooking and knows the kids' preferences better, asking her to prep meals that she can make before leaving might be reasonable. However, if she has already communicated her stress about the trip or her workload, maybe the husband should have considered that. But in this case, the husband didn't mention prior issues; he just states that he asked her and she got upset. \n\nThe wife's response suggests she finds it too much work. Maybe she's right to feel that way, but the husband's request is to ease his own burden. It's a common household dynamic where partners have different strengths and responsibilities. The husband is trying to leverage his wife's strengths (her knowledge of the kids' food preferences) to make his week easier. \n\nHowever, the wife might feel that the husband is not considering her time and effort. If meal prepping is a significant task, maybe the husband should have offered to help with some of the prep, or they could have found a middle ground. But the question is whether he's in the wrong for asking. Since he's not making her do it while she's away and it's to help him manage during her absence, it seems like a reasonable request. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the husband is overstepping by not considering her feelings. If she's already stressed about the trip, adding meal prep might be too much. But the husband's main concern is the kids' well-being and avoiding meltdowns. There's a balance between mutual support and respecting each other's capacity. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the husband's request is reasonable and if the wife's refusal is valid. Since the husband is asking her to do something before her trip to help him during her absence, and she's refusing, it's possible that the husband isn't in the wrong. However, maybe he could have approached it differently, like offering to help with the prep or discussing it earlier. But based on the information given, the husband's request seems reasonable. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
