It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away. AITA?\n\ntl;dr My wife is leaving for a week and refuses to food prep\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for asking his wife to meal prep before her trip. The situation is that the wife is going on a week-long trip, and the husband is handling all the chores and cooking for the kids. He asked her to prep dinners for the week because he's not as familiar with the kids' preferences and wants to avoid meltdowns. She got upset and said it's too much work, offering to just make sandwiches if needed.\n\nHmm. First, I need to consider both sides. The husband's perspective is that he's taking on an extra load without help, and he's asking for a favor that's within her capability (since she usually does the cooking). He's worried about the kids' reactions if the meals aren't right. The wife is upset because she thinks meal prepping is too much work, especially since she's going on a trip. She might feel that the request is unreasonable, given the timing and her own stress.\n\nNow, whether the author is in the wrong. The key points here are communication and mutual understanding. The husband might feel he's justified because he's trying to plan ahead. But the wife's reaction suggests that the request might be adding stress for her. Maybe the husband didn't consider how much work meal prepping would be, especially for a week. Alternatively, maybe the wife could have communicated her feelings better.\n\nI need to think about expectations in a relationship. It's common for partners to take on different roles, but when one is away, the other steps in. However, the husband's request might be seen as adding an extra task that the wife isn't comfortable with. The wife's refusal might be about her own capacity, not about not helping. The husband's assumption that she can do it because she usually does the cooking might not account for the fact that she's already stressed about the trip or the prep work.\n\nAlso, the wife's response of \"if it gets too hard you can just make sandwiches\" might indicate she's not willing to help in that specific way, but offers an alternative. The husband's insistence on having the meals prepped might not be considering her feelings or capacity. So maybe the husband is being a bit selfish, not considering her perspective. But then again, he's trying to manage the situation as best as he can.\n\nI think the answer depends on whether the request is reasonable. Meal prepping for a week for picky kids could be time-consuming. The husband might not realize how much work it is. The wife might feel it's an additional burden she's not willing to take on right before her trip. So the husband's request might be valid, but the way he approached it or not considering her stress could be the issue. Therefore, the husband might be in the wrong for not being flexible or understanding her perspective. Answer A.\n"
