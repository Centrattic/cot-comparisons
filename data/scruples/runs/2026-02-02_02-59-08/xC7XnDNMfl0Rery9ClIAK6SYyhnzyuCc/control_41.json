It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away. AITA?\n\ntl;dr My wife is leaving for a week and refuses to food prep\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who posted the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is that the wife is going on a week-long trip, and the husband wants her to meal prep for the week so he can manage the kids and work. The wife is upset and says that's too much work.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The husband is asking his wife to prepare meals in advance because cooking is her responsibility and she knows the kids' preferences better. He's worried about the kids' reactions if he doesn't stick to their usual meals. The wife feels it's too much to ask and suggests sandwiches instead.\n\nSo, is the husband in the wrong? Well, from his perspective, he's trying to prepare for a big change in routine. He's taking over her chores and wants to minimize stress. It's reasonable for him to ask for help, especially since it's her first time away and he's new to handling everything alone. The wife might have her own reasons for not wanting to prep, maybe time constraints or personal limits, but does that make the husband's request wrong?\n\nOn the other hand, the wife might feel that the request is adding extra work on top of her trip preparations. She might have her own needs to prepare for her trip. The husband's request could be seen as not considering her workload. But the husband's intention is to make things easier, not to impose more work. \n\nIn relationships, it's important to communicate and find a middle ground. The husband's request isn't unreasonable, but he might need to understand the wife's perspective. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Since he's asking for support during a period of increased responsibility, it's not necessarily his fault. The wife's reaction is her choice, but the husband isn't wrong for wanting to plan ahead. So the answer is probably B (No, he's not in the wrong).\n"
