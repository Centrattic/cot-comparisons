It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for asking his wife to meal prep before her trip. The situation is that the wife is going on a week-long trip, the first time she's been away from the kids since they were born. The husband is worried about handling cooking and chores alone, especially since the kids are picky and the wife knows their preferences better. He asked her to prep meals, but she got upset and refused, suggesting he can just make sandwiches if it's too much.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband's concern is valid\u2014he's taking on a big responsibility without experience in cooking for the kids. He's asking for help to make sure things don't fall apart. On the other hand, the wife might feel that the request is adding extra work to her trip preparation, which could be stressful, especially if she's already packing and getting ready. She might also feel that her husband is not taking enough responsibility or that he's underestimating her ability to handle the prep, or maybe she's overwhelmed with her own trip prep.\n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual understanding. The husband's request is reasonable in that he's trying to manage a challenging situation. However, the wife's reaction suggests she feels the request is burdensome. It's possible that he didn't consider how much time meal prepping would take her or that she's already stressed about her trip. Alternatively, she might not have considered the husband's stress about handling the kids alone.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, asking for help in a challenging situation isn't inherently wrong. However, it's important to consider the other person's perspective. If the wife felt the request was excessive or if there was a prior understanding about responsibilities, the husband might need to adjust his approach. But the main issue here is whether the request itself is unreasonable. Since the wife is going on a trip, maybe she's already managing a lot, and adding meal prepping could be too much. The husband could have negotiated or offered alternatives, like prepping a few meals instead of all, or asking for help from someone else.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the husband's request is to make things easier for himself during a stressful week. However, the wife's refusal is also valid if she feels it's too much. The question is whether the husband's request was unreasonable. Since the wife is the one who is leaving, perhaps the responsibility should lie with her to make things easier for the husband. Meal prepping could be seen as a helpful act, but if she's overwhelmed, maybe it's not feasible. The husband might not be in the wrong for asking, but he could have approached it differently, maybe by discussing the logistics and finding a middle ground.\n\nSo, considering all this, the answer might be that the author isn't in the wrong (B), but it's a nuanced situation where both parties have valid points. The key is communication and understanding each other's constraints.\n"
