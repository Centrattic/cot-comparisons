It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away. AITA?\n\ntl;dr My wife is leaving for a week and refuses to food prep\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if the author (the husband) is in the wrong for asking his wife to meal prep before her trip. The wife is going away for a week, and the husband is concerned about handling the kids and chores alone, especially cooking, since the kids are picky and the wife knows their preferences better.\n\nFirst, the husband's reasoning: He wants the meal prep because he's worried about managing everything alone and wants to avoid meltdowns. He argues it's fair since she's leaving, so she should prepare. But the wife is upset, saying it's too much work and offers to make sandwiches instead. \n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to evaluate both sides. The husband is trying to plan ahead, which is reasonable. He's taking on extra responsibilities, and asking for help to make it manageable isn't inherently wrong. However, the wife is already going on a trip, which is a personal time. Adding meal prep might be seen as an extra burden she didn't anticipate. \n\nThe key points are: Is the request fair? The husband is not asking her to do the prep while she's away but before her trip. So she has time to do it. However, if she's already made arrangements for her trip and the prep isn't feasible, maybe the request is unreasonable. Also, the wife's reaction might indicate she feels the request is more than what's expected. The husband's concern about the kids' preferences is valid, but does that justify the request?\n\nIs there an alternative? The husband could ask for specific meals she can prep, maybe a few days' worth, instead of the entire week. But he's asking for the whole week. The wife offering sandwiches is a simpler solution, but he's worried about the kids' reactions. However, the wife might feel that the husband should handle it himself since he's the one staying. \n\nThe husband's intention is good, but the way he framed the request might not consider his wife's perspective. Maybe he didn't give her a choice or alternatives. If he's asking her to do something that's adding to her pre-trip stress, that could be the issue. The wife's refusal is a valid response if she feels it's too much. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. On one hand, he's trying to make things easier for himself. On the other, he's imposing an additional task on his wife before her trip. The answer might depend on their usual dynamics. If she usually does the cooking, maybe he should take responsibility now. But if he's genuinely overwhelmed, it's reasonable to seek help. The problem is expecting her to do prep work without considering her workload. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not offering alternatives or being more flexible. Answer A.\n"
