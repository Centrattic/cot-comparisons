It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away. AITA?\n\ntl;dr My wife is leaving for a week and refuses to food prep\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting their wife to meal prep before her trip. The key points here are the wife's upcoming week-long trip, the author taking over her chores, and the request for meal prep.\n\nFirst, the author's reasoning: they need to manage without their wife's help, especially with cooking, which the wife usually does. The kids are picky, and the wife knows their preferences better. The author wants to avoid meltdowns caused by unfamiliar food. They asked her to prep meals for the week.\n\nThe wife's response is that it's too much work and suggests sandwiches instead. The author feels it's fair to ask since the wife is taking the trip.\n\nNow, considering fairness. The author is asking for help that makes sense given the circumstances. They're taking on more responsibilities, so asking for a bit of prep work before the trip seems reasonable. The wife's refusal might be because she finds it burdensome, but the author's request is about practicality and reducing stress during her absence.\n\nPossible angles: Is it reasonable to ask someone to prep meals before a trip? Well, people often meal prep for work or travel. The author is asking for a week's worth, which could be time-consuming. However, since it's before her trip, maybe she can manage. The author's request isn't about control but about coping during her absence.\n\nThe wife's argument is that it's too much work. But maybe she's not considering the author's perspective. The author is not making a unreasonable demand, but a practical one. The wife's alternative (sandwiches) might not be sufficient for picky kids. The author's concern is valid.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Probably not. They're asking for help that's necessary for their situation. The answer would be B (No), because the request is fair given the circumstances.\n"
