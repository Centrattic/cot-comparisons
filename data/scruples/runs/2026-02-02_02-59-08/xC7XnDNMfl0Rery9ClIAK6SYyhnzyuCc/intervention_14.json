It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is at fault for wanting their wife to meal prep before her trip. The situation is that the wife is going away for a week, the first time since the kids were born. The author usually handles chores with the wife, but cooking is her main responsibility. The kids are picky eaters, and the author feels overwhelmed, so they asked her to pre-plan the dinners. The wife was upset, saying that's too much work and offered making sandwiches instead.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The wife is working and taking on extra chores, but the author is asking for something specific\u2014meal prepping for the kids. The key points are: the author is new to cooking and the kids are picky, so they want to avoid meltdowns. The wife is leaving, so maybe she's already stressed about the trip itself. Meal prepping adds an extra task, which she finds unreasonable.\n\nThe author argues that it's fair because the wife is going on the trip and they need help. But the wife's response suggests she might feel the request is excessive, especially if the trip is already a big deal. Maybe the author didn't consider that the wife might be preparing for the trip and has her own tasks, so adding meal prepping is too much. Also, the author's alternative of sandwiches might not be feasible or preferred, but it's a suggestion to ease the burden.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author might be in the wrong if they didn't discuss the request in a considerate way, or if they didn't acknowledge the wife's own preparations. Meal prepping for a week can be time-consuming and might require planning beyond just cooking. The wife might feel it's an added stress, especially if the trip is significant. Alternatively, the author's request is reasonable for someone unfamiliar with the kids' preferences to avoid problems.\n\nBut the wife's reaction is a bit harsh. She's the one going on the trip, so perhaps she should have anticipated the need for meal prep. However, it's possible she has her own reasons for not wanting to do it, like the time it takes or the stress of ensuring the author can manage. The author's alternative of sandwiches might not be ideal, but it's a valid offer. The question is about fairness. Since the wife is the one leaving, maybe it's reasonable to ask her to take care of the meal prep in advance. But the author's approach could be seen as not considering her workload or stress. Alternatively, the author is being practical and trying to maintain routine for the kids, which is important for their well-being.\n\nI think the answer depends on whether the request was made in good faith and if the wife's refusal is justified. Meal prepping is a common way for people to manage when someone else is taking over cooking. But if the wife is already overwhelmed with her own trip preparations, it might be too much. The author might not be in the wrong if they're genuinely trying to help and the wife is being unreasonable. However, if the author didn't give her enough time or didn't consider her own situation, maybe they are. The key here is mutual understanding. The author might not be in the wrong if the request is reasonable and the wife is being overly resistant. But I'm not sure. The alternative is that meal prepping is a shared responsibility, and the author is expecting the wife to continue contributing even when she's away, which could be unfair. Wait, but the author is asking her to do something before she leaves, not while on the trip. So it's a proactive step. The wife might feel it's a last-minute request, adding to her stress. The author could have discussed this earlier. But the scenario doesn't mention that. It's possible the author is in the wrong if they didn't communicate properly or if the request is seen as adding to the wife's already heavy workload. Alternatively, it's a reasonable request for support. I'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because they're preparing for a situation where they might be overwhelmed, but it's a close call. The answer might be B (No), but I need to check the details again. The wife is the one leaving, so maybe the author is just asking for a bit of help before she goes. The key is that the author is handling the chores and wants to avoid problems with the kids' meals. If the wife is upset because it's too much work, perhaps the author should have considered other solutions, but the request itself isn't unreasonable. I think the author isn't in the wrong. So Answer B.\n"
