I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person (AITA) is in the wrong for asking his wife to meal prep before her trip. The situation is that the wife is going away for a week, their first time apart since the kids were born. The husband has to take over her chores and cooking. The kids are picky, and the wife knows their preferences better. He asked her to prep dinners for the week, but she got upset, saying it's too much work. He thinks it's reasonable since she's going away.\n\nSo, I need to figure out if he's wrong. Let's break it down. The main points are: he's asking her to prep meals to make his week easier, but she's upset because it's too much. Maybe the problem is about expectations and communication. \n\nFirst, the husband has a valid reason. He's worried about the kids' reactions if the food isn't right. The wife knows their preferences better, so having her prep might help maintain consistency. But she's taking a trip, which is a big deal, and he's asking her to do extra work before leaving. Maybe she's already stressed about the trip and the added responsibility is too much.\n\nIs it unfair? Well, he's not asking her to do it during her trip, just before she leaves. The trip is her time away, so expecting her to take on more work right before might be seen as adding to her stress. On the other hand, it's a reasonable request to make things easier for him while she's away. \n\nBut maybe there's a lack of consideration for her current workload. If she's already busy with packing for the trip, her job, or other responsibilities, asking her to prep meals might be too much. Also, he's assuming she can do it, but she might have different priorities. \n\nAlternatively, maybe he should have offered to help with the prep, or suggested another solution. Instead of just asking her, maybe a collaborative approach would have been better. But he's under the impression that she's better at cooking, so maybe he's trying to be practical.\n\nThe key here is whether the request is reasonable. Since she's going on a trip, perhaps the timing is inconvenient. She might feel that the trip is her time to relax, and the prep is an added burden. He's not wrong in wanting help, but maybe he's not considering her perspective. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. But since he's the one making the request and she's the one who feels it's too much, maybe he's not entirely in the wrong. However, he could have approached it differently. But according to the question, the answer is either A or B. The options are whether he's in the wrong. If the consensus is that he's not wrong, then B. If there's a significant fault, then A. \n\nLooking at similar situations, often people might say that expecting someone to do extra work before a trip might be a bit much. So maybe the answer is B, he's not in the wrong. But sometimes, it's about communication. However, the question is about being in the wrong, not about the best approach. Since his request is based on practicality and he's not forcing her but asking, maybe he's not wrong. So B.\n"
