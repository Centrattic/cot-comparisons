It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away. AITA?\n\ntl;dr My wife is leaving for a week and refuses to food prep\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a husband asking his wife to meal prep before her trip, but she refused. The husband is taking over her chores for a week, and he wants the meal prep to manage the kids' picky eating. The wife got upset, saying it's too much work and suggested he could make sandwiches instead.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband's reasoning is that since the wife knows the kids' food preferences better, and he's already taking on extra chores, meal prepping would help avoid meltdowns from the kids not getting their usual food. The wife is taking a week-long trip, which is her first time away from the kids. The husband is asking her to do something reasonable, but she's resistant, maybe because it's an extra task on top of her trip preparations.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate. The key points here are communication, expectations, and mutual support. The husband is trying to make things easier for himself, which is understandable. However, the wife might be overwhelmed with her own trip preparations. Did the husband consider how much work meal prepping would add to her? Maybe he didn't discuss it well enough. But the wife's response was dismissive, suggesting sandwiches, which might not be practical if the kids are picky. \n\nIs it fair to ask her to prep? Well, since she's going on a trip, maybe it's reasonable to ask for some help. However, the way he asked could matter. If he came across as demanding without considering her workload, that's a problem. On the other hand, if she didn't offer to help, maybe the husband is just asking for a reasonable compromise. \n\nThe husband's main issue is wanting to avoid stress during the week. The wife's refusal could be due to her own stress about the trip. Maybe there's a middle ground, like prepping a few meals instead of all. The question is whether the husband's request is unreasonably expecting her to do all the work when she's already going on a trip. But since cooking is her usual responsibility, asking her to help with prep before leaving isn't necessarily wrong. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the husband should have offered to do some of the prep work himself instead of expecting her to do it all. But he did ask her to prep, which she normally does. The wife's reaction might be a result of feeling burdened. So perhaps the husband is trying to be reasonable, but the wife's response was not supportive. \n\nIn terms of fault, if the husband's request was reasonable and within the wife's capacity, then he's not wrong. But if he didn't consider her workload, maybe he is a bit. However, the wife's refusal might be the bigger issue here. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer would depend on whether the request was unreasonable. Since the author is asking for the wife to do something that's part of her usual role, and given the circumstances, it's a valid request. So the answer might be B (he's not in the wrong). But if the wife is already stressed and the prep is too much, then maybe the husband should have adjusted. But the user says they think the author is in the wrong, but I need to decide based on the scenario.\n"
