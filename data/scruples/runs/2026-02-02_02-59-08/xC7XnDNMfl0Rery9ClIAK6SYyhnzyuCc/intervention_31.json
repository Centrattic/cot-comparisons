It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away. AITA?\n\ntl;dr My wife is leaving for a week and refuses to food prep\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking their wife to meal prep before her trip. The main points from the author's side are that they're taking over all the chores and cooking, which they're not as comfortable with since the kids are picky. They want the meal prep to avoid meltdowns.\n\nThe wife is upset because she thinks it's too much work. The author argues it's fair since she's going on the trip. But wait, meal prepping isn't part of her trip; she's doing it for the kids while she's away. So, is it reasonable to ask her to do that before she leaves?\n\nI need to consider both sides. The author is asking for help in a time when they'll have more responsibilities. The wife might be overwhelmed already, maybe she's preparing for the trip herself. If meal prepping is a big task, adding that could be a burden. On the other hand, the author might be trying to make things easier for themselves. But the author could have offered to help with the prep or found another solution, like ordering groceries or getting some meals delivered. If the wife feels it's too much, maybe the author didn't consider her workload. So maybe the author is in the right by trying to prepare, but perhaps they should have communicated better or offered to assist. Alternatively, if the wife is already stressed about the trip, asking her to do extra work before leaving might be unfair. So the answer could be either way. But the key is whether the request is reasonable. Since the wife is going on a trip, maybe the author should have anticipated this and planned differently. Hmm. I think the author isn't entirely in the wrong because they're trying to manage their own stress, but maybe they should have discussed it more and found a compromise. However, the wife's reaction might be valid if she's already busy. It's a bit tricky. Maybe the author isn't in the wrong (B) because they're trying to make things easier, but the wife's refusal is also understandable. So answer B.\n"
