It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking his wife to meal prep before her trip. The situation is that the wife is going away for a week, and the husband is worried about managing the kids and chores, especially since cooking is the wife's usual responsibility.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband's reasoning is that the kids are picky eaters, and since the wife knows their preferences better, prepping meals would make his week easier. The wife, however, got upset because she thinks it's too much work and offers to just make sandwiches if needed. The husband feels it's not unfair to ask her to prep since she's going away.\n\nI should think about communication and expectations. The husband is looking for support to handle the week without meltdowns, but maybe the wife feels overwhelmed by the extra work on top of her trip preparations. Maybe she's already stressed about being away and doesn't want the added pressure of meal prepping. The husband might not have considered her workload or her perspective. \n\nAlso, the wife's response of offering sandwiches suggests that she's trying to compromise. The husband might not have left room for her to decline gracefully or found an alternative solution. The key here is whether the request was reasonable. Meal prepping for a week can be time-consuming, especially with kids' meals. If the husband didn't check with her earlier or didn't consider that she might have other things to do before her trip, that could be a problem.\n\nAnother angle: the husband is asking for help, but maybe he's not sharing the load equally. If he's willing to make sandwiches but expects her to prep other meals, is that fair? Or does he need to take on more responsibility himself instead of expecting her to do extra before her trip?\n\nSo, the husband's request might be reasonable, but the way he approached it or the lack of consideration for his wife's workload could be the issue. The wife's reaction shows she feels it's too much, so maybe the husband didn't take into account that she's already dealing with her own stress of leaving.\n\nIn terms of fairness, asking someone to prep meals before a trip might be a common request, but it depends on the circumstances. If the wife is already busy, asking for more might not be fair. The husband's intention is to avoid meltdowns, but the wife's refusal might be valid if she's already stretched thin.\n\nSo, the answer might lean towards the husband not being in the wrong, but there's a nuance in how the request was made. However, since the wife's refusal is about the extra work being too much, the husband's request might not be entirely unreasonable, but maybe he should have been more flexible or found another solution. Since the question is whether he's in the wrong, the answer could be B (No) because his request is understandable, but he might need to adjust his approach. But considering the wife's perspective, maybe there's a middle ground. However, the key here is whether the author is in the wrong. If the request is reasonable given the circumstances, then B. If not, A. The answer is B, no, he's not in the wrong.\n"
