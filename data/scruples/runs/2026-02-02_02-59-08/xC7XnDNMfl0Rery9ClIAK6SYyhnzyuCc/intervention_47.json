It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away. AITA?\n\ntl;dr My wife is leaving for a week and refuses to food prep\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for asking his wife to meal prep before her trip. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the wife is going away for a week, which is her first time away from the kids since they were born. The husband will have to handle all the chores and cooking alone. The kids are picky eaters, and the wife knows their preferences better because she's cooked more. He asked her to prep dinners for the week, but she got upset and said that's too much work. She offered that he could just make sandwiches if it gets too hard.\n\nThe husband's reasoning is that he doesn't want the kids having meltdowns over unfamiliar food. He doesn't think it's unfair since she's taking a week off. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nHmm. So, the key points here are about fairness and expectations. The husband is asking for help that would make his solo week easier, but the wife feels the request is too much. Meal prepping for a week can be time-consuming and labor-intensive. The wife might already be stressed about the trip and the added responsibility of prepping meals could be overwhelming. \n\nOn the other hand, the husband is trying to prevent potential problems with the kids and is relying on his wife's cooking expertise. But is it fair to ask her to do that before her trip? Maybe there's an imbalance in the division of labor. If the wife is already handling most of the cooking, and now she's being asked to do extra work before leaving, that might be seen as adding to her burden right before she's supposed to relax. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the husband isn't considering that the wife might have other things to do before her trip, like packing or preparing for her own activities. Meal prepping is a significant task, and if the wife feels it's too much, it's a valid concern. The husband could have offered to help with the prep or suggested an alternative that's less work for her, like prepping just a few meals instead of all.\n\nThe wife's response of suggesting sandwiches if it's too hard might indicate that she's trying to be helpful but finds the request unreasonable. The husband's insistence might be coming from a place of needing help, but not considering her capacity or stress levels.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong because he didn't consider his wife's capacity and the additional workload. He could have communicated better or found a compromise. The key is whether the request was reasonable given the circumstances. Meal prepping for a week is a big ask, especially when she's already handling most of the cooking at home. The author's approach might have been a bit self-centered, not considering her perspective.\n"
