It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away. AITA?\n\ntl;dr My wife is leaving for a week and refuses to food prep\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting their wife to meal prep before her trip. The situation is that the wife is going away for a week, and the husband is asking her to prepare meals because he's worried about the kids' picky eating and his ability to handle the extra chores.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband's reasoning is that he's taking over her responsibilities during her absence, and meal prepping would make things easier for him, especially since the kids are used to the wife's cooking. He also mentions it's their first time apart since the kids were born, so he's concerned about managing everything alone.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife is upset because she feels it's too much work to ask her to prep meals. She suggests that if things get hard, he can just make sandwiches. That implies she might not have the capacity or willingness to take on additional work before her trip, perhaps because she's already stressed about being away or has her own preparations to handle.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate that. The key points here are communication and mutual support. The husband is trying to plan ahead to avoid stress, which is reasonable. However, the wife's reaction suggests that she might feel overwhelmed or that her needs aren't being considered. The question is whether the husband's request is reasonable or if he's overstepping.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, it's not unreasonable for the husband to ask for help in managing the household during her absence. However, the way the request was made or the assumption that she must prepare meals might not consider her current capacity. The wife's response indicates she's not comfortable with the request, which points to a possible lack of communication or understanding of her situation. \n\nIt's also important to consider that the wife is taking a significant trip, which might be a positive change for her, but she might be dealing with her own anxieties. If the husband is expecting her to do extra work right before her trip, that could add stress. Alternatively, if she's capable and willing, then his request is valid. But since she's upset, maybe the request wasn't framed in a way that acknowledges her feelings or offers alternative solutions.\n\nAnother angle: meal prepping is a form of labor. The husband is used to her doing that, so he's trying to maintain routine. However, expecting her to do extra work when she's about to leave might not be fair, especially if she's already dealing with her own pre-trip tasks. The husband could have offered to handle more at home or adjust their usual routine instead of expecting her to take on more.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the husband is stepping up to take over her chores, which is commendable. But if the wife is already stretched thin, adding meal prep might be too much. The key issue is whether the husband considered her perspective and communicated his needs in a way that's collaborative rather than demanding.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the husband didn't communicate his request in a supportive way, or if he's not considering the wife's current workload and emotions, then he might be in the wrong. However, if he genuinely needs the support and the wife isn't willing to adjust, it's a mutual issue. But since the wife is the one who is upset and refused, perhaps the husband's request is a bit much, especially if it's an added responsibility she didn't anticipate when planning her trip.\n"
