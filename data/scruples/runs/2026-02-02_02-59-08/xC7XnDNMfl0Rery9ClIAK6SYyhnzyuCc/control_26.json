It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away. AITA?\n\ntl;dr My wife is leaving for a week and refuses to food prep\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who posted the question is in the wrong. The situation is that he wants his wife to meal prep for their kids before her week-long trip. She's upset about it, saying it's too much work, and he thinks it's reasonable because he's not as good with the kids' picky eating.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband is taking on extra responsibility during his wife's absence, which makes sense. He's asking for help to manage the kids' meals, which could be stressful. On the other hand, the wife is going on a trip, which is her time to relax or do other things, and meal prepping might be a big task, especially if she's already packing and getting ready for the trip.\n\nIs it fair to ask her to prep meals before her trip? Well, if she's the primary cook and knows the kids' preferences better, maybe it's a practical solution. But he's asking her to do something extra during a time when she's probably busy with her travel preparations. Maybe he should have offered to help more at home instead, or they could have split the prep work. Also, she's taking a break, so it's possible she doesn't want to be burdened with more work right before leaving.\n\nThe key points are: he's trying to manage his responsibilities, she's taking time off, and they're having a conflict over how to divide the work. The question is whether his request is unfair. Since he's not asking her to do something during her trip, just before it, maybe it's reasonable. But the wife might feel that prepping a week's worth of meals is too much added stress. It's a balance between their needs and expectations.\n\nI think it's not entirely his fault, but maybe he didn't consider her perspective enough. He could have communicated better, maybe offered to help with some of the prep himself or suggested alternatives. But he's not necessarily in the wrong for wanting to make sure the kids eat well. So the answer might be B (No), but with the understanding that both sides need to communicate better.\n"
