It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away. AITA?\n\ntl;dr My wife is leaving for a week and refuses to food prep\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole?) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author wants his wife to meal prep for the week she's away on a trip. The wife is leaving for a week, and the author is concerned about managing the kids' meals, especially since they're picky and the wife usually handles cooking. The author asked her to prep the meals in advance, but she got upset and said it's too much, suggesting he just make sandwiches if needed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's reasoning is that since the wife usually cooks and knows the kids' preferences better, asking her to prep meals before the trip would make things easier. The wife, on the other hand, feels it's too much work and is upset about the request. \n\nIs the author being reasonable? Well, the wife is going on a trip, and the author is taking on her responsibilities for the week. Meal prepping could save time and reduce stress for the author. However, the wife might feel that the request is an additional burden on top of her trip preparations. Maybe she's already busy with packing and other travel-related tasks, so adding meal prep could be overwhelming. \n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual understanding. The author's intention is to avoid meltdowns with the kids, which is a valid concern. But the wife's reaction suggests she feels the request is unreasonable. The author might not realize that the wife is already stressed about her trip or that she might prefer flexibility in her time away. \n\nIs there a middle ground? Perhaps they could discuss alternatives. For example, the wife could prep some meals while also allowing the author to handle others, or maybe they could adjust the kids' meal expectations. The author's approach might come across as demanding without considering the wife's current workload and feelings. \n\nIn terms of fairness, it's about balance. The author is trying to manage the household during the wife's absence, but the wife might feel that the request is unfair because she's already taking time away. The question is whether the request is reasonable given the circumstances. \n\nI think the author isn't necessarily in the wrong, but there's a lack of understanding from both sides. The wife's reaction is valid if she feels overwhelmed. The author's request might be reasonable but could be phrased more collaboratively. Since the wife is the one who is upset, it might not be about right or wrong but about communication and compromise. However, the author's perspective is that he's trying to make things easier, which is understandable. \n\nIn the end, the answer might depend on how the request was made. If the author was considerate and open to other solutions, maybe the wife would have been more receptive. But given the information, the author's request seems reasonable, and the wife's refusal might be due to her own stress. So, maybe the author isn't in the wrong, but there's room for better communication.\n"
