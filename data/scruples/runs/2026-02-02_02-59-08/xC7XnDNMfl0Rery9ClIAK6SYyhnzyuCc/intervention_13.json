It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away. AITA?\n\ntl;dr My wife is leaving for a week and refuses to food prep\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the husband wants his wife to meal prep for the week she's away on a trip. The wife is upset because she thinks it's too much work, and she's going to be gone. The husband argues that cooking is her responsibility, and since the kids are picky, he's not confident he can handle it alone.\n\nHmm. So, first, I need to consider both sides. The husband is asking for help with something that's part of his wife's usual responsibilities. He's taking on a lot with the kids and work, so it makes sense he wants some support. But the wife is going away, so she's not there to help. If she preps the meals, she's not even present to cook them. That might be why she's upset\u2014she's being asked to work hard just before her trip. \n\nIs it fair to ask her to prep a week's worth of meals when she's about to leave? Maybe she's already busy packing for her trip, dealing with the logistics, and then this extra task is added. The husband's intention is good\u2014he doesn't want the kids to have meltdowns over unfamiliar food. But maybe he should have considered how much work meal prepping would be for his wife. \n\nAlso, the wife is not refusing to help entirely; she's saying if it's too hard, he can make sandwiches. So she's offering an alternative. The husband's issue is that he doesn't want to make sandwiches, but he's upset she's not doing the prep. Maybe there's a middle ground here. Like, maybe she can prep a few meals and he can handle the rest, or maybe they can adjust the menu to something simpler that he can manage. \n\nAnother angle: Is it fair to assign her the task when she's not there? If she's gone, she can't actually cook the meals, so prepping them in advance is the only way. But if that's too much, maybe the husband needs to step up and learn to cook the kids' favorite meals, or they can agree on a different solution. \n\nI think the key points are communication and mutual support. The husband's request comes from a place of needing help, but he might not have considered how burdensome the request is for his wife. The wife's response might be valid because she's also feeling stretched thin. So maybe the husband is in the wrong because he's expecting her to take on extra work right before her trip without considering her perspective. Alternatively, he's not in the wrong because he's trying to manage his responsibilities with the kids and work. \n\nI'm a bit torn here. On one hand, he's trying to ask for help. On the other, he's imposing a task that might be too much for his wife. The answer might depend on their usual dynamics. If meal prep is part of her routine, maybe it's reasonable. But if it's a lot and she's already stressed about her trip, then maybe he should adjust. \n\nI think the author is in the right in wanting support but might have been too demanding. The answer is probably B (not in the wrong), but I'm not 100% sure. Maybe the wife's response was overly dismissive. Wait, she said if it's too hard, he can make sandwiches. That's a bit dismissive, but maybe she's frustrated. \n\nOverall, I think the author isn't in the wrong because he's trying to manage a big responsibility by asking for help. The wife's reaction might be valid, but the request itself isn't unreasonable. So the answer is B.\n"
