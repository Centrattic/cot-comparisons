It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away. AITA?\n\ntl;dr My wife is leaving for a week and refuses to food prep\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author's wife is going on a trip, and he wants her to meal prep for the week when she's away. His reasoning is that he's not as good at cooking as his wife, especially with the kids being picky. The wife gets upset because he's asking her to do too much work. The author thinks it's fair to ask since she's taking the trip.\n\nHmm. So first, I need to evaluate whether asking her to prep meals is reasonable. The wife is going on her first solo trip since the kids were born. The author is taking over her chores, so maybe expecting her to do some prep before leaving makes sense. But the wife feels it's too much. Maybe she's already planning to be away, so adding meal prep might add stress. \n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual understanding. The author's intention is to make things easier for himself. But is that a valid reason? It's common for couples to share responsibilities. If the wife is already stressed about the trip or the prep, maybe the author didn't consider her feelings. However, the author's concern about the kids' meltdowns if the food isn't right shows he's trying to manage the kids' needs.\n\nBut is it fair to expect her to prep when she's going to be away? If she's the one who's been doing the cooking, it's natural she knows the kids' preferences. But the trip is her time to be away, and the prep might be an extra burden. The wife might feel that the author isn't picking up his share or is not confident in his abilities. The author might be underestimating his own ability to handle the cooking, leading to the wife feeling pressured.\n\nThe answer here could depend on their usual dynamics. If they share responsibilities, maybe the author is overstepping by asking her to take on more before her trip. Alternatively, if meal prep is a shared responsibility, the author is being reasonable. But since the wife is upset, maybe the author didn't consider her workload or feelings. So, the author might be in the wrong for not being empathetic enough. But maybe it's a reasonable request. It's a bit tricky. I think the answer is A (in the wrong) because the author didn't consider her perspective and the prep might be too much, especially since she's going on a trip.\n"
