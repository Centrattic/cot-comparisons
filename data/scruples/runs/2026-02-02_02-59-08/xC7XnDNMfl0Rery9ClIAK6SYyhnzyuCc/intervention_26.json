It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for asking his wife to meal prep before her trip. So, the situation is that the wife is going away for a week, and the husband is worried about managing the kids and chores alone. Cooking is her responsibility, and he wants her to prep meals so he doesn't have to deal with picky eaters. She got upset, thinking it's too much work and maybe suggests making sandwiches instead.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband's perspective is that since he's not used to cooking and the kids are picky, he's asking for help to make things easier. The wife is taking the trip, so maybe she's supposed to take some responsibilities with her? But she's already cooking all the time, so maybe expecting her to prep for a week is asking for more than she can handle. \n\nHe's asking her to do something for the week she's away. That might feel like an extra task on top of her existing responsibilities. If she's already doing the cooking, asking her to preplan and prep meals for the week might be a lot, especially if she's busy with other things before her trip. Also, the wife's reaction is getting upset, which suggests she might feel it's unfair or too much. \n\nBut the husband's argument is that he's not used to cooking and wants to avoid meltdowns from the kids. Maybe he's not considering that she might not want to spend her time before the trip prepping meals, or that she might have other things to do. Alternatively, maybe he's trying to be proactive and reasonable. \n\nI need to think about what a fair division of labor is here. If the wife is taking a break, perhaps the husband is expected to take over her usual tasks. Meal prepping might be part of that, but if she's not there, maybe it's not feasible. However, expecting her to prep before leaving might be a way to ease the transition. \n\nBut the key point is whether the request is reasonable. If the wife is going away, maybe it's normal to ask her to do any prep before she leaves to make things easier. However, if she's already responsible for cooking, asking her to do extra prep work might be seen as adding to her workload, especially if she's not comfortable with it. \n\nAlso, the wife's response of suggesting sandwiches might be a way to say she doesn't want to do the meal prep. Maybe the husband is not respecting her limits here. If she's already stressed about the trip or has her own preparations, asking her to prep meals could be too much. \n\nSo, the husband's intention is to make things easier for himself, but he's not considering his wife's perspective or workload. Maybe he should have offered to handle the cooking but asked for some guidance, like a list of recipes or ideas she can share. Alternatively, they could compromise on the number of meals she preps. \n\nIn terms of fairness, if the wife is taking the trip and wants to leave the house in good condition, prepping meals might be a way to help. But it's possible she feels it's unreasonable, especially if she's already doing the cooking. The husband might not realize that she might have other things to do before her trip. \n\nI think the author is not in the wrong because he's trying to make things manageable for himself, but maybe the answer is more nuanced. However, given the options, I need to decide between A or B. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate again.\n\nIf the wife is responsible for cooking, then asking her to plan and prep meals for the week she's away might be a reasonable request. After all, she knows the kids' preferences best, so she can ensure they're happy. The fact that she got upset might indicate she's not used to being asked to do that, or maybe she's overburdened. But the husband's reasoning is valid. Alternatively, maybe he should have discussed it earlier instead of expecting her to do it last-minute. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the wife's refusal is valid because she's taking a trip, so expecting her to do the prep might not consider her own needs. The husband could have offered to handle the cooking but just needs some support from her in terms of recipes or guidance. \n\nConsidering all that, the husband might not be in the wrong because he's trying to prepare, but the wife's reaction is understandable. However, whether he's in the wrong depends on the fairness of the request. If it's a normal part of her responsibilities to prep for such a trip, then it's okay. If it's an added task, maybe not. Since cooking is her responsibility, asking her to prep before leaving might be fair. Therefore, the answer might be B (not in the wrong). But the user thinks A is correct. Hmm.\n\nWait, but the user says they think the author is in the wrong. Maybe because he's expecting her to take on extra work when she's already doing the cooking. Maybe the husband should have taken over cooking himself, even if it's harder, instead of asking her to do more. So maybe the author is in the wrong for adding to her workload. \n\nBut the husband is asking her to do something before she leaves, so it's not an ongoing responsibility. It's a one-time pre-trip task. That might be fair. So I'm a bit torn here. However, the answer might depend on cultural expectations or how the request was made. Since the wife got really upset, maybe the husband's request was not considered in terms of her capacity. \n\nIn conclusion, I think the answer is B (not in the wrong) because the husband is trying to manage his responsibilities and asking for help in a reasonable way. The wife's reaction might be due to stress or other factors, but the request itself is not inherently wrong.\n"
