It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author wants his wife to meal prep for the week she's away on a trip. The wife is going on her first trip since the kids were born, and the author will be handling all the chores and kids alone. Cooking is her usual responsibility, and she knows the kids' preferences better. He asked her to prep meals for the week to make it easier, but she got upset, saying that's too much work and offered to just make sandwiches if needed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's argument is that he's trying to make things easier for himself during a stressful time when he's already taking on more responsibilities. He's asking for help from the wife before she leaves, which might be reasonable. But the wife is upset because she might feel that the request is adding extra work on top of her trip preparations. Maybe she's already stressed about her trip and the added task of meal prepping is too much. Or maybe she perceives the request as not trusting her to handle the situation, or perhaps she feels it's unfair for her to do the prep when she's not even there.\n\nI should also think about the dynamics of their relationship. If meal prepping is part of her usual responsibilities but now he's asking her to do more before leaving, maybe she's not okay with that. On the other hand, the author is trying to be proactive to avoid problems with the kids. The key points here are communication and mutual understanding. Did they discuss this before? Is this a recurring issue, or is it a one-time thing? The wife might feel that the author should handle it himself since she's not there, or she might feel it's reasonable to help out before leaving.\n\nAnother angle is the emotional aspect. The wife might be feeling overwhelmed with her own trip and not want to take on extra tasks. The author might not be considering her stress levels. Alternatively, the author's request is reasonable because he's setting himself up for a smoother week. But expecting her to prepare meals might be crossing into being too much, especially if she's already busy with her trip.\n\nI need to check if there's a cultural or societal expectation here. In many relationships, dividing responsibilities is a matter of mutual agreement. If the author usually does the cooking but relies on her knowledge, maybe a middle ground could be found, like her writing down the preferences or prepping some ingredients instead of full meals.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the wife is already stressed about her trip, maybe he should have considered her perspective more. However, his request is to make things easier during a challenging week. It's a balance between being proactive and respecting the partner's limits. If the wife clearly said it's too much, then maybe the author should find another solution instead of pressuring her further. On the flip side, if meal prepping is part of her usual duties, it's fair to ask her to handle that before leaving. \n\nHmm, but the wife's response was negative, so maybe he didn't take her feelings into account. The author might not be in the wrong for wanting help, but perhaps the way he asked or the expectation that she has to do it is where the issue lies. The key is whether the request is reasonable given the circumstances and mutual responsibilities.\n"
