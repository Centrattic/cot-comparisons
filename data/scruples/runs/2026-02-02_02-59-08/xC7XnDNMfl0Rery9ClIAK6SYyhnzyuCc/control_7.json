It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away. AITA?\n\ntl;dr My wife is leaving for a week and refuses to food prep\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the husband is at fault for asking his wife to meal prep before her trip. The main points are that the wife is going away for a week, which is the first time she's been away from the kids since they were born. The husband is taking over her chores, including cooking, which he's not as confident with because the kids are picky and the wife knows their preferences better.\n\nHe asked her to prep meals in advance to make his life easier. She got upset, thinking it's too much work, and suggested maybe sandwiches instead. He feels it's fair since she's taking a week off. \n\nNow, to determine if he's in the wrong. Let's consider the dynamics here. Marriage often involves shared responsibilities, and when one partner is stepping up to take over another's duties, it's reasonable to expect some preparation. The husband is asking for help to avoid potential issues with the kids. However, the wife might feel overwhelmed by the request, especially if she's already preparing for her trip. \n\nIs the request unreasonable? Maybe not. He's not asking for much, just prepping meals. But he should also consider her capacity. The key here is communication. If he approached her calmly and explained his concerns, it's a valid request. However, if he made it sound like an ultimatum or didn't consider her workload, then maybe he's overstepping. \n\nBut the scenario doesn't indicate that. He says he wants to avoid meltdowns from the kids not getting their usual food. That's understandable. Since she's the one who normally cooks and knows their preferences, her prep would help. The fact that she's going on a trip, he's taking over, so she's aware of the situation. \n\nHer getting upset might be because she feels it's too much, maybe she's busy with her trip prep. But the husband isn't wrong in seeking support. It's a reasonable request to make things smoother for everyone. So, I think the answer is B, he's not in the wrong. However, there's a need for mutual understanding here. Both should communicate better to ensure the request is feasible for her. But based on the given info, he's justified in asking.\n"
