It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for asking their wife to meal prep before her trip. The situation is that the wife is going on a week-long trip, and the husband wants her to prep meals because he's not confident in handling the kids' picky eating. The wife is upset, thinking it's too much work.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband has a valid reason: he's worried about managing the kids and work alone. Meal prepping could help him avoid meltdowns. But the wife feels it's an unfair extra burden. Maybe she's already stressed about her trip or feels her time is limited. The question is whether the request is reasonable.\n\nThe husband is asking her to do something that's outside her usual responsibilities, but since she's the main cook, it makes sense he'd want her to prep. However, the wife is taking the trip, so maybe she's already busy packing or dealing with her own plans. Is it fair to add meal prepping to her to-do list? It depends on their usual dynamics. If they've never discussed this before, maybe he should have asked earlier or offered to take on some tasks in return. Alternatively, maybe the wife could see it as a kind gesture but is overwhelmed.\n\nAnother angle: the trip is her first time away from the kids, which is a big deal. She might be anxious about being gone, and the prep adds stress. The husband might not realize how much work meal prepping is. If she agreed to the trip, maybe she should have considered the prep. But if this is a sudden request without prior discussion, he might be adding last-minute stress.\n\nAlso, the husband's solution of making sandwiches is dismissive. The wife's suggestion shows she's trying to be helpful but maybe not in the way he wants. The key is communication. Did they talk about this before? If the husband didn't mention his concerns earlier, he might be in the wrong for not preparing in advance. If he did, and she's still refusing, maybe she's not being supportive.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the request was reasonable and communicated properly, maybe not. But if he didn't consider her workload or stress, then he might be. The answer could hinge on whether the request was made in a considerate way. Since the wife got upset, maybe the husband didn't consider her perspective. Alternatively, she could have said no earlier. It's a bit of a gray area, but leaning towards the husband not being in the wrong since his request is practical, but the way he approached it might be an issue. However, since the user thinks the author is in the wrong, I need to check if there's a clear right answer here. Maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong) because the request is reasonable, but the wife's refusal is also valid. So maybe the husband isn't in the wrong.\n"
