It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away. AITA?\n\ntl;dr My wife is leaving for a week and refuses to food prep\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a husband asking his wife to meal prep before her trip, and she gets upset. The husband's reasoning is that he's worried about cooking for the kids, who are picky, and he's not as confident. The wife feels it's too much work. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The husband is asking for help because he's taking on more responsibilities during her absence. It's his first time alone with the kids, and he's worried about making mistakes. Meal prepping could make things easier for him, especially since his wife knows the kids' preferences better. \n\nOn the other hand, the wife is going on a trip for the first time since the kids were born. She might be stressed or already preparing for the trip, and adding meal prep could be an extra burden. She might feel that the request is unfair, especially if she's already managing a lot. \n\nThe key points here are communication and expectations. The husband's request is reasonable, but maybe he didn't consider her workload. However, he's also trying to prepare for a challenging week. The wife's response seems abrupt, telling him to make sandwiches if it's too hard, which might come off as dismissive. \n\nI think the husband isn't necessarily in the wrong because he's trying to ask for help in a practical way. However, maybe the way he asked wasn't the best, or he didn't check in with her about her capacity. But since the question is whether he's in the wrong, and the wife's reaction is more about the request being too much, the husband's intentions are good. So probably answer B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
