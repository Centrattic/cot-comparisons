She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the husband is in the wrong for asking his wife to meal prep before her trip. \n\nFirst, the situation: The wife is going on a week-long trip, her first time away from the kids since they were born. The husband is worried about handling all the chores and cooking alone. The kids are picky eaters, and the wife is more familiar with their preferences. He asked her to prep meals for the week, but she got upset, saying it's too much work. He thinks it's fair since she's taking time off.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong. Let me consider both sides. \n\nOn the husband's side: He's asking for help to manage the household alone, especially with kids who are hard to please. He's already taking on her chores and wants to avoid stress. Meal prepping could save him time and reduce the risk of kid meltdowns. It's a practical request, given the circumstances.\n\nOn the wife's side: She's going away and might be stressed about the trip. If she's already overwhelmed with her own plans, adding meal prep could be too much. Maybe she feels it's unfair to ask for more when she's already taking time off. Also, she might see the husband as capable of handling it, even if it's different from usual.\n\nIs the husband in the wrong? It depends on communication and understanding. If he approached it as a reasonable request because he knows his limitations, maybe not. But if he's not considering her stress and workload, that's a problem. The key is whether the request was made with consideration for her feelings and workload. The wife's reaction suggests she felt it was an unreasonable additional burden. The husband might not be in the wrong if he genuinely needed help, but maybe he didn't communicate it well or considered her perspective. However, since this is a one-time thing and he's asking for support during her absence, it's a bit of a grey area. \n\nAnother angle: The wife could have offered alternatives, like prepping some meals but not all, or maybe compromising. The husband's demand might come off as expecting her to do all, which isn't fair. But he's also trying to manage a challenging week. \n\nIn terms of fairness, if the wife agreed to leave and take the trip, maybe it's fair to ask for some help with the transition. But if the request was too much, then maybe the husband should have found another solution, like adjusting his expectations. \n\nI think the husband isn't entirely in the wrong because he's preparing for a challenging week. However, he might not have considered how much the request added to his wife's pre-trip workload. The answer might be B (not in the wrong), but there's room for discussion. Alternatively, maybe A if the request was too much. But given that it's a one-time thing and to help him manage, B makes sense.\n"
