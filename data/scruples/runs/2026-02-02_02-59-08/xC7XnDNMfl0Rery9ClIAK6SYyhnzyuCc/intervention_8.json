      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for asking his wife to meal prep before her trip. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the wife is going on a week-long trip, the first time away from the kids since they were born. The husband has to take over her half of the chores, including cooking, which he's not as comfortable with. His kids are picky eaters, and the wife knows their preferences better. He asked her to prep dinners for the week, but she got upset, thinking it's too much work. He's frustrated because he's worried about the kids' meltdowns without their usual food.\n\nSo, the main points are: the husband is asking for help to manage without his wife's usual contributions, but the wife feels the request is too burdensome. The question is whether the husband is in the wrong.\n\nFrom the husband's perspective, he's trying to prepare in a way that makes his week manageable. Since the wife is going away, it's fair to ask her to help before she leaves. But the wife might feel that the request is excessive, especially if she's already preparing for her trip. Maybe she's stressed about the trip itself and doesn't want additional tasks. \n\nBut wait, the husband is asking her to do something before she leaves. If she's going away, it's reasonable to expect her to assist with preparations. The wife's response of \"if it gets too hard, just make sandwiches\" might not address the husband's concern about the kids' picky eating. The husband's argument is that he's not as in tune with their preferences, so prepping meals would prevent issues. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the husband is not considering the wife's workload. If she's preparing for a trip, adding meal prep could be a lot. But the trip is her choice, so expecting her to help before leaving could be fair. \n\nThe key here is whether the request is reasonable. Meal prepping for a week is a lot, but since she's the one who normally cooks, maybe it's part of her role. However, if the wife is already overwhelmed with her own preparations, the husband should consider her limits. \n\nThe husband's intention is to make his week easier, which is understandable. The wife's refusal might be because she's overburdened. The question is if the husband's request was unreasonable. If meal prepping is feasible for her and he made the request in advance, then he's not in the wrong. But if she's already stressed about the trip and the request adds too much, maybe he should have offered to compromise, like prepping just a few meals instead of all. \n\nIn the given scenario, the husband does ask in advance, and the wife's refusal might be valid if it's too much. However, since the meal prep is being done before her trip, it's a valid request for support. The wife's response of suggesting sandwiches might not be helpful if the kids are picky. So maybe the husband isn't in the wrong here. \n\nBut I should also consider societal norms. It's common in many relationships for the partner leaving to help prepare, especially if they usually handle a role. If the husband is taking over responsibilities, it's reasonable to ask for support before the departure. So, the answer might be B, the author is not in the wrong. However, if the request is too much for the wife, maybe there's a middle ground. But the question is about being in the wrong, not about the best solution. Since the author's intent is to prepare and he asked in advance, the answer is B.\n"
