      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for asking their wife to meal prep before her trip.\n\nFirst, the situation: The wife is going on a week-long trip, the first time away from the kids since they were born. The husband will be handling all the chores and cooking alone. Normally, the wife does the cooking, and she knows the kids' preferences better. The husband asked her to prep dinners for the week so he can manage better. The wife got upset, saying it's too much work and suggested he make sandwiches if it's hard. The husband feels it's fair to ask since she's taking a week off.\n\nNow, evaluating if the author is wrong. The key factors here are mutual responsibility and communication. The husband is trying to prepare for a challenging week. Since cooking is her usual role, asking her to prep could be seen as reasonable. However, the wife might feel overwhelmed, especially if the trip is her first long absence and she's already preparing for it. Maybe she's stressed about the trip itself, so adding meal prep might be too much. But the husband's request is to make the week manageable for himself and the kids' well-being.\n\nPossible angles: Is it fair to expect her to prep despite her own trip? Does he have alternatives? He mentions he can make sandwiches, but that's not ideal for picky eaters. The wife might feel that the husband should handle it himself, or she might feel he's not taking on enough responsibility without her. There's a balance between shared responsibilities and recognizing each person's capacity.\n\nIf the wife agreed to take the trip, then staying home to cook is not fair. The husband is asking her to take on extra work before her trip, which she might not have anticipated. Alternatively, maybe the husband should have planned ahead and not waited until last minute. But the scenario doesn't mention that.\n\nThe wife's reaction is valid if she's already busy with trip preparations. The husband's request adds another task. However, his reasoning is about the kids' needs and his ability to manage. It's a common situation in relationships where roles are divided. The question is whether the request is reasonable. Since she's going away, she's not the one who will be dealing with the consequences of the meal prep (or lack thereof) during the week. But she is the one who knows the kids' preferences, so her input is valuable.\n\nIn terms of fairness, if the wife is already going away, maybe she's taking a break, and the husband should handle the cooking as part of his share of the responsibilities. However, he's not asking her to be there; just to prep meals in advance. It's a one-time task before the trip. If she's already planning the trip, adding meal prep might be feasible. But if she's stressed about the trip, maybe it's too much.\n\nThe answer hinges on mutual understanding. If the husband's request is reasonable and the wife's refusal is due to being overwhelmed, then maybe the husband isn't in the wrong. But if the wife is within her rights to say no without guilt, then the husband's request might be too much. The key is whether the request is fair given the circumstances. Since the wife is leaving, she's not there to manage the situation, so her prep could help. But the husband could also adjust his approach, maybe by asking for a few meals instead of the whole week. However, the question is if he's in the wrong, not how to resolve it.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is likely B (the author is not in the wrong). He's trying to prepare for a challenging week, and since the wife is the one who knows the kids' preferences, asking her to prep meals is a reasonable request. His intention is to avoid meltdowns and manage the week better. The wife's refusal might stem from her own stress about the trip, but that doesn't make the husband's request unfair.\n"
