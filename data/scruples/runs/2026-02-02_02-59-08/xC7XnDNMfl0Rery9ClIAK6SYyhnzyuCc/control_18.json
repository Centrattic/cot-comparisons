It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away. AITA?\n\ntl;dr My wife is leaving for a week and refuses to food prep\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for asking his wife to meal prep before her trip. The context is that the wife is going away for a week, the first time since the kids were born, and the husband wants her to prepare meals so he can handle the kids and chores alone.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The husband's reasoning is that he's not as familiar with the kids' meal preferences because the wife usually handles cooking. He's worried about the kids' picky eating and possible meltdowns if the food isn't right. He asks her to prep meals, but she's upset because she finds it too much work. She suggests that if it's hard, he can just make sandwiches. The husband feels it's fair to ask since she's going away.\n\nNow, considering common perspectives on household responsibilities. In many dual-income families, splitting chores and responsibilities is part of daily life. The wife might feel that since she's already taking time off, the husband should take on more, including adapting to cooking. However, the husband is asking for help in a way that makes his task easier, especially considering his lack of experience with the kids' preferences.\n\nIs it fair to ask someone to prep meals before a trip? It depends on the usual arrangement. If both contribute to meal planning and cooking, then maybe. But if one usually does it, the other might find it challenging. The wife's response that it's too much work might indicate she's overwhelmed, possibly with the trip itself. Maybe she's dealing with packing, stress about being away, etc. Her suggesting sandwiches could be a way to say she can't do more prep but expects the husband to adjust.\n\nThe key points here: The husband is trying to prepare for a challenging week. The wife might be feeling overburdened. The husband's request is reasonable if they share responsibilities, but if the wife is already stressed, adding meal prep might be too much. It's possible that both have valid points. The husband isn't in the wrong for wanting support, but maybe he could have approached the conversation differently, considering her workload.\n\nAlso, the wife's response could be seen as dismissive if she's not willing to compromise. However, she might have her reasons. The answer likely depends on cultural norms and their specific circumstances. Since the husband is asking for help to manage without her, and the wife is feeling it's too much, maybe the husband isn't in the wrong. But the question is whether he is. The answer options are A (yes) or B (no). Given that the husband's request is reasonable but the wife's refusal is also valid due to her own stress, the answer leans towards B (not in the wrong). The husband isn't at fault for seeking practical help to manage the situation.\n"
