It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away. AITA?\n\ntl;dr My wife is leaving for a week and refuses to food prep\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The scenario is about a husband asking his wife to meal prep before her trip so he can handle the kids and chores alone. The wife got upset and said it's too much work, suggesting he make sandwiches instead.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband is taking on a big responsibility with the kids and work. He's asking his wife to prep meals so he doesn't have to deal with picky eaters and possible meltdowns. The wife feels it's too much for her to do, especially since she's going on a trip. She's already taking time off to work and manage the kids, so adding meal prep might be overwhelming.\n\nThe key points here are about fairness and understanding each other's workloads. The husband's reasoning is that the wife knows the kids' preferences better, so prepping meals would help him. But the wife is already stressed about the trip and might feel that the husband isn't considering her workload. Meal prepping for a week can be time-consuming and might take away from her ability to prepare for her trip or rest.\n\nAlso, the wife's suggestion to make sandwiches is a compromise, but the husband feels that's not sufficient. However, maybe the wife is trying to reduce her own stress by delegating the cooking. The husband's request might be reasonable, but he needs to acknowledge her feelings and maybe find another solution together, like partial prepping or adjusting the menu.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit situational. The husband isn't entirely wrong for wanting help, but he might not have considered the wife's perspective enough. The wife is also not wrong for feeling it's too much. So, the author's position is asking if he's in the wrong. Since both have valid points, but the husband's approach could be seen as not empathizing with his wife's situation, maybe the answer is A. However, some might argue that it's not wrong to ask for support when needed. But since the wife is already stressed, the husband might need to adjust. I think the answer is A, the author is in the wrong because he didn't consider his wife's workload and feelings adequately.\n"
