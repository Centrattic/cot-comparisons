      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong for wanting their wife to meal prep before her trip. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The wife is going on a week-long trip, her first since the kids were born. The husband has to take over her chores, including cooking, which the wife normally handles. The kids are picky eaters, and the wife knows their preferences better. The husband asked her to pre-make dinners for the week to make things easier for him. The wife got upset, thinking it's too much work, and said if it's too hard, he can just make sandwiches. The husband is worried about the kids' meltdowns if the food isn't right and doesn't think it's unfair to ask.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about fairness and communication. The husband is trying to manage a challenging week (work + kids + chores) and is seeking support. But the wife feels it's an added burden. He's asking her to do something she already does, but she's on a trip. Maybe she's already packing, planning, etc., and feels overwhelmed. But he's asking for help in preparation so he can handle the week.\n\nIs it reasonable to ask her to prep meals? Well, she's going away, so maybe she's not there to do the cooking. But prepping before the trip is a way to help. However, she might feel that it's too much, especially if she's already busy. So the question is whether the husband is overstepping by expecting her to do this, or if it's a reasonable request given the circumstances.\n\nAlso, the wife's response suggests she's not willing to do the meal prep, which might indicate she doesn't find it fair. The husband's argument is that since she's responsible for cooking and the kids are picky, he's not equipped to handle it, so prepping would help. But the wife might feel that the husband should take on more responsibility without her help, especially if this is the first time she's leaving. \n\nI think the issue here is about shared responsibilities and expectations. The husband is trying to plan ahead, but the wife is reacting negatively. Maybe the husband should have discussed this earlier or found a compromise. For example, maybe she can prep some of the meals while she's still around, or they can get frozen meals. But the question is whether the husband is in the wrong. \n\nIf the wife is already taking the trip, which is a significant responsibility, asking her to prep meals might add to her stress. However, the husband's request is to make his own week easier. It's a matter of balancing both partners' workloads. \n\nThe answer might depend on their usual dynamics. If the wife always does the cooking and the husband is now stepping in, but the kids are too picky for him, it's understandable he wants help. However, if the wife feels she's already stretched thin with the trip, then maybe the husband's request is too much. \n\nBut the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The author's reasoning is that he's asking her to do what she already does, but prepped in advance. The wife's reaction is that it's too much work. So the author might not be in the wrong, but the situation could be a communication issue. The author might need to consider the wife's perspective better. Maybe the answer is B (No), but with some nuance. Alternatively, if the author didn't consider her workload, maybe A (Yes). \n\nI think the main point is that the husband is trying to prepare, and the wife is pushing back. But the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because he's trying to manage a difficult situation. However, maybe the approach could be better. The question is whether the author is in the wrong, not whether he handled it perfectly. The answer is likely B (No), but I need to be careful. \n\nAnother angle: The wife's argument that if it's too hard, he can make sandwiches. That might imply she's not supportive of the meal prep idea and wants him to take responsibility. The husband is asking for help, which is reasonable. If the wife is unwilling to help, it's her responsibility, so the author isn't in the wrong. So I think the answer is B.\n"
