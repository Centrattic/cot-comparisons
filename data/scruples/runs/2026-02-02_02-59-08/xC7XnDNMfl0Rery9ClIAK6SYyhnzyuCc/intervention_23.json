It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation is that the husband wants his wife to meal prep before her trip, but she gets upset and refuses.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The wife is going on her first trip away from the kids, and the husband is asking her to prepare meals so he can manage during the week. He's worried about the kids' picky eating and not having the right food. The wife feels it's too much work and suggests sandwiches instead.\n\nThe husband's reasoning is that since the wife usually handles cooking and knows the kids' preferences better, this would make things easier. He also mentions that this is her first time away, so he's asking before she leaves. The wife's response is that it's too much work and she's upset about it.\n\nNow, considering fairness. The husband is trying to make life easier during the week he's alone with the kids. It's reasonable to ask for help, especially since the wife is responsible for cooking. But maybe he's not considering her workload or stress before the trip. Meal prepping can be time-consuming and might add to her stress, especially if she's already preparing for a trip. She might have her own things to handle, like packing, planning, etc. So, while his request comes from a place of wanting to avoid a mess, he's not considering her current capacity. The wife's response might be valid because she's overwhelmed. \n\nIs the husband in the wrong? It depends on context. If he's aware that she's busy with the trip and still insists, that could be unfair. But if he's just trying to help and she's being unreasonable, maybe not. But given that she's upset and says it's too much work, he might have overstepped. The key here is communication. Maybe he should have discussed it earlier and found a middle ground. So, I think the answer is A (author is in the wrong) because he's not considering her perspective and workload.\n"
