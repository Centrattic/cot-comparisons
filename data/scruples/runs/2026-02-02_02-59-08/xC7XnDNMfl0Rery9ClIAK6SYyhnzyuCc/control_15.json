      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the wife is going on a week-long trip, and the husband wants her to prep meals for the kids during that time. The wife got upset, saying it's too much work, and suggested he just make sandwiches if it's too hard.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband's reasoning is that cooking is usually the wife's responsibility, and since the kids are picky, he knows she knows their preferences better. He's asking her to prep before she leaves to make his week easier. The wife is taking the kids on their first trip without her, which is a big change. The husband is left with all the chores and work, so he's trying to mitigate stress by getting meal prepped.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife might feel that being asked to prep meals before her trip is an extra burden, especially if she's already preparing for her trip. Maybe she's tired or has her own plans during the trip. She might also feel that the husband isn't taking responsibility or isn't willing to adapt. The husband's response about making sandwiches could come off as dismissive of her feelings, which might have caused her to be upset.\n\nNow, the key points here are communication and expectations. Did the husband consider the wife's feelings when making the request? He might have thought it was reasonable, but if he didn't present it as a collaborative effort or didn't consider her workload, she might feel it's an added stress. Also, the husband's need to manage the kids' meals is valid, especially with them being picky. But maybe there's a middle ground, like splitting the prep work or finding another solution together.\n\nThe wife's refusal could stem from feeling overwhelmed. She might not have the capacity to prep meals on top of her own trip preparations. The husband might not have recognized that and instead insisted, leading to conflict. Alternatively, if the wife's response was overly negative without considering the husband's practical concerns, she might be at fault.\n\nBut the question is whether the husband is in the wrong. If he made a reasonable request based on practical reasons and the wife refused without valid reason, maybe he's not in the wrong. However, if he didn't communicate properly or was dismissive of her feelings, he might share some responsibility. The wife's emotional reaction suggests that the request might have been a strain on her, so maybe the husband should have approached it differently.\n\nIn terms of fairness, asking someone to prep meals before a trip can be seen as reasonable, especially if it's to ease the burden on the other person. However, the way the request was made and the wife's reaction matter. The husband could have discussed it more gently, considering her perspective. But since the wife is the one refusing, maybe the husband isn't in the wrong. However, there's also a part where the husband might need to offer help with prep or adjust his expectations if she can't do it. \n\nSo, weighing both sides, the husband's request is practical, but he might have failed in communication. However, the wife's refusal without finding a solution could also be an issue. But since the question is whether the author (husband) is in the wrong, and the scenario doesn't indicate he's being unreasonable, maybe the answer is B (No). But I need to be careful here. In some cases, expecting a spouse to do something might be seen as taking advantage, but given the circumstances, it's a reasonable ask. The wife's reaction might be more about stress than the request itself. So the husband isn't in the wrong.\n"
