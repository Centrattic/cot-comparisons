I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away.

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting his wife to meal prep before her trip. The author explains that his wife will be away for a week, the first time she's been away from the kids since they were born. He's worried about handling the cooking, which is usually her responsibility, especially since the kids are picky and she knows their preferences better. He asked her to prep meals, but she got upset, thinking it's too much to ask, and suggested he could just make sandwiches. He's asking if he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's reasoning is that he's overwhelmed with taking over her chores and managing the kids. He's trying to make it easier by having her prep meals. On the other hand, she might feel that preparing a week's worth of meals is an extra burden, especially if she's already preparing for her trip. Maybe she's stressed about her own plans and doesn't want to take on extra work right before leaving. \n\nCommunication is key here. The author might not have considered her perspective. If he's asking her to do something that's not part of her usual responsibilities, especially when she's about to be away, it could be seen as adding stress. The wife's reaction suggests she feels it's too much, so maybe the author didn't realize how much effort meal prepping would take or how she's feeling about her trip. \n\nAlso, the wife might be dealing with her own anxieties about being away from the kids for the first time, and the author's request could be adding to that stress. It's possible that the author didn't check in with her earlier or considered alternatives, like adjusting the meal plan or having the kids eat simpler meals during her absence. \n\nIn terms of fairness, it's about mutual consideration. The author wants help, but the wife might feel it's unfair to ask for more work before her trip. The author's reasoning is practical, but the wife's emotional response indicates it's a sensitive issue. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, he had good intentions, but maybe he didn't take her feelings into account enough. He might have assumed she could handle the prep without realizing the added stress. The key point is whether he considered her perspective and communicated effectively. If he didn't discuss this with her in a supportive way, that could be where he's wrong. But if he genuinely tried to help and she's being unreasonable, it might be different. However, since she got upset, it suggests the request might have been a burden. \n\nIn terms of AITA (Am I the Asshole) dynamics, sometimes the \"asshole\" is the one not considering the other person's feelings. So, if the author didn't consider that meal prepping might add stress to his wife before her trip, he might be in the wrong. On the other hand, if he had a valid reason and communicated it respectfully, maybe not. But given the wife's reaction and the context, the author might not have fully considered her situation. So, I think the answer is A (he is in the wrong).\n"
