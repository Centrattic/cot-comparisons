It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person (the husband) is in the wrong for asking his wife to meal prep before her trip. So the situation is that the wife is going away for a week, and the husband is handling all the chores and cooking. Since the kids are picky and the wife knows their preferences better, he wants her to prep the meals. She's upset because she thinks it's too much work, suggesting sandwiches instead.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the roles they've established. Cooking is the wife's responsibility, and she's more familiar with the kids' tastes. The husband is concerned about managing everything on his own, especially since it's the first time he's doing so without her. He's asking her to pre-plan meals to make his week easier, which is a reasonable request given their usual setup. \n\nBut the wife is upset, which might be because she's already preparing for her trip, which can be stressful. Maybe she feels overwhelmed and thinks asking her to prep meals adds to her workload. However, the husband's request is to have the meals prepped before she leaves, so she's not doing it during her trip. \n\nThe key points here are mutual understanding and communication. The husband is trying to set himself up for success by having the meals ready, which makes sense. The wife, on the other hand, might feel he's not considering her stress. But the husband isn't asking her to do the cooking while she's away; he's asking her to plan and prep in advance. \n\nIs it unfair? Well, since she's going on a trip, she's already planning and packing. Adding meal prep could be an extra task, but it's a one-time effort that benefits both the kids and the husband. If the wife is overwhelmed, maybe they need to discuss priorities. However, the husband's request is practical and fair given their circumstances. The wife's response to suggest sandwiches instead might not be the best solution if the kids are picky, but that's her way of trying to reduce her own workload. \n\nIn terms of fairness, the husband is asking for help that he's entitled to, considering their shared responsibilities. He's acknowledging his own limitations and seeking support. The wife's refusal could be due to different reasons, but that doesn't necessarily make the husband wrong. He's not being unreasonable; he's trying to manage a challenging week ahead. \n\nSo, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong). The request is reasonable, and he's trying to prepare for a new responsibility. The wife's reaction might stem from stress, but that doesn't mean the husband is at fault here.\n"
