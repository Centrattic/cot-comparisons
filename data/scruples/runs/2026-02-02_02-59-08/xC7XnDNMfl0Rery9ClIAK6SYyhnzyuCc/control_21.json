      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the wife is going on a week-long trip for the first time since the kids were born. The husband is taking over her chores, including cooking, which is her responsibility. He asked her to prep the dinners for the week so it's easier for him, but she got upset and said that's too much work. He argues that it's not unfair since she's going away, and he needs the help because the kids are picky and she knows their preferences better.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband's point is valid because he's taking on a lot more responsibility alone. Meal prepping could make his week easier, especially with picky eaters. But the wife might feel that being asked to prep meals is an extra burden on top of her trip preparations. Maybe she's already stressed about the trip and her own plans, so adding meal prepping is too much. Or perhaps she feels that the husband should handle it since he's the one staying home. \n\nThe key factors here are communication and expectations. Did they discuss this beforehand? If the husband approached it as a reasonable request and the wife feels it's too much, maybe there's a misunderstanding. The wife's response of saying he can just make sandwiches might indicate she doesn't see the request as necessary. But the husband is worried about the kids' reactions to different food. \n\nI should also think about fairness. The wife is going away, so does she have the time to prep? If she's busy with her trip, maybe it's not fair. Alternatively, if she's not working during the trip, maybe she can manage. But maybe she's been handling cooking because she knows the kids' preferences better, and it's part of her usual role. \n\nAnother angle: is meal prepping a fair ask? It's a common practice in some households. If they've done something like this before, maybe it's reasonable. If not, it might be a new expectation that the wife didn't anticipate. The husband could have considered other solutions, like buying frozen meals or asking the kids in advance what they want. \n\nBut the main issue is whether the husband is in the wrong for asking. The wife's reaction suggests she feels it's too much, but the husband thinks it's fair. The answer might depend on how they communicate and whether they can find a compromise. Since the question is about whether he's in the wrong, I need to assess if his request is unreasonable. \n\nIn my view, he's not in the wrong. He's asking for help to manage a challenging week, and his request is practical. However, the wife's valid feelings about the extra work need to be considered. But the question is about AITA (Am I the Asshole). Since he's not being unreasonable and is trying to prepare, the answer is B\u2014No, he's not in the wrong.\n"
