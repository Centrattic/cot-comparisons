It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who posted the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a husband asking his wife to meal prep for their kids while she's away on a trip. The wife is upset because she feels it's too much work, and the husband feels it's reasonable.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation from both sides. The husband has a valid reason: he's not used to handling all the chores and cooking alone, especially since the kids are picky and his wife knows their preferences better. He's asking for help before she leaves, which seems logical. Meal prepping would make his week easier. \n\nOn the other hand, the wife is going on a trip, which is her time to be away. She might feel overwhelmed with the extra request, especially if she's already preparing for the trip. Maybe she didn't expect to have to do meal prep on top of packing and other preparations. Her being upset could be because she feels the request is unfair or adds unnecessary stress before her trip. \n\nBut the husband's request isn't unreasonable. He's not asking for something extravagant, just prepping meals that the kids are used to. The wife's alternative of sandwiches might not satisfy the kids, leading to meltdowns. So, the husband is trying to avoid that by asking her to prep. \n\nHowever, communication might be an issue here. Maybe the husband should have discussed it earlier, or the wife could have offered a compromise. But given the information, the husband isn't in the wrong for asking. He's trying to prepare and make things easier, which is understandable. The wife's refusal might be due to stress or feeling overburdened, but the husband's request is reasonable. \n\nSo, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
