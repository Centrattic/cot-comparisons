It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for asking his wife to meal prep before her trip. The wife is going away for a week, and he's worried about handling the kids and chores alone. Cooking is her responsibility, and he wants her to prep meals because he's not as confident in his cooking skills, especially since the kids are picky. She got upset and said that's too much work, suggesting he can just make sandwiches.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's reasoning is that he's taking over her half of the chores, and since she's better at cooking, it's easier for her to prep. He's trying to avoid meltdowns from the kids not getting their usual food. On the other hand, the wife is taking a trip for the first time since the kids were born, which is a significant event. She might feel that the request is adding extra work before her trip, especially if she's already preparing for it. Maybe she's stressed about the trip, and the meal prep is an additional burden.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key points here are communication and mutual understanding. The author is trying to manage his responsibilities, but he's making an assumption that the wife can handle the prep. However, he might not have considered her perspective. Maybe she's already overwhelmed with her own preparations for the trip and doesn't have the capacity to do meal prep. Alternatively, he might not have discussed it in a way that acknowledges her efforts, leading to her feeling upset.\n\nIn relationships, it's important to consider each other's workloads and communicate effectively. The author's request might seem reasonable from his point of view, but if he didn't check in with her about her current situation or offer alternatives, that could be where the issue lies. The wife's response suggests that she feels the request is too much, possibly because she's already planning to go away and might not see the meal prep as part of her trip prep. She might also feel that the author isn't taking responsibility for his own part, hence the suggestion about sandwiches.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, he's not unreasonable in needing help, but perhaps he didn't approach the conversation in a way that was considerate of his wife's situation. The problem might be more about how he framed the request rather than the request itself. If he had approached it as a collaborative effort to find a solution that works for both of them, maybe she wouldn't have gotten upset. The fact that she suggested sandwiches as an alternative might indicate she's trying to be helpful, but he dismissed that by saying he doesn't want the meltdowns.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't entirely in the wrong because he's trying to manage his responsibilities, but he could have handled the conversation better. The main issue is communication and mutual consideration of each other's workloads. However, since the question is whether he's in the wrong, and considering the wife's valid reaction, maybe the answer leans towards him not being in the wrong, but there's room for improvement. But given the options, the answer is B (No), because he isn't in the wrong, but the situation could use better communication.\n"
