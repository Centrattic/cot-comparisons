On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking his wife to meal prep before her trip.\n\nFirst, the situation: The wife is going on a week-long trip for the first time since having kids. The husband is handling everything alone, including chores and cooking. The kids are picky eaters, and the wife knows their preferences better. He asked her to prep dinners for the week. She got upset, saying it's too much work, and suggested he can just do sandwiches if needed.\n\nNow, the author wants to know if he's in the wrong. The user thinks he is, but wants my opinion.\n\nHmm. Let's break it down. The husband is asking for help to make things easier for himself during a stressful time. He's taking on a lot with the kids and work. But the wife is going away, which is a big deal for both of them. She might be stressed about the trip or the logistics of the trip itself. Maybe she's already doing a lot and feels that prepping meals is an additional burden. She might be overwhelmed with her own travel plans and not want to take on extra work right before leaving.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband is trying to prepare to manage without her. He's not asking for something unreasonable, like a huge meal plan every day, but just to prep dinners. But maybe the timing is bad. If she's already busy with her own preparations, adding meal prep could be too much. Also, the fact that she's upset suggests that the request might not have been communicated in a way that considered her perspective. He might have assumed she could do it without considering the added stress of her trip.\n\nIs it fair to ask? Well, the husband is in a tough spot. He's asking for help to manage the kids' meals, which are picky. But the wife might feel that the request is imposing. The key here is communication. If the husband had considered that she might be overwhelmed with her trip, maybe he should have offered to handle it himself or found another solution. Alternatively, if she had communicated her own stresses, maybe they could have found a middle ground.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. He's trying to plan ahead, which is understandable. But he might not have considered the additional burden on his wife, who's already preparing for a trip. The wife's reaction is valid because she might feel the request is unrealistic given her own circumstances. However, the husband's intention is to reduce stress for himself, which is also reasonable. The problem might be in the communication and mutual understanding.\n\nBut overall, since the wife is going away and might be dealing with her own travel stress, asking her to prep meals on top of her trip preparations might be too much. Therefore, the husband might be in the right to want help, but the way he asked or the timing could be an issue. However, the wife's refusal is also valid because she's under pressure. So maybe the answer is B (he's not in the wrong) because he's trying to manage his responsibilities, but the situation requires more consideration from both sides. Wait, but the user's own thought is that the author is in the wrong. Hmm. Maybe the husband didn't consider the wife's workload and her stress from the trip. So he's not entirely in the wrong, but there's room for improvement in communication. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. If the wife is already stressed, maybe he shouldn't add to her workload. Therefore, he might be in the wrong for not considering her situation. But I'm not sure. It's a tough call. I think the answer could be either way, but given the context, maybe B is correct because he's asking for help to manage his responsibilities, which is reasonable. However, the wife's response is also valid. So the answer might be B (he's not in the wrong) because he's trying to plan, but the wife's perspective is also important. But the user thinks he is in the wrong. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe he's in the right to ask, but the wife's refusal is also valid. So perhaps the answer is B. But I'm not 100% sure. Maybe it's a mutual misunderstanding. But the question is specifically about whether the author is in the wrong. If the wife is taking a trip, she's the one leaving, so maybe it's fair to ask her to prepare before leaving. But if she's already preparing for the trip, adding meal prep could be too much. So maybe the answer is A (he is in the wrong) because he didn't consider her workload. But I'm not entirely sure. I think it's a bit of both, but the question wants a clear answer. Given the information, I think the answer is B (he's not in the wrong) because he's trying to manage the situation, which is understandable. However, the wife's feelings are also valid. But according to the user's initial thought, they think the author is in the wrong. Maybe the answer is A. Hmm. This is tricky. I'll go with B, but I'm not entirely confident.\n"
