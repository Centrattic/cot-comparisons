It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking his wife to meal prep before her trip. The situation is that the wife is going away for a week, and the husband wants her to prepare dinners so he can handle the kids and chores without her. The wife is upset and thinks it's too much work, offering to make sandwiches instead.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband's reasoning is that he's taking over her responsibilities, especially with the kids who are picky eaters. He knows the wife cooks better because she's done it more. Meal prepping would help him avoid meltdowns from the kids not getting their usual food. He's asking this because he's going to be managing everything alone for the first time, which is a lot.\n\nOn the wife's side, she might be feeling overwhelmed by the request. A week of prepping meals is a significant task, especially if she's already preparing for her trip. Traveling might have its own stressors, so adding meal prepping could be too much. She suggests sandwiches as an alternative, which is a simpler option. Her reaction might stem from feeling that the request is unfair or not considering her workload.\n\nNow, the question is whether the husband is in the wrong. Is it reasonable to expect his wife to meal prep when she's going on a trip? Meal prepping can be time-consuming and stressful, especially if the trip is their first time apart. The husband's intention is to make things easier for himself, but he's not considering his wife's possible stress or time constraints. The wife's response indicates that she finds the request burdensome, which could mean the husband didn't communicate effectively or consider her perspective.\n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual consideration. The husband might not realize how much work meal prepping is, especially for a week. He assumes she can handle it, but she might have other priorities. It's also important to note that the wife is the one going away, so the husband is staying with the kids. While it's understandable he wants help, he should respect her limits. The fact that she offered an alternative (sandwiches) shows she's trying to compromise, but he might be dismissing that.\n\nIn terms of fairness, asking someone to prepare a week's worth of meals before a trip could be seen as a burden, especially if they're already dealing with their own travel preparations. The husband might be overestimating his own ability to handle the cooking and underestimating his wife's workload. The wife's reaction is valid because it's a lot to ask, and she's trying to balance her own needs with his.\n\nTherefore, the husband might be in the wrong because he didn't consider his wife's perspective and the feasibility of the request. The answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
