It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away. AITA?\n\ntl;dr My wife is leaving for a week and refuses to food prep\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the wife is going away for a week, and the husband wants her to meal prep because he's not confident in cooking for the kids, who are picky. The wife got upset and said it's too much work, suggesting he just make sandwiches if it gets too hard.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband's perspective is that he's worried about managing alone with the kids and work, and he's asking for help to avoid meltdowns. The wife's reaction is that meal prepping is too much on top of her trip prep. So, am I the asshole?\n\nThe husband's request is reasonable because he's preparing for his own situation. Meal prep could save him time and stress. However, the wife might feel that the request is adding extra work, especially since she's already dealing with her own trip preparations. It's possible she's overwhelmed, which is why she reacted negatively. \n\nBut the husband isn't asking her to do something unreasonable during her trip. He's asking her to do it before she leaves. The wife is responsible for cooking normally, so having her prep meals before she goes could be seen as a fair request. The husband isn't trying to make her do her job while she's away, just prepare in advance to ease his burden. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the wife feels that the husband should be more capable of handling the cooking, or that meal prepping isn't fair. It depends on their usual dynamics. If the wife usually handles cooking and they've never discussed changing that, maybe the husband should have considered learning or compromising. However, the husband is upfront about his concerns and is asking for help, which seems legitimate.\n\nThe wife's response might be a bit over the top. If the husband's request is reasonable and the wife is capable of doing the prep, then she might be overreacting. Alternatively, maybe the prep is too much, but that's subjective. The key is whether the request is fair. Since the husband is asking for help to manage his own situation and not making her do anything during her trip, it's probably not his fault. The wife's reaction is more about stress or not wanting the extra work. So the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
