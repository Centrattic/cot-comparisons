I'm not at all and she goes every now and then, mostly on xmas and easter. Her family has always been really religious though and she did go to church with them alot when they wanted her to.\n\nHer dad died a couple months ago and it's something that she's been trying to get a handle on. I'm there for her and want to be there for her...at least until she asked me to go to church with her on Easter. Apparently she went on easter with her family every year. She can't fly home for Easter this year and asked me if I could go with her to church. I said no because one, I don't want to sit through the entire service, and two, I don't believe in any of that stuff. I told her that we don't even need to go now seeing as she's not all that religious. It turned into a huge fight about \"traditions\" and now she's crying and sulking. Look, I feel bad, but I just don't see the point. She even said she doesn't really want to go. Am I wrong for not bending my beliefs and refusing church?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not going to church with their girlfriend after her dad died.\n\nSo, the GF's family is religious. They went to church a lot when they wanted her to. The GF isn't super religious now but still does some holidays. Her dad died a few months ago, and she's trying to cope. The author isn't religious at all. The GF asked him to go to Easter church with the family, but he refused because he doesn't believe and doesn't want to sit through it. The GF was upset, even though she said she didn't really want to go.\n\nHmm. The author says they both aren't very religious, but the GF's family is. The GF is dealing with grief, and maybe this church service was a way for her to connect with family traditions or find comfort. Even if she doesn't believe now, maybe it's important for her to honor her dad or her family's customs. The author's refusal might come off as dismissive of her family's wishes or her emotional needs during a tough time. \n\nBut on the other hand, the author might feel that it's important to be honest about his beliefs and not pretend to go along with something he doesn't believe in. The GF said she didn't want to go, so maybe the author thought it wasn't necessary. However, the GF might have felt that going was a gesture of support for her, even if she wasn't going for religious reasons. \n\nThe key points are about support during grief and respect for traditions. If the GF found comfort in these traditions and the author is her partner, maybe showing up, even without belief, is about being there for her emotionally. The author's refusal might have been seen as not prioritizing her emotional needs over his own beliefs. \n\nBut then again, if the GF isn't religious either and said she doesn't want to go, maybe the author is right to question the necessity. However, the context is after her dad's death. Maybe the family's request was more about honoring him or their tradition, and the GF wanted to do that for her family, even if she's not into it. \n\nI think the author's intention was to be honest, but the action of not going might have hurt the GF and her family. Even if he doesn't believe, showing up could be a gesture of solidarity. The GF's reaction suggests it was important, so maybe the author was wrong not to go. But if the GF herself wasn't committed to going, then maybe the author is in the right. \n\nWait, the GF did say she doesn't really want to go, but maybe the author isn't considering that she might still want to for her family's sake, even if she doesn't personally. The author might be dismissing the importance of family support in her grieving process. \n\nI think the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because even if he isn't religious, supporting his partner during her time of need, especially in a way that her family values, is important. The author's refusal might have disregarded her emotional needs and family's significance, leading to conflict. He could have gone to show support, even if he didn't participate religiously. So, he's in the wrong.\n"
