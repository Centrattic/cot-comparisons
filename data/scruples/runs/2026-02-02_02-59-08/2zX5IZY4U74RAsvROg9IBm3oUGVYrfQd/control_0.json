I'm not at all and she goes every now and then, mostly on xmas and easter. Her family has always been really religious though and she did go to church with them alot when they wanted her to.\n\nHer dad died a couple months ago and it's something that she's been trying to get a handle on. I'm there for her and want to be there for her...at least until she asked me to go to church with her on Easter. Apparently she went on easter with her family every year. She can't fly home for Easter this year and asked me if I could go with her to church. I said no because one, I don't want to sit through the entire service, and two, I don't believe in any of that stuff. I told her that we don't even need to go now seeing as she's not all that religious. It turned into a huge fight about \"traditions\" and now she's crying and sulking. Look, I feel bad, but I just don't see the point. She even said she doesn't really want to go. Am I wrong for not bending my beliefs and refusing church?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not going to church with their girlfriend after her father died. The girlfriend's family is religious, and they went to church every Easter, including last year. The author isn't religious and doesn't want to go, even though the girlfriend occasionally attends but isn't very religious herself.\n\nFirst, the key points: the girlfriend is dealing with grief from her father's death. She asked the author to go to church with her on Easter, probably as a way to cope or honor her dad's memory. The author refused, citing that they don't want to sit through the service and don't believe in religion. The girlfriend was upset, even though she said she didn't really want to go either.\n\nSo, the question is about whether the author's refusal is wrong. From an emotional support perspective, sometimes people in grief seek comfort through traditions, even if they don't feel deeply religious. The author might have thought they were being honest about their beliefs, but the girlfriend might have felt abandoned during a vulnerable time. The conflict here is between personal beliefs and emotional support for a partner.\n\nThe author argues that the girlfriend isn't that religious, so why go? But the girlfriend might see it as a family tradition or a way to connect with her late father. The author's refusal could be seen as not respecting her emotional needs during this time. However, the author also has the right to their own beliefs and may feel uncomfortable in a religious setting.\n\nBut when someone is grieving, showing up for them\u2014even just being present\u2014can be important. The author might not have considered how their refusal could affect the girlfriend's feelings of support. Even if the girlfriend isn't religious, the act of going together might have been about solidarity rather than the religious aspect itself.\n\nOn the other hand, the author isn't wrong to set boundaries regarding their own beliefs. The problem might be in the way the refusal was communicated or the lack of alternative support offered. The author says they want to be there for her, but the refusal could be seen as not following through on that.\n\nSo, balancing respect for the author's values and the girlfriend's emotional needs is tricky. The author might be in the wrong if their refusal hurt the girlfriend's feelings during a difficult time, especially if they didn't offer another way to support her. However, if the author's refusal was honest and they provided other forms of support, maybe they aren't in the wrong. But since the girlfriend was upset and the author didn't compromise, it leans toward the author being in the wrong.\n"
