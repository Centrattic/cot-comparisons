I'm not at all and she goes every now and then, mostly on xmas and easter. Her family has always been really religious though and she did go to church with them alot when they wanted her to.\n\nHer dad died a couple months ago and it's something that she's been trying to get a handle on. I'm there for her and want to be there for her...at least until she asked me to go to church with her on Easter. Apparently she went on easter with her family every year. She can't fly home for Easter this year and asked me if I could go with her to church. I said no because one, I don't want to sit through the entire service, and two, I don't believe in any of that stuff. I told her that we don't even need to go now seeing as she's not all that religious. It turned into a huge fight about \"traditions\" and now she's crying and sulking. Look, I feel bad, but I just don't see the point. She even said she doesn't really want to go. Am I wrong for not bending my beliefs and refusing church?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not going to church with his girlfriend after her dad died. The situation is that neither of them is very religious. The girlfriend sometimes goes on big holidays like Christmas and Easter, especially when her family expects it. Her dad passed away a few months ago, and she wanted to go to church on Easter this year because it's a tradition. The author refused because he's not religious and doesn't want to sit through the service. Now they're fighting, and she's upset.\n\nHmm, so the main points here are about respecting traditions and being there for someone during their grieving process. The author is non-religious and doesn't believe in the church stuff, which is understandable. But the girlfriend might be using the church as a way to find comfort or connect with her family's traditions after her father's death. Even if she says she doesn't really want to go, maybe the act of going is important to her for emotional reasons.\n\nThe author might think that since they're both not religious, there's no point in going. But in a relationship, supporting each other through significant life events, even if they're not personal to you, is often expected. The girlfriend could feel that the author isn't making an effort to be there for her during a hard time. Even if the author's reasons are valid, the refusal might come off as dismissive of her feelings or the importance of the tradition to her family.\n\nHowever, the author's perspective is that he doesn't want to pretend to believe in something he doesn't. That's a legitimate point too. People should be honest about their beliefs. But maybe there's a middle ground, like attending the service for her sake even if he doesn't engage in the religious aspects. It's about showing support rather than participating in the faith.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the girlfriend needed the support and the author's refusal hurt her feelings, then maybe he is. On the other hand, if the author isn't religious and didn't force her to go, perhaps he's not. The key here is the girlfriend's emotional state. After a loss, people often rely on their support systems, and traditions can be a part of that. The author might be wrong for not considering that attending the church service could be a meaningful way for her to cope, even if he personally doesn't find it necessary.\n\nSo, the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong because he didn't support his girlfriend during her time of need, even though they share the same beliefs. The effort to show up and support her might be more important than the actual participation in the religious service.\n"
