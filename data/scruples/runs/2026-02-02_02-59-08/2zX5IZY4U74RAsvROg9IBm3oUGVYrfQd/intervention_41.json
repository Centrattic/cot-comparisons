I'm not at all and she goes every now and then, mostly on xmas and easter. Her family has always been really religious though and she did go to church with them alot when they wanted her to.\n\nHer dad died a couple months ago and it's something that she's been trying to get a handle on. I'm there for her and want to be there for her...at least until she asked me to go to church with her on Easter. Apparently she went on easter with her family every year. She can't fly home for Easter this year and asked me if I could go with her to church. I said no because one, I don't want to sit through the entire service, and two, I don't believe in any of that stuff. I told her that we don't even need to go now seeing as she's not all that religious. It turned into a huge fight about \"traditions\" and now she's crying and sulking. Look, I feel bad, but I just don't see the point. She even said she doesn't really want to go. Am I wrong for not bending my beliefs and refusing church?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for not going to church with his girlfriend after her dad died. The situation is that neither he nor his girlfriend are very religious. She goes sometimes for big holidays like Christmas and Easter. Her family is religious, so she used to go with them when they wanted her to.\n\nHer dad died a few months ago, and she's trying to cope. The author is supportive but refused to go to church with her on Easter this year. He mentioned he doesn't want to sit through the service and doesn't believe in religion. He also said they don't need to go since she's not very religious. This led to a big argument about traditions, and now she's upset.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to consider both sides. The author's position is that he's being honest about his beliefs and preferences. He's not religious and doesn't see the point. On the other hand, the girlfriend might see attending church as important for her family traditions and her emotional healing after her father's death. Even though she says she doesn't really want to go, maybe she still values the gesture of her partner going with her for support.\n\nThe key points here are communication and empathy. The author might not realize how important this gesture is for her, even if she's not religious. By refusing, he might be dismissing her emotional needs. The fact that she's from a religious family and has a history of attending church with them could mean that this is a significant tradition for her. Even if she's not religious now, the act of going together could be a way to honor her dad or support her family's expectations during a grieving period.\n\nThe author's reasoning is about his own beliefs and preferences, but in a relationship, sometimes you need to compromise, especially when it's about supporting a partner through a tough time. The fact that she's crying and sulking suggests that this was hurtful to her. The author might be right in being true to himself, but maybe he could have found a middle ground, like going to a different event or showing support in another way if church wasn't possible. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. If the refusal was without consideration of her feelings, then yes. If he's being honest but not considering her emotional state, then it's a gray area.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, supporting a partner through grief is often seen as important. Even if the activity isn't meaningful to the partner, showing up for the other person can be crucial. The author might not see the value in the tradition, but his girlfriend might see the gesture as important for her coping. So, the answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because he refused without fully understanding her emotional needs. However, there's also the argument that he's being honest about his beliefs, which is valid. But given the context of her grief and the importance of traditions in her family, the answer could be A.\n"
