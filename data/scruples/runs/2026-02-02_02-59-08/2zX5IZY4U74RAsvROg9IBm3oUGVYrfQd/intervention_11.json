I'm not at all and she goes every now and then, mostly on xmas and easter. Her family has always been really religious though and she did go to church with them alot when they wanted her to.\n\nHer dad died a couple months ago and it's something that she's been trying to get a handle on. I'm there for her and want to be there for her...at least until she asked me to go to church with her on Easter. Apparently she went on easter with her family every year. She can't fly home for Easter this year and asked me if I could go with her to church. I said no because one, I don't want to sit through the entire service, and two, I don't believe in any of that stuff. I told her that we don't even need to go now seeing as she's not all that religious. It turned into a huge fight about \"traditions\" and now she's crying and sulking. Look, I feel bad, but I just don't see the point. She even said she doesn't really want to go. Am I wrong for not bending my beliefs and refusing church?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for not going to church with their girlfriend after her dad died.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. Both the author and his girlfriend are not very religious. The girlfriend's family is religious, and she used to go to church with them on holidays like Christmas and Easter. Her dad passed away a few months ago, and she's trying to cope. She asked him to go to church with her on Easter because it was a tradition her family had every year. He refused because he's not religious and didn't want to sit through the service. She got upset, and now they're fighting.\n\nThe author is defending his position by saying he's not religious, doesn't believe in the stuff, and that she even said she doesn't really want to go. He feels bad but doesn't see the point. The user thinks the author is wrong, but wants to know my take.\n\nHmm. On one hand, the author is being honest about his beliefs and not wanting to participate in something he's uncomfortable with. That's valid. People have the right to hold their own beliefs and not pretend otherwise. But on the other hand, the girlfriend is in a vulnerable state after her father's death, and this request might be about emotional support rather than just the religious aspect. Even if she's not religious now, the tradition might be important to her for closure or family reasons.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? Well, refusing to participate in a significant family tradition that's important to her during a time of grief could be seen as dismissive of her needs. Even if he doesn't share her beliefs, showing support in other ways might be more important. The fact that she's upset and sulking suggests that his refusal hurt her feelings, even if he thought he was being truthful.\n\nBut the author also has his own boundaries. Maybe there's a middle ground, like attending a different religious service, or being present in some way that's respectful without going to church. However, the key point is that the girlfriend wanted to go because of tradition, and the author didn't want to comply. If he's not willing to meet her halfway, that could be where the issue lies.\n\nI think it's a balance between respecting his beliefs and considering her emotional needs. Since he's her partner, supporting her through her grief is important. Even if he's not religious, his presence could be symbolic of support. Refusing outright without trying to find an alternative might be where he's wrong. So I lean towards A, the author is in the wrong because he didn't consider her emotional needs as much as his own beliefs.\n"
