I'm not at all and she goes every now and then, mostly on xmas and easter. Her family has always been really religious though and she did go to church with them alot when they wanted her to.\n\nHer dad died a couple months ago and it's something that she's been trying to get a handle on. I'm there for her and want to be there for her...at least until she asked me to go to church with her on Easter. Apparently she went on easter with her family every year. She can't fly home for Easter this year and asked me if I could go with her to church. I said no because one, I don't want to sit through the entire service, and two, I don't believe in any of that stuff. I told her that we don't even need to go now seeing as she's not all that religious. It turned into a huge fight about \"traditions\" and now she's crying and sulking. Look, I feel bad, but I just don't see the point. She even said she doesn't really want to go. Am I wrong for not bending my beliefs and refusing church?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about not going to church with their girlfriend after her dad died, specifically on Easter. Both are not very religious, but her family is. She wanted to go to church with her family every year, but this year she can't fly home and asked him to go with her. He refused because he doesn't want to sit through the service and doesn't believe in it. They had a big fight, and now she's upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend's dad just died, so this is a sensitive time for her. She's trying to cope with her loss, and her family's traditions might be important for her to process that grief. Even though she's not very religious, the tradition of going to church on Easter might be a way for her to connect with her family and find comfort. The author's refusal might be seen as not supporting her through this difficult time, even if he doesn't share her beliefs.\n\nBut then, the author argues that neither of them is religious, and she even said she doesn't really want to go. He's being honest about his beliefs and not wanting to participate in something he's not comfortable with. So he's standing by his own values. However, in a relationship, especially during a partner's time of need, support and compromise are important. Even if he doesn't believe, maybe attending the service could be a gesture of support for her, even if he doesn't participate fully.\n\nThe key points here are about empathy and support. The author might be right in not wanting to fake his beliefs, but the girlfriend might feel that his refusal shows a lack of support. The question is whether respecting his beliefs outweighs the need to support her in her time of grief. Since the girlfriend is already upset and the situation led to a fight, it's possible that the author not going could be seen as inconsiderate, even if he has valid reasons.\n\nSo, considering all that, maybe the author is in the wrong because he could have found a middle ground. For example, attending the service without participating in the religious aspects, just being present. But if he truly can't do that, perhaps he should have communicated better and offered other forms of support. The answer might lean towards A, but I'm a bit conflicted. However, given the context of her loss and the importance of traditions in her family, the author's refusal might be seen as not being supportive enough, hence A.\n"
