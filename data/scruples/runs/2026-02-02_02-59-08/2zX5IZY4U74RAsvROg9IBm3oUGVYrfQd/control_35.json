I'm not at all and she goes every now and then, mostly on xmas and easter. Her family has always been really religious though and she did go to church with them alot when they wanted her to.\n\nHer dad died a couple months ago and it's something that she's been trying to get a handle on. I'm there for her and want to be there for her...at least until she asked me to go to church with her on Easter. Apparently she went on easter with her family every year. She can't fly home for Easter this year and asked me if I could go with her to church. I said no because one, I don't want to sit through the entire service, and two, I don't believe in any of that stuff. I told her that we don't even need to go now seeing as she's not all that religious. It turned into a huge fight about \"traditions\" and now she's crying and sulking. Look, I feel bad, but I just don't see the point. She even said she doesn't really want to go. Am I wrong for not bending my beliefs and refusing church?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for not going to church with his girlfriend after her dad died. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. Both the author and his girlfriend aren't very religious. The girlfriend's family is religious, and she went to church with them on big holidays like Christmas and Easter. Her dad died a few months ago, and she's dealing with that. On Easter, she asked him to go to church with her because that's a tradition her family has. But he refused because he's not religious and didn't want to sit through the service. He told her they don't need to go since she isn't that religious either. This led to a big fight.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's wrong. Let me break it down. The key points are: his lack of religious belief, her family's traditions, her emotional state after her dad's death, and the conflict that arose.\n\nOn one hand, respecting a partner's emotional needs and family traditions can be important in a relationship. Even if he's not religious, showing support might mean participating in her comfort rituals. If she wanted to go to church for emotional support, not necessarily for religion, his refusal might be seen as not supporting her through a tough time. Especially since she mentioned she can't fly home, so going with her might have been a way for her to feel connected to her family's tradition.\n\nOn the other hand, he's not religious and might not want to pretend or participate in something he doesn't believe in. It's also mentioned that she isn't super religious now, so maybe she didn't really want to go either. If that's the case, maybe she was conflicted and using the tradition as an excuse. However, the fact that she asked him to go suggests she wanted him to support her, even if she's ambivalent.\n\nThe fight might have been more about her feeling unsupported rather than the church itself. The author might not see the value in going, but from her perspective, it's about honoring her dad and family traditions during a hard time. If he can't support her in that, it might cause more issues in the relationship.\n\nI need to consider if refusing to participate in a partner's important tradition, even if not religious, is inconsiderate. It's possible he's being honest about his beliefs, but maybe he could have found another way to support her, like attending just part of the service or showing up for moral support. His refusal might come off as dismissive of her feelings and family's significance. \n\nSo, while he has his own beliefs and boundaries, in a relationship, compromise and support are key. If she asked and he could have made an effort, even if it's hard for him, it might have shown more empathy. Therefore, he might be in the wrong for not being supportive when she needed it.\n"
