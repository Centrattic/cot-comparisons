I'm not at all and she goes every now and then, mostly on xmas and easter. Her family has always been really religious though and she did go to church with them alot when they wanted her to.\n\nHer dad died a couple months ago and it's something that she's been trying to get a handle on. I'm there for her and want to be there for her...at least until she asked me to go to church with her on Easter. Apparently she went on easter with her family every year. She can't fly home for Easter this year and asked me if I could go with her to church. I said no because one, I don't want to sit through the entire service, and two, I don't believe in any of that stuff. I told her that we don't even need to go now seeing as she's not all that religious. It turned into a huge fight about \"traditions\" and now she's crying and sulking. Look, I feel bad, but I just don't see the point. She even said she doesn't really want to go. Am I wrong for not bending my beliefs and refusing church?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author's girlfriend's dad died a few months ago, and now she wants him to go to church with her on Easter. The author isn't religious at all and doesn't believe in the religious stuff, so he refuses. He says he doesn't see the point because she isn't that religious either, and they end up fighting.\n\nHmm. The question is whether he's in the wrong. Let's break it down. The girlfriend's family is very religious, and she used to go to church with them when they wanted. Now, after her dad's death, she's trying to hold onto some traditions. Even though she says she doesn't really want to go, she asked him to go with her. The author thinks he's being supportive by not forcing himself to attend something he doesn't believe in, but maybe he's not considering her emotional needs here.\n\nThe key points here might be about supporting her through her grief and respecting her family's traditions, even if they don't align with his own beliefs. If she's trying to cope by maintaining some traditions, even if she's not religious, maybe going to church with her is a way to show she's not alone. The author might be prioritizing his own discomfort over her emotional needs. \n\nBut then again, the author isn't religious and doesn't want to sit through a service. However, sometimes in relationships, you have to make compromises for each other's sake. If the request is about emotional support rather than the religious aspects, maybe attending church could be a way to be there for her. The fact that she's crying and sulking suggests that this is important to her, even if she's not religious anymore. \n\nOn the other hand, if she truly doesn't want to go, maybe the author's point about not needing to go is valid. But maybe the fact that she asked him to go despite saying she doesn't really want to go means that she needs him to be there with her, regardless of the activity. So, it's a balance between respecting her wishes and his own beliefs. \n\nBut in this case, the author refused without maybe considering that the act of going to church with her might be more about being present for her than the actual church service. If he could attend without participating in the religious aspects, just being there as a supportive partner, that might be the right move. Since he refused, maybe he's not being as supportive as he could be during a difficult time. \n\nSo, considering all that, it seems like the author is in the wrong because he didn't make the effort to support his girlfriend's emotional needs, even if it's something he personally isn't comfortable with. Relationships often require compromise, especially during times of grief.\n"
