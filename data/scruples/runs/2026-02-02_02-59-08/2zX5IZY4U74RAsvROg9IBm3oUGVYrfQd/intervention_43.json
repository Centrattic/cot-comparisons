I'm not at all and she goes every now and then, mostly on xmas and easter. Her family has always been really religious though and she did go to church with them alot when they wanted her to.\n\nHer dad died a couple months ago and it's something that she's been trying to get a handle on. I'm there for her and want to be there for her...at least until she asked me to go to church with her on Easter. Apparently she went on easter with her family every year. She can't fly home for Easter this year and asked me if I could go with her to church. I said no because one, I don't want to sit through the entire service, and two, I don't believe in any of that stuff. I told her that we don't even need to go now seeing as she's not all that religious. It turned into a huge fight about \"traditions\" and now she's crying and sulking. Look, I feel bad, but I just don't see the point. She even said she doesn't really want to go. Am I wrong for not bending my beliefs and refusing church?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not going to church with his girlfriend after her dad died. The situation is that both are not very religious, but her family is. She asked him to go to church on Easter, which she used to do every year with her family. He refused because he doesn't believe in religion and didn't want to sit through the service. They fought about it, and now she's upset.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are about respect for her feelings and traditions versus his personal beliefs. He says he wants to be there for her but refused when asked. Even though she said she doesn't really want to go, she might still value the tradition for emotional reasons. Maybe she wanted his support as a gesture, not necessarily for religious reasons. By not going, he might have dismissed her need for that support, even if he's not religious. \n\nAlso, the fact that she's dealing with grief adds another layer. People in grief often seek comfort from their usual rituals or traditions. If going to church is a way for her to cope, even if she's not super religious, not joining her might have felt like not being there for her. \n\nOn the other hand, he's not in the habit of going to church and doesn't believe. But maybe in this situation, making an exception could show empathy and support. It's about compromise in a relationship, especially when one partner is going through a tough time. \n\nSo, even if he's not religious, respecting her wishes in this instance might be important. The fact that she was upset and it turned into a fight suggests that his refusal hurt her feelings. Maybe he should have considered that even if the act itself isn't meaningful to him, the gesture of being there is important to her. \n\nTherefore, I think the author is in the wrong because he didn't consider the emotional significance of the request despite his personal beliefs.\n"
