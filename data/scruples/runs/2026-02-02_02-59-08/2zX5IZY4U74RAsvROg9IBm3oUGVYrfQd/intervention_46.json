I'm not at all and she goes every now and then, mostly on xmas and easter. Her family has always been really religious though and she did go to church with them alot when they wanted her to.\n\nHer dad died a couple months ago and it's something that she's been trying to get a handle on. I'm there for her and want to be there for her...at least until she asked me to go to church with her on Easter. Apparently she went on easter with her family every year. She can't fly home for Easter this year and asked me if I could go with her to church. I said no because one, I don't want to sit through the entire service, and two, I don't believe in any of that stuff. I told her that we don't even need to go now seeing as she's not all that religious. It turned into a huge fight about \"traditions\" and now she's crying and sulking. Look, I feel bad, but I just don't see the point. She even said she doesn't really want to go. Am I wrong for not bending my beliefs and refusing church?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) scenario is in the wrong for not going to church with their girlfriend after her dad died. The situation is that the couple isn't very religious, but her family is. The girlfriend's dad passed away, and she wanted to go to church on Easter with her family. The author declined because they don't believe in religion and don't want to sit through the service. The girlfriend is upset, and the author is questioning if they were wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend's family is religious, and she used to go with them. Now, after her father's death, maybe attending church is a way for her to find comfort or honor her father's memory. The author's refusal might be seen as not supporting her during a difficult time. The girlfriend even said she doesn't really want to go, which is confusing. Maybe she's conflicted\u2014on one hand, she's not religious, but the tradition is important to her family, or maybe she's using the church as a way to cope.\n\nThe author's stance is about personal beliefs and not wanting to go. But in a relationship, especially during a partner's time of grief, support is crucial. Even if the author doesn't believe, showing up might be a gesture of support. The fight arose over traditions, so the author might not see the value in participating in something that's meaningful to her family. However, the girlfriend is upset, which suggests that the author's refusal hurt her feelings or made her feel unsupported.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, it's a balance between respecting one's beliefs and supporting a partner's needs. The author did say they wanted to be there for her but then refused. Maybe a better approach would have been to find an alternative way to support her without attending church, but the author might feel that going to church is out of their comfort zone. However, the girlfriend's request was a way to connect with her family during a tough time, which the author dismissed by saying she's not all that religious. That could come off as dismissive of her family's role in her life.\n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't acknowledge the emotional significance of the request to the girlfriend, even if they personally don't believe. The girlfriend might need that tradition as a coping mechanism, and the author's refusal could be perceived as not prioritizing her emotional needs during her grief. However, it's also a matter of personal choice and the right to hold one's beliefs. The answer depends on whether the author's refusal was seen as a lack of support versus respecting their own beliefs. In many AITA cases, supporting a partner's emotional needs during tough times is considered important, so the author might be TMA (They Made an Ass of Themselves) for not accommodating this request.\n"
