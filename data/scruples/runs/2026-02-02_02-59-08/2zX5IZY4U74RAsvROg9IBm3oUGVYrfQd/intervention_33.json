I'm not at all and she goes every now and then, mostly on xmas and easter. Her family has always been really religious though and she did go to church with them alot when they wanted her to.\n\nHer dad died a couple months ago and it's something that she's been trying to get a handle on. I'm there for her and want to be there for her...at least until she asked me to go to church with her on Easter. Apparently she went on easter with her family every year. She can't fly home for Easter this year and asked me if I could go with her to church. I said no because one, I don't want to sit through the entire service, and two, I don't believe in any of that stuff. I told her that we don't even need to go now seeing as she's not all that religious. It turned into a huge fight about \"traditions\" and now she's crying and sulking. Look, I feel bad, but I just don't see the point. She even said she doesn't really want to go. Am I wrong for not bending my beliefs and refusing church?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not going to church with their girlfriend after her dad died. The situation is that neither the author nor the girlfriend are very religious. The girlfriend's family is religious, and she used to go to church more often when her family wanted her to. Now, after her father's death, she asked the author to go to church with her on Easter, but he refused because he doesn't want to sit through the service and doesn't believe in religion. They had a fight, and the girlfriend is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend is dealing with grief and possibly looking for support from her family's traditions. Even though they aren't religious, she might see the church as a place to find comfort or connect with her family's customs during a difficult time. The author's refusal could be seen as not supporting her emotional needs, even if it's not about religion. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is being honest about his beliefs and not wanting to participate in something he doesn't believe in. The girlfriend also said she doesn't really want to go, which complicates things. Maybe she felt pressured to go for tradition's sake, and the author's refusal highlighted that tension. \n\nBut in a relationship, supporting each other through difficult times often involves making compromises. Even if the author isn't religious, showing up for his girlfriend's emotional support might be more important. The fact that she's crying and sulking suggests that this was significant to her. \n\nSo, while the author has a right to his beliefs, the key issue here is about support during grief. Not going might have been perceived as not being there for her when she needed him. Therefore, the author could be in the wrong for not finding a way to support her, even if it meant attending a service he doesn't believe in.\n"
