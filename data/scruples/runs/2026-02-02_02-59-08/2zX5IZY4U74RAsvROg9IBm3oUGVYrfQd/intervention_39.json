I'm not at all and she goes every now and then, mostly on xmas and easter. Her family has always been really religious though and she did go to church with them alot when they wanted her to.\n\nHer dad died a couple months ago and it's something that she's been trying to get a handle on. I'm there for her and want to be there for her...at least until she asked me to go to church with her on Easter. Apparently she went on easter with her family every year. She can't fly home for Easter this year and asked me if I could go with her to church. I said no because one, I don't want to sit through the entire service, and two, I don't believe in any of that stuff. I told her that we don't even need to go now seeing as she's not all that religious. It turned into a huge fight about \"traditions\" and now she's crying and sulking. Look, I feel bad, but I just don't see the point. She even said she doesn't really want to go. Am I wrong for not bending my beliefs and refusing church?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for not going to church with their girlfriend after her dad died. The situation is that neither the author nor the girlfriend are very religious, but her family is. The dad recently died, and she wanted to go to church on Easter, which is a tradition for her family. The author refused because he doesn't want to sit through the service and doesn't believe in it. Now they're fighting about traditions, and the girlfriend is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The girlfriend's family is religious, and she had a tradition of going to church with them every Easter. Her father's death is part of the context, so this church visit might be more about coping with grief and maintaining family traditions. The author is trying to support her but refuses to attend because of his personal beliefs and lack of interest. The question is whether this refusal makes him at fault.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, he's being honest about his beliefs and doesn't want to attend. He also mentions that the girlfriend isn't that religious either. However, the problem here is that the request might be about emotional support rather than just the religious aspect. Even if the author isn't religious, showing up as a supportive partner could be important for her, especially during a grieving period. The fact that she's upset and they had a big fight suggests that this is a significant issue for her.\n\nAnother angle is the concept of compromise in relationships. Partners often need to make sacrifices or attend events that aren't their preference to support each other. The author's refusal might be seen as not prioritizing his girlfriend's emotional needs during a difficult time. Even if attending church is uncomfortable for him, there might be a way to find a middle ground, like attending a shorter service or finding another way to support her without participating in the church itself.\n\nHowever, there's also the argument that the author has the right to his beliefs. If he's not religious and it's a genuine discomfort, forcing himself to attend might not be authentic. But the key here is the context of her grief and family traditions. The girlfriend's participation might be more about honoring her father's memory and connecting with her family, which could be therapeutic for her.\n\nIn many AITA scenarios, the issue is about empathy and considering the other person's feelings. The author might be missing the emotional significance of the request for his girlfriend. Even if she says she doesn't want to go, the fact that she asked him to go suggests that she values the tradition and might expect support from him. His refusal, even if he's being honest, could be perceived as dismissive of her needs during a vulnerable time.\n\nSo, weighing these factors: the author's right to his beliefs versus the girlfriend's emotional needs and the importance of traditions in her family and grieving process. The answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong because he didn't consider her emotional state and the symbolic importance of the church visit, even if it's not religious for her. However, some might argue that he's within his rights. But in relationship dynamics, supporting each other through significant family events, even if they're not personally preferred, is often expected.\n"
