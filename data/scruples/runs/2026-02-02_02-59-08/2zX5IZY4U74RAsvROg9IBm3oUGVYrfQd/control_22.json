I'm not at all and she goes every now and then, mostly on xmas and easter. Her family has always been really religious though and she did go to church with them alot when they wanted her to.\n\nHer dad died a couple months ago and it's something that she's been trying to get a handle on. I'm there for her and want to be there for her...at least until she asked me to go to church with her on Easter. Apparently she went on easter with her family every year. She can't fly home for Easter this year and asked me if I could go with her to church. I said no because one, I don't want to sit through the entire service, and two, I don't believe in any of that stuff. I told her that we don't even need to go now seeing as she's not all that religious. It turned into a huge fight about \"traditions\" and now she's crying and sulking. Look, I feel bad, but I just don't see the point. She even said she doesn't really want to go. Am I wrong for not bending my beliefs and refusing church?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not going to church with his girlfriend after her dad died. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the context: Neither the author nor his girlfriend are very religious. The girl's family is religious, and she used to go with them on holidays. Her dad died recently, and she asked him to go to church with her on Easter because it was a tradition. He refused because he's not religious and didn't want to sit through the service. The girlfriend got upset, leading to a fight.\n\nSo, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Let me think about the key points here. When someone is grieving, especially after losing a parent, they might seek comfort in traditions, even if they're not deeply religious. The girlfriend mentioned she's not very religious now but still wanted to go. The author's refusal could be seen as not supporting her emotional needs during a tough time. \n\nHowever, the author argues that neither of them are religious and that she even said she doesn't want to go. But maybe she wanted to go for the sake of her family's tradition or her own closure. The fact that she's been trying to handle the loss and asked him to accompany her shows she wanted his support. Refusing might have made her feel unsupported, even if it's not a religious act for her.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's stance is about personal beliefs and not wanting to pretend. But in relationships, compromise is often necessary. Even if he doesn't believe in the religion, showing up to support her could be about being there emotionally. The fact that he told her they don't need to go now because she's not religious might have dismissed her feelings of needing to follow the tradition for her family's sake.\n\nAlso, the fight that ensued and her crying suggests that his refusal was hurtful. Even if he's not religious, his partner's emotional state is important. Not attending church might not have been the issue itself, but how he handled her request and the communication around it. Maybe he could have expressed his reluctance but found another way to support her, like attending a different event or being present in another way.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author might be in the wrong because he didn't support his girlfriend during her time of need, even if his reasons are about personal beliefs. Relationships often require giving up certain things to support each other's emotional needs. His refusal, despite her asking and being upset, shows a lack of empathy towards her situation.\n"
