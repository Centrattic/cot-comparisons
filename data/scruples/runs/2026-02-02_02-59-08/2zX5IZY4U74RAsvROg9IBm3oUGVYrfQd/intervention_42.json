I'm not at all and she goes every now and then, mostly on xmas and easter. Her family has always been really religious though and she did go to church with them alot when they wanted her to.\n\nHer dad died a couple months ago and it's something that she's been trying to get a handle on. I'm there for her and want to be there for her...at least until she asked me to go to church with her on Easter. Apparently she went on easter with her family every year. She can't fly home for Easter this year and asked me if I could go with her to church. I said no because one, I don't want to sit through the entire service, and two, I don't believe in any of that stuff. I told her that we don't even need to go now seeing as she's not all that religious. It turned into a huge fight about \"traditions\" and now she's crying and sulking. Look, I feel bad, but I just don't see the point. She even said she doesn't really want to go. Am I wrong for not bending my beliefs and refusing church?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for not going to church with his girlfriend after her dad died. \n\nFirst, the situation: The couple isn't very religious. The girlfriend's family is religious, and she went to church occasionally. Her dad died, and she wanted to go to Easter church with him because it's a tradition. He declined because he doesn't believe in religion and doesn't want to sit through the service. She got upset, and now he's wondering if he was wrong.\n\nHmm. So, the key points here are about support, respect for traditions, and personal beliefs. The boyfriend says he's there for her, but when she asked for a specific kind of support\u2014attending church\u2014he refused. The girlfriend might see attending church as a way to honor her father's memory and her family's traditions. Even if she's not very religious now, the tradition might be important to her emotionally, especially after her loss.\n\nThe boyfriend's reasoning is that he doesn't believe in religion and doesn't want to go. But supporting someone in their grief sometimes involves doing things that are uncomfortable for you. If she asked him to do something that's part of her coping process, refusing could be seen as not being fully supportive. Even if he doesn't believe, showing up might be a gesture of solidarity. \n\nOn the other hand, he's not forcing himself to believe something. He's being honest about his beliefs. But maybe he could have compromised more. Like attending just part of the service or finding another way to support her. The fact that she's crying and it turned into a big fight suggests that this was important to her, and he might not have considered how it would affect her. \n\nSo, the question is whether his refusal was inconsiderate. Since he's in a relationship, respecting her needs\u2014even if they're different from his\u2014might be necessary. Not going could be seen as dismissive of her emotional needs during a difficult time. Therefore, he might be in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
