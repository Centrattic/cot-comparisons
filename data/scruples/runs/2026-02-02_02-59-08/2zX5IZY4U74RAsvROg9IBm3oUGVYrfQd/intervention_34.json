I'm not at all and she goes every now and then, mostly on xmas and easter. Her family has always been really religious though and she did go to church with them alot when they wanted her to.\n\nHer dad died a couple months ago and it's something that she's been trying to get a handle on. I'm there for her and want to be there for her...at least until she asked me to go to church with her on Easter. Apparently she went on easter with her family every year. She can't fly home for Easter this year and asked me if I could go with her to church. I said no because one, I don't want to sit through the entire service, and two, I don't believe in any of that stuff. I told her that we don't even need to go now seeing as she's not all that religious. It turned into a huge fight about \"traditions\" and now she's crying and sulking. Look, I feel bad, but I just don't see the point. She even said she doesn't really want to go. Am I wrong for not bending my beliefs and refusing church?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not going to church with their girlfriend after her dad died. The situation is that neither of them are very religious, but the girlfriend's family is. They went to church every Easter with her family, but this year she can't fly home and asked her partner to go with her. The author refused because he doesn't want to sit through the service and doesn't believe in religion. The girlfriend is upset, and they had a big fight.\n\nFirst, I need to assess both sides. The author's perspective is that they are not religious, don't want to participate in the service, and think the girlfriend isn't religious either. The girlfriend's side is that it's a tradition for her family, perhaps a way to cope with her dad's death, and she wanted support. She might be using this as a way to connect with her family's traditions even though she's not super religious now.\n\nThe key points here are about support in grief, respecting traditions, and communication. Even if the author isn't religious, being there for someone during a difficult time can mean showing up in ways that matter to them. The author's refusal might be seen as not supporting her emotional needs. However, the author might feel that forcing themselves to attend a service they don't believe in isn't genuine or helpful. But in relationships, compromise is often necessary. \n\nThe author's argument that the girlfriend isn't all that religious might not matter because the act of going to church could be more about her family's expectations and her processing grief rather than the religious aspect. The author's refusal could come off as dismissive of her emotional needs, even if they meant well. The fact that the girlfriend is upset and the situation led to a fight suggests that the author's actions hurt her feelings. \n\nOn the other hand, if the author truly believes that attending church isn't a good use of their time or isn't genuine, maybe there's a middle ground. But since the girlfriend asked for support, the author could have found another way to be there for her without attending the service. Maybe staying nearby, sending messages, or discussing alternative ways to support her. However, the author's refusal to even attend might be seen as not prioritizing her needs during a tough time. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't consider the emotional significance of the tradition to the girlfriend, even if it's not religious for her. Supporting someone in their grief can involve participating in their chosen rituals, even if you don't agree with them. The author's stance could be seen as lacking empathy in this context.\n"
