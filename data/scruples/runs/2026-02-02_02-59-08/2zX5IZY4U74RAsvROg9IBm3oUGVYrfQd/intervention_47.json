I'm not at all and she goes every now and then, mostly on xmas and easter. Her family has always been really religious though and she did go to church with them alot when they wanted her to.\n\nHer dad died a couple months ago and it's something that she's been trying to get a handle on. I'm there for her and want to be there for her...at least until she asked me to go to church with her on Easter. Apparently she went on easter with her family every year. She can't fly home for Easter this year and asked me if I could go with her to church. I said no because one, I don't want to sit through the entire service, and two, I don't believe in any of that stuff. I told her that we don't even need to go now seeing as she's not all that religious. It turned into a huge fight about \"traditions\" and now she's crying and sulking. Look, I feel bad, but I just don't see the point. She even said she doesn't really want to go. Am I wrong for not bending my beliefs and refusing church?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about not going to church with his girlfriend after her dad died. The girlfriend is only somewhat religious, going mainly for holidays like Christmas and Easter. Her family is very religious, and she used to go with them when they wanted. Now her dad has died, and she wanted to go to church on Easter, but the author refused because he's not religious and doesn't want to sit through the service.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend is dealing with grief and might be seeking comfort through her family's traditions. Even if they aren't super religious, traditions can be important during tough times. The author says he's there for her, but when asked to attend church, he refused, pointing out that she's not really religious now. That might come off as dismissive of her emotional needs.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. They might be considering the emotional support aspect. Even if the author doesn't believe in religion, supporting the girlfriend in her way of coping could be important. The fight that ensued suggests that the refusal hurt her feelings, especially since she was already grieving. The author might not have considered how his refusal affects her emotionally, beyond just his own beliefs.\n\nOn the other hand, the author could argue that he's being honest about his beliefs and that compromising would mean pretending to believe in something he doesn't. But in relationships, sometimes supporting each other through difficult times requires compromise, even if it's not personal belief systems. The key here is whether the refusal was a lack of support during her time of need. If the girlfriend wanted to go to church as part of her healing, then the author's refusal might be seen as not being there for her, even if it's just a church service. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that she doesn't really want to go, but if she asked him to go, that implies she does want his presence, even if she's not religious. It's about being there for her emotionally, not necessarily sharing the same beliefs. So, the answer might lean towards A, the author is in the wrong, because he's not supporting her emotional needs during a tough time, even if it's a religious activity he's not comfortable with.\n"
