I'm not at all and she goes every now and then, mostly on xmas and easter. Her family has always been really religious though and she did go to church with them alot when they wanted her to.\n\nHer dad died a couple months ago and it's something that she's been trying to get a handle on. I'm there for her and want to be there for her...at least until she asked me to go to church with her on Easter. Apparently she went on easter with her family every year. She can't fly home for Easter this year and asked me if I could go with her to church. I said no because one, I don't want to sit through the entire service, and two, I don't believe in any of that stuff. I told her that we don't even need to go now seeing as she's not all that religious. It turned into a huge fight about \"traditions\" and now she's crying and sulking. Look, I feel bad, but I just don't see the point. She even said she doesn't really want to go. Am I wrong for not bending my beliefs and refusing church?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author's girlfriend asked him to go to church with her on Easter after her father died. The author refused because he's not religious and didn't want to sit through the service. The girlfriend was upset, even though she admitted she didn't really want to go either.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are about the relationship dynamics and mutual support. The girlfriend is trying to cope with her father's death, and her family is very religious. Even though she's not super religious now, maybe going to church was a way for her to honor her father's memory or connect with her family's traditions during a tough time. The author, while supportive in other ways, refused to go to church, which made her emotional.\n\nThe author argues that he's not religious and doesn't see the point, and the girlfriend herself said she doesn't really want to go. But maybe the act of going to church is more about the emotional support from her partner rather than the religious aspect. Even if the author doesn't believe in it, showing up could be a way to say, \"I'm here for you, even if I don't share your beliefs.\" \n\nOn the other hand, the author might feel like he's being asked to participate in something that goes against his personal beliefs. It's a balance between respecting each other's beliefs and being supportive. If the girlfriend truly didn't want to go, maybe the author could have asked more questions to understand her needs better. But since she did ask, perhaps the author should have tried to accommodate, even if it was just attending without participating. \n\nSo, is it wrong to refuse? It depends on how much effort each person is willing to put into the relationship. The author might think he's staying true to himself, but the girlfriend might feel unappreciated or unsupported. Since the author is in a romantic relationship, there's an expectation of compromise. Even if the author's reasons are valid, refusing without trying to find a middle ground could be seen as not being supportive enough. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
