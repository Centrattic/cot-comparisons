I'm not at all and she goes every now and then, mostly on xmas and easter. Her family has always been really religious though and she did go to church with them alot when they wanted her to.\n\nHer dad died a couple months ago and it's something that she's been trying to get a handle on. I'm there for her and want to be there for her...at least until she asked me to go to church with her on Easter. Apparently she went on easter with her family every year. She can't fly home for Easter this year and asked me if I could go with her to church. I said no because one, I don't want to sit through the entire service, and two, I don't believe in any of that stuff. I told her that we don't even need to go now seeing as she's not all that religious. It turned into a huge fight about \"traditions\" and now she's crying and sulking. Look, I feel bad, but I just don't see the point. She even said she doesn't really want to go. Am I wrong for not bending my beliefs and refusing church?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not going to church with their girlfriend after her dad died. The author isn't religious and their girlfriend isn't either, except for holidays. Her family is religious, and she used to go with them. Now, after her dad's death, she wanted to go to Easter church, but the author refused because they don't believe and don't want to sit through the service. The girlfriend got upset, even though she said she didn't really want to go either.\n\nHmm. So the question is about whether the author is wrong. The key points here are about respect for traditions, the girlfriend's emotional needs, and mutual compromise in a relationship. The author claims they're not religious and don't believe, but the girlfriend's family's traditions might be important to her, especially during a time of grief. Even if the girlfriend isn't super religious, going to church might be a way to honor her dad or connect with her family.\n\nBut the author argues that the girlfriend doesn't really want to go, so maybe they didn't need to go. However, the fact that it led to a fight suggests that the action hurt her feelings. In relationships, sometimes you have to do things that don't align with your beliefs if it's important to your partner for emotional support. The author might not be in the wrong in terms of their beliefs, but maybe in terms of not being supportive enough during a tough time. Alternatively, if the girlfriend isn't into it, maybe the author isn't wrong for not going. But the situation is sensitive because of the recent loss. It's a bit of a gray area. The answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong for not considering her feelings and the importance of the tradition to her family, even if he's not religious. So, A for yes.\n"
