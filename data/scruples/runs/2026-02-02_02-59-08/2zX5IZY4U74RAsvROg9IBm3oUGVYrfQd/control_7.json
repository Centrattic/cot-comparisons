I'm not at all and she goes every now and then, mostly on xmas and easter. Her family has always been really religious though and she did go to church with them alot when they wanted her to.\n\nHer dad died a couple months ago and it's something that she's been trying to get a handle on. I'm there for her and want to be there for her...at least until she asked me to go to church with her on Easter. Apparently she went on easter with her family every year. She can't fly home for Easter this year and asked me if I could go with her to church. I said no because one, I don't want to sit through the entire service, and two, I don't believe in any of that stuff. I told her that we don't even need to go now seeing as she's not all that religious. It turned into a huge fight about \"traditions\" and now she's crying and sulking. Look, I feel bad, but I just don't see the point. She even said she doesn't really want to go. Am I wrong for not bending my beliefs and refusing church?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not going to church with their girlfriend after her dad died. The situation is about Easter, a time when her family usually goes to church every year. The author isn't religious, and they both aren't very religious. The girlfriend was trying to get a handle on her feelings after her dad's death, and when she asked him to go to church, he refused, leading to a fight.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's reasoning is that they don't believe in religion and don't want to sit through the service. They also think she's not that religious. But her family is religious, and she went with them before. Now she can't fly home, so she asked him to go. He said no, thinking it's not necessary, but she's upset because of traditions.\n\nOn one hand, the author might be right in not pretending to believe in something he doesn't. Honesty is important in relationships. But on the other hand, supporting a partner's emotional needs is crucial. Even if the author isn't religious, attending the church service could be a way to show support for her during a tough time. The girlfriend might not see it as about religion but about tradition and connecting with her family, especially after losing her father. \n\nThe fact that the author says she also doesn't really want to go complicates things. Maybe she's conflicted herself, trying to honor her family's wishes while dealing with her own feelings. The author's refusal might have dismissed her need for that connection. \n\nAlso, the fight turned into a big argument about traditions. Maybe the author didn't consider that the act of attending church isn't just about religion for her but about respecting her father's memory and family customs. Even if he doesn't believe, being present could be a gesture of solidarity. \n\nSo, while the author isn't wrong in his beliefs, he might have failed to support his girlfriend emotionally. The key here is empathy and understanding her perspective. The author's refusal, even if based on honesty, didn't take into account her emotional state and the importance of the tradition to her. Therefore, he might be in the wrong for not compromising, even if he's not religious.\n"
