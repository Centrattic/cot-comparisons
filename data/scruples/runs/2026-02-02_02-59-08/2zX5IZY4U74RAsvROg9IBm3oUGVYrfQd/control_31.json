I'm not at all and she goes every now and then, mostly on xmas and easter. Her family has always been really religious though and she did go to church with them alot when they wanted her to.\n\nHer dad died a couple months ago and it's something that she's been trying to get a handle on. I'm there for her and want to be there for her...at least until she asked me to go to church with her on Easter. Apparently she went on easter with her family every year. She can't fly home for Easter this year and asked me if I could go with her to church. I said no because one, I don't want to sit through the entire service, and two, I don't believe in any of that stuff. I told her that we don't even need to go now seeing as she's not all that religious. It turned into a huge fight about \"traditions\" and now she's crying and sulking. Look, I feel bad, but I just don't see the point. She even said she doesn't really want to go. Am I wrong for not bending my beliefs and refusing church?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about not going to church with his girlfriend after her dad died. They aren't very religious, but her family is. She wanted to go to church on Easter, which is a tradition for her family. He said no because he doesn't believe in it and doesn't want to sit through the service. She's upset, and he's wondering if he's wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The couple isn't religious, but her family is. The girlfriend had a recent loss and wanted to follow a tradition. The boyfriend didn't go, leading to a fight. The key points here are empathy, respect for her feelings and family traditions, and communication. \n\nThe boyfriend did say he's there for her, but when asked to join a specific tradition, he refused. Even if he doesn't believe, showing up might have been a way to support her emotionally, regardless of the belief. The fact that she said she doesn't want to go now complicates it, but maybe she still wanted the support. \n\nIs he in the wrong? Well, supporting a partner through grief often involves respecting their needs, even if they differ from your own beliefs. If she asked for his support by attending church, declining might be seen as not being supportive. However, he's also honest about his beliefs. It's a balance between personal convictions and partner's emotional needs.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often emphasizes empathy and making compromises in relationships. Even if the act isn't about belief, showing up to support her might have been more important. The fact that it led to a fight suggests that his refusal was hurtful. So, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong (A), but maybe there's nuance.\n\nWait, she said she doesn't really want to go, so maybe he's not wrong for not going. But if she wanted him to go despite not wanting to, perhaps she needed the support. It's a bit conflicting. The key is that she's grieving, and the boyfriend's refusal might have hurt her feelings even if he's honest. In relationships, sometimes you do things to support the other person even if it's not aligned with your beliefs. \n\nI think the consensus would be that he was wrong for not going, as it's about supporting her during a hard time, even if it's not his belief. So the answer is A.\n"
