I'm not at all and she goes every now and then, mostly on xmas and easter. Her family has always been really religious though and she did go to church with them alot when they wanted her to.\n\nHer dad died a couple months ago and it's something that she's been trying to get a handle on. I'm there for her and want to be there for her...at least until she asked me to go to church with her on Easter. Apparently she went on easter with her family every year. She can't fly home for Easter this year and asked me if I could go with her to church. I said no because one, I don't want to sit through the entire service, and two, I don't believe in any of that stuff. I told her that we don't even need to go now seeing as she's not all that religious. It turned into a huge fight about \"traditions\" and now she's crying and sulking. Look, I feel bad, but I just don't see the point. She even said she doesn't really want to go. Am I wrong for not bending my beliefs and refusing church?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for not going to church with his girlfriend after her dad died. \n\nFirst, the context: Neither he nor his girlfriend are very religious. She goes occasionally, mostly for big holidays like Christmas and Easter. Her family is religious, and she used to go with them when they wanted. Her dad died a few months ago, and she's still dealing with that. She asked him to go to church with her on Easter, which she mentions was a tradition of going with her family every year. He refused, citing that he doesn't want to sit through the service and doesn't believe in religion. He said they don't need to go now since she's not that religious. This led to a big fight about traditions, and she's upset.\n\nSo, the main issue here is about respecting her emotional needs and traditions, especially during a time of grief. The girlfriend might see the church as a place of comfort and a way to honor her father's memory, even if she's not super religious. The boyfriend's refusal might come off as dismissive of her feelings or the significance of the tradition to her. \n\nHe argues that she doesn't really want to go, but maybe she does need the support, even if she's conflicted. The fact that she asked him to go suggests she wanted his presence for emotional support, not necessarily to share her beliefs. His refusal might be seen as not being there for her during a hard time, which could be hurtful. \n\nOn the other hand, he's honest about his beliefs and isn't pretending to be religious. But in relationships, especially when there's a cultural or family expectation, compromise might be necessary. The key is whether he's being considerate of her needs. If she felt that going to church would help her cope, his refusal without trying to understand her perspective could be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer leans towards the author being in the wrong (A) because he didn't accommodate her emotional needs during a difficult time, even if his own beliefs are genuine. Relationships often require flexibility, especially when supporting a partner through loss.\n"
