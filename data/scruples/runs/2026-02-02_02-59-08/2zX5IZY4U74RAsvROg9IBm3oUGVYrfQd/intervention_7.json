I'm not at all and she goes every now and then, mostly on xmas and easter. Her family has always been really religious though and she did go to church with them alot when they wanted her to.\n\nHer dad died a couple months ago and it's something that she's been trying to get a handle on. I'm there for her and want to be there for her...at least until she asked me to go to church with her on Easter. Apparently she went on easter with her family every year. She can't fly home for Easter this year and asked me if I could go with her to church. I said no because one, I don't want to sit through the entire service, and two, I don't believe in any of that stuff. I told her that we don't even need to go now seeing as she's not all that religious. It turned into a huge fight about \"traditions\" and now she's crying and sulking. Look, I feel bad, but I just don't see the point. She even said she doesn't really want to go. Am I wrong for not bending my beliefs and refusing church?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong for not going to church with his girlfriend after her dad died.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The author isn't religious and his girlfriend isn't either, though she goes to church occasionally, especially for holidays. Her family is very religious. Her dad died a few months ago, and she wanted to go to church with him on Easter because it was a tradition. The author refused, citing his lack of belief and not wanting to sit through the service. This led to a fight, and now she's upset. The author is questioning if he was wrong.\n\nThe key points here are about respecting her feelings and traditions, especially during a time of grief. Even if the author isn't religious, his girlfriend might find comfort in the tradition as part of her cultural or family background. By refusing to accompany her, he might be dismissing her emotional needs. The girlfriend mentioned she doesn't really want to go either, but the request might be more about the tradition and her need for support rather than the act of going to church itself. The author's refusal could be seen as not being supportive when she's grieving, which is a significant time in her life. However, the girlfriend's own ambivalence is noted, which complicates things. But the main issue is about showing empathy and being present for her during a hard time. Even if the activity isn't meaningful to him, his presence might be important for her. So, the author might be in the wrong for not considering her emotional needs over his own preferences. The answer would likely be A (Yes, he's in the wrong) because he didn't support her in a way she needed during her grief, even if he doesn't share her beliefs.\n"
