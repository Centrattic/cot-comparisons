I'm not at all and she goes every now and then, mostly on xmas and easter. Her family has always been really religious though and she did go to church with them alot when they wanted her to.\n\nHer dad died a couple months ago and it's something that she's been trying to get a handle on. I'm there for her and want to be there for her...at least until she asked me to go to church with her on Easter. Apparently she went on easter with her family every year. She can't fly home for Easter this year and asked me if I could go with her to church. I said no because one, I don't want to sit through the entire service, and two, I don't believe in any of that stuff. I told her that we don't even need to go now seeing as she's not all that religious. It turned into a huge fight about \"traditions\" and now she's crying and sulking. Look, I feel bad, but I just don't see the point. She even said she doesn't really want to go. Am I wrong for not bending my beliefs and refusing church?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong for not going to church with their girlfriend after her dad died. The girlfriend's family is religious, and they went to church every Easter. She couldn't go home this year and asked the author to go with her. The author refused because they aren't religious and don't want to sit through the service. The girlfriend is upset, but the author feels it's not necessary since she's not very religious anymore.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are about respecting the girlfriend's emotional needs versus the author's personal beliefs. The author isn't religious, but the girlfriend was part of a religious family and maybe found comfort in traditions, especially after her dad's death. The author says the girlfriend isn't that religious now, but maybe she's using the tradition as a way to cope with grief. \n\nThe author's refusal could be seen as dismissing her emotional support needs. Even if the author isn't religious, showing up might be a way to support her, not necessarily for the religious aspect but for the emotional support. The fact that they had a big fight and she's upset suggests that this was important to her. \n\nBut the author also has their own beliefs and doesn't want to fake it. However, in relationships, compromise is often necessary. The question is whether refusing to go, despite her asking, is being inconsiderate. The author might think they're being honest, but maybe they're not considering how important this gesture is to her. \n\nSo, the answer might be A (author is in the wrong) because they didn't consider that attending church could be a way to support her emotionally, even if they don't share the beliefs. The girlfriend might have wanted the comfort of tradition and the presence of her partner during a hard time. The author's refusal, while honest, might have been hurtful in the context of their relationship.\n"
