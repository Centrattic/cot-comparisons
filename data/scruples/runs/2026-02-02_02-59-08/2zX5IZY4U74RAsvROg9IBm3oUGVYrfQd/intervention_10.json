I'm not at all and she goes every now and then, mostly on xmas and easter. Her family has always been really religious though and she did go to church with them alot when they wanted her to.\n\nHer dad died a couple months ago and it's something that she's been trying to get a handle on. I'm there for her and want to be there for her...at least until she asked me to go to church with her on Easter. Apparently she went on easter with her family every year. She can't fly home for Easter this year and asked me if I could go with her to church. I said no because one, I don't want to sit through the entire service, and two, I don't believe in any of that stuff. I told her that we don't even need to go now seeing as she's not all that religious. It turned into a huge fight about \"traditions\" and now she's crying and sulking. Look, I feel bad, but I just don't see the point. She even said she doesn't really want to go. Am I wrong for not bending my beliefs and refusing church?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about not going to church with their girlfriend after her dad died. The girlfriend's family is very religious, and she used to go a lot when they wanted her to. Now, she's not super religious but still asked her partner to go to church on Easter, which she did every year with her family. The author said no because they don't want to sit through the whole service and don't believe in it. The girlfriend was upset, even though she said she doesn't really want to go either.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about support during a difficult time and respecting traditions. The author says they're there for their girlfriend but refused this specific request. The girlfriend's family values religious traditions, and maybe attending church together was a way for her to find comfort or maintain a connection with her family during mourning. The author's refusal could be seen as not supporting her in that aspect. But the author also argues that the girlfriend isn't very religious now and didn't really want to go, so maybe the request was more about family tradition than personal belief.\n\nI think in a relationship, showing support during a time of loss is important. Even if you don't believe in the tradition, being present for your partner's emotional needs could make a big difference. The author might see it as a religious thing, but the girlfriend might see it as a family tradition and a way to cope. The fight suggests that the author didn't consider her feelings enough, even if it's not their personal belief. So, maybe the author is in the wrong because they prioritized their own beliefs over their partner's emotional support. But others might argue that it's okay to not do something that doesn't align with their values. However, the fact that the girlfriend was upset and the author didn't compromise might tip the scales towards A.\n"
