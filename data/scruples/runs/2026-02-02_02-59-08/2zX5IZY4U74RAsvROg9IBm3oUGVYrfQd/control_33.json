I'm not at all and she goes every now and then, mostly on xmas and easter. Her family has always been really religious though and she did go to church with them alot when they wanted her to.\n\nHer dad died a couple months ago and it's something that she's been trying to get a handle on. I'm there for her and want to be there for her...at least until she asked me to go to church with her on Easter. Apparently she went on easter with her family every year. She can't fly home for Easter this year and asked me if I could go with her to church. I said no because one, I don't want to sit through the entire service, and two, I don't believe in any of that stuff. I told her that we don't even need to go now seeing as she's not all that religious. It turned into a huge fight about \"traditions\" and now she's crying and sulking. Look, I feel bad, but I just don't see the point. She even said she doesn't really want to go. Am I wrong for not bending my beliefs and refusing church?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA story is in the wrong. So, the situation is that the author's girlfriend asked him to go to church with her on Easter after her dad died a few months ago. The author declined because he's not religious and doesn't want to sit through the service. The girlfriend's family is very religious, and she used to go with them. Now she's upset, and they had a big fight.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author feels that since neither he nor his girlfriend is very religious, attending church isn't necessary. He also points out that she said she doesn't really want to go, which might imply that she's conflicted between her family's traditions and her own feelings. On the other hand, the girlfriend is grieving her father, and Easter is a significant time for her family, so attending church could be a way for her to find comfort or maintain a connection to her family's traditions, even if she's not deeply religious now.\n\nThe author's refusal could be seen as not supporting her during a difficult time. Even if the author isn't religious, showing support for her emotional needs might be important. The fact that she can't fly home to her family adds to the situation; maybe attending church with her is a way for her to feel connected to her family and their support system during her grief. \n\nHowever, the author isn't wrong in feeling that he shouldn't have to go against his beliefs to please her. But in a relationship, compromise is key. The author might have underestimated the importance of this tradition to her, especially during a time of loss. The fact that he dismissed her request and said they don't need to go now because she's not religious could be hurtful, as it might invalidate her feelings about wanting to do this for her family or for closure.\n\nSo, balancing both sides: the author has a right to his beliefs, but maybe he could have found a middle ground. Perhaps attending a shorter service or expressing support in another way. The girlfriend's emotional need to attend church might be valid, and the author's refusal without considering her perspective could be seen as not being fully supportive. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not being considerate enough of her emotional state and the significance of the tradition in her life during this time.\n"
