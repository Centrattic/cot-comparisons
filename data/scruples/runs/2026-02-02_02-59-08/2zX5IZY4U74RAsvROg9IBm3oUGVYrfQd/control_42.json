I'm not at all and she goes every now and then, mostly on xmas and easter. Her family has always been really religious though and she did go to church with them alot when they wanted her to.\n\nHer dad died a couple months ago and it's something that she's been trying to get a handle on. I'm there for her and want to be there for her...at least until she asked me to go to church with her on Easter. Apparently she went on easter with her family every year. She can't fly home for Easter this year and asked me if I could go with her to church. I said no because one, I don't want to sit through the entire service, and two, I don't believe in any of that stuff. I told her that we don't even need to go now seeing as she's not all that religious. It turned into a huge fight about \"traditions\" and now she's crying and sulking. Look, I feel bad, but I just don't see the point. She even said she doesn't really want to go. Am I wrong for not bending my beliefs and refusing church?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not going to church with his girlfriend after her dad died. The situation is that neither he nor his girlfriend are very religious. The girlfriend's family is religious, and she used to go with them. Her dad died, and now she asked him to go to church with her on Easter because it's a tradition. He refused because he doesn't believe in it and doesn't want to sit through the service. She got upset, and they had a big fight.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author isn't religious, which is a personal belief. The girlfriend is also not very religious but comes from a religious family. The request was to attend church as part of a tradition after her father's death. The author says he doesn't want to go because of his beliefs and the fact that they aren't religious. The girlfriend is upset, even though she said she doesn't really want to go either.\n\nSo, the core issue is about respecting each other's feelings and needs in a relationship. Even if the author isn't religious, supporting his girlfriend during her time of grief might require some compromise. The fact that she's trying to connect with a tradition from her family, especially after losing her father, could be significant for her emotionally. The author's refusal might be seen as not supporting her, even if he doesn't share her beliefs. \n\nHowever, the author argues that since neither of them are religious, there's no need to go. But the girlfriend's emotional state and her connection to family traditions might require the author to make an effort. The key here is about being present for her in a way that she finds comforting, regardless of his own beliefs. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might feel that going against his beliefs is a problem. But in relationships, sometimes you have to put aside personal preferences to support your partner. The question is whether refusing to attend church in this context is wrong. If the girlfriend sees it as important, even if she isn't religious, the act of going together could be about her processing grief in her family's way. \n\nThe answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong because not supporting his girlfriend's needs during a difficult time could be seen as not being there for her. Even if he doesn't believe, showing up might mean more to her than the actual church service. The fact that she's upset suggests that his refusal hurt her, which could indicate he should have considered her feelings more. So, the answer might be A (Yes, he's in the wrong).\n"
