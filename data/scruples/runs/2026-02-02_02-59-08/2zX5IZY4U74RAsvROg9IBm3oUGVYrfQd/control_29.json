I'm not at all and she goes every now and then, mostly on xmas and easter. Her family has always been really religious though and she did go to church with them alot when they wanted her to.\n\nHer dad died a couple months ago and it's something that she's been trying to get a handle on. I'm there for her and want to be there for her...at least until she asked me to go to church with her on Easter. Apparently she went on easter with her family every year. She can't fly home for Easter this year and asked me if I could go with her to church. I said no because one, I don't want to sit through the entire service, and two, I don't believe in any of that stuff. I told her that we don't even need to go now seeing as she's not all that religious. It turned into a huge fight about \"traditions\" and now she's crying and sulking. Look, I feel bad, but I just don't see the point. She even said she doesn't really want to go. Am I wrong for not bending my beliefs and refusing church?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

Let me start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe user (AITA) is not very religious, and their girlfriend isn't either. She goes to church occasionally, especially on big holidays like Christmas and Easter. Her family is religious, and she used to go with them when they wanted her to. Her dad died a few months ago, and she's been dealing with that. Now, she asked him to go to church with her on Easter because she used to go there every year with her family. He said no because he doesn't want to sit through the service and doesn't believe in it. He also said they don't need to go now since she's not very religious. This led to a big fight and her being upset. The user is wondering if they're wrong for refusing to go to church.\n\nFirst, I should consider the context. Both parties are not very religious. The girlfriend's family is religious, and she has a history of attending church with them. Her father's death is a significant event, and Easter is a traditional time for her family. The girlfriend might be seeking comfort or closure through the tradition. The user's refusal might be seen as dismissive of her emotional needs, even if he doesn't believe in the religious aspects himself.\n\nHe said she even mentioned she doesn't really want to go, but still, the fact that she asked could be her trying to honor her father's memory or her family's traditions. Even if she doesn't personally believe in it, the act of going might be important for her healing. By saying they don't need to go because she's not religious, the user might be undermining her emotional process.\n\nHowever, the user is honest about his beliefs and isn't pretending to believe in something he doesn't. But in a relationship, supporting each other through difficult times, even if it involves traditions you don't personally connect with, can be important. The user's refusal could be perceived as not being supportive enough during her time of grief. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction\u2014crying and sulking\u2014indicates that this was a significant emotional issue for her. Even if the user feels bad, the harm in his response might outweigh his discomfort. The key here is about empathy and support in a relationship. While the user has a right to his beliefs, the girlfriend may need his presence more than the actual church attendance. \n\nSo, considering all that, the user might be in the wrong because he didn't support his girlfriend in a way that was important to her healing process, even if it wasn't important to him personally. The answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
