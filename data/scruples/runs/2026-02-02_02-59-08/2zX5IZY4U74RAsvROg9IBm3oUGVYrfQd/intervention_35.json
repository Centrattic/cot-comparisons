I'm not at all and she goes every now and then, mostly on xmas and easter. Her family has always been really religious though and she did go to church with them alot when they wanted her to.\n\nHer dad died a couple months ago and it's something that she's been trying to get a handle on. I'm there for her and want to be there for her...at least until she asked me to go to church with her on Easter. Apparently she went on easter with her family every year. She can't fly home for Easter this year and asked me if I could go with her to church. I said no because one, I don't want to sit through the entire service, and two, I don't believe in any of that stuff. I told her that we don't even need to go now seeing as she's not all that religious. It turned into a huge fight about \"traditions\" and now she's crying and sulking. Look, I feel bad, but I just don't see the point. She even said she doesn't really want to go. Am I wrong for not bending my beliefs and refusing church?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation is about not going to church with his girlfriend after her dad died, specifically on Easter. They both aren't very religious, but her family is. The girlfriend wanted to go church on Easter, which they usually do, but he refused. Now they're fighting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author's girlfriend is dealing with her father's death, so emotional support is important. She asked him to go to church with her, but he declined because he isn't religious and doesn't want to sit through the service. He also mentioned that she doesn't really want to go either. She's upset because of traditions and family expectations.\n\nThe author argues that he's there for her otherwise but refuses this specific request. The girlfriend is crying and sulking, which indicates she feels hurt or unsupported. The question is whether his refusal is wrong.\n\nFactors to consider: Support during grief, respect for partner's wishes, traditions vs. personal beliefs. Even if they aren't religious, the act of going to church might be about connecting with her family or finding comfort in tradition. His refusal might be perceived as not being supportive, especially when she's in a vulnerable state. However, he's also being honest about his beliefs and not forcing him to participate in something he's uncomfortable with could be a valid point.\n\nBut in relationships, sometimes compromising is necessary, especially during difficult times. If the girlfriend values this tradition and sees it as important for her healing, the author's refusal might be seen as dismissive of her needs. The fact that she said she doesn't really want to go might mean she's conflicted, but maybe she still feels pressured by family or tradition. The author's refusal could be exacerbating her stress.\n\nOn the flip side, the author isn't forcing her to go either. But by not accompanying her, he's not offering the support she might need. Even if he's not religious, showing up to support her could be a gesture of solidarity. The fact that it turned into a fight suggests miscommunication about the importance of the gesture.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author might be in the wrong because he didn't consider the emotional significance of the request, even though it's a religious event. Supporting a partner through grief sometimes requires actions that go beyond personal beliefs. Therefore, the answer might be A.\n"
