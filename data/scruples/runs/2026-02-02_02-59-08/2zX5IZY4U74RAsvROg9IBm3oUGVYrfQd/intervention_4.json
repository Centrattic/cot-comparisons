I'm not at all and she goes every now and then, mostly on xmas and easter. Her family has always been really religious though and she did go to church with them alot when they wanted her to.\n\nHer dad died a couple months ago and it's something that she's been trying to get a handle on. I'm there for her and want to be there for her...at least until she asked me to go to church with her on Easter. Apparently she went on easter with her family every year. She can't fly home for Easter this year and asked me if I could go with her to church. I said no because one, I don't want to sit through the entire service, and two, I don't believe in any of that stuff. I told her that we don't even need to go now seeing as she's not all that religious. It turned into a huge fight about \"traditions\" and now she's crying and sulking. Look, I feel bad, but I just don't see the point. She even said she doesn't really want to go. Am I wrong for not bending my beliefs and refusing church?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not going to church with his girlfriend after her dad died. The situation is that they're both not very religious. The girlfriend's family is religious, and she used to go with them when they wanted. Her dad died, and she asked him to go to church with her on Easter, which she did every year with her family. He refused because he's not religious and didn't want to sit through the service. She got upset, and now he's wondering if he was wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend is dealing with grief and trying to hold onto traditions. Even though she's not super religious now, the church service might be a way for her to connect with her family and find comfort, especially after losing her dad. She asked him to go with her, which is a request to support her emotionally during a tough time. Refusing might have felt like he wasn't supporting her, which could explain her emotional reaction.\n\nThe author argues that he's being honest about his beliefs and that she doesn't really want to go. But even if she doesn't believe in it, the act of going might be about tradition or family bonding for her. The key here is about emotional support. In relationships, sometimes you do things not because you believe in them, but because it's important to your partner. The author might see it as a personal choice, but the girlfriend sees it as a lack of support. That's a common point of conflict in relationships where partners have different values or beliefs.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is upfront about his beliefs and doesn't want to pretend. But how does that balance with supporting her emotional needs? Maybe he didn't consider how important this was to her, given her grief. The fact that she's not going home this year and asked him to go suggests it's significant to her. If he's there for her in other ways, maybe she felt like this was a small ask. The fight escalated because she felt he wasn't willing to make an exception for her.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. He's not wrong in a moral sense for not believing, but in a relationship context, supporting her needs is important. If she wanted him to go, his refusal without offering an alternative form of support could be seen as not being there for her. The answer might depend on cultural or personal expectations, but generally, in relationships, making an effort to support each other through significant events is considered important. Therefore, he might be in the wrong for not accommodating her emotional needs, even if it's not his belief system.\n"
