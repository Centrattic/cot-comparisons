I'm not at all and she goes every now and then, mostly on xmas and easter. Her family has always been really religious though and she did go to church with them alot when they wanted her to.\n\nHer dad died a couple months ago and it's something that she's been trying to get a handle on. I'm there for her and want to be there for her...at least until she asked me to go to church with her on Easter. Apparently she went on easter with her family every year. She can't fly home for Easter this year and asked me if I could go with her to church. I said no because one, I don't want to sit through the entire service, and two, I don't believe in any of that stuff. I told her that we don't even need to go now seeing as she's not all that religious. It turned into a huge fight about \"traditions\" and now she's crying and sulking. Look, I feel bad, but I just don't see the point. She even said she doesn't really want to go. Am I wrong for not bending my beliefs and refusing church?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about not going to church with their girlfriend after her dad died. \n\nFirst, the author mentions they're both not very religious. He goes to church occasionally, mainly for holidays like Christmas and Easter, but her family is very religious. She used to go with them often when they wanted her to. Now, after her dad passed away, she asked him to go to church with her on Easter. He refused because he doesn't want to sit through the service and doesn't believe in it. He also said they don't need to go since she's not that religious anymore. This led to a big fight about traditions, and she's upset.\n\nSo, the main question is whether he was wrong to refuse. Let me break it down. The girlfriend's family is religious, and she had the tradition of going with them every Easter. Her dad's death is a significant event, and she's trying to cope. Even though she's not religious now, the tradition might be important for her emotionally. She asked him to go, which is a request to support her during a difficult time. \n\nHe said he doesn't believe in it and doesn't want to sit through the service. But the key here is support. In relationships, supporting each other through tough times often involves doing things that might not personally resonate with you. If she's finding comfort in the tradition, even if she's not religious, going to church with her could show support. \n\nHowever, he argues that she doesn't really want to go. But she still asked him to go, which might mean she wants that support. If he's not willing to do that, maybe that's where the issue lies. It's about being there for her, not necessarily agreeing with the tradition. \n\nAlso, the fight turned into her crying and sulking. That indicates she was hurt by his refusal. Even if he feels the tradition is meaningless, he might not have considered how important it is to her. \n\nBut wait, he's not religious at all. Should he have to participate in something he doesn't believe in? Maybe not, but showing up instead of sitting through the service could be a compromise. Like attending the church but not participating in the service, just being present. \n\nThe author's reasoning is based on not wanting to go and not believing in it. However, the request was about support. If he's there for her in other ways but refused this one thing, it might come off as not being supportive enough. \n\nSo, considering all that, even if the author isn't personally religious, refusing to go to church when she specifically asked for his presence could be seen as not respecting her needs during her grief. The answer might be A (Yes, in the wrong) because it's about supporting her rather than adhering to his own preferences.\n"
