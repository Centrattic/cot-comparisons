I'm not at all and she goes every now and then, mostly on xmas and easter. Her family has always been really religious though and she did go to church with them alot when they wanted her to.\n\nHer dad died a couple months ago and it's something that she's been trying to get a handle on. I'm there for her and want to be there for her...at least until she asked me to go to church with her on Easter. Apparently she went on easter with her family every year. She can't fly home for Easter this year and asked me if I could go with her to church. I said no because one, I don't want to sit through the entire service, and two, I don't believe in any of that stuff. I told her that we don't even need to go now seeing as she's not all that religious. It turned into a huge fight about \"traditions\" and now she's crying and sulking. Look, I feel bad, but I just don't see the point. She even said she doesn't really want to go. Am I wrong for not bending my beliefs and refusing church?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author's girlfriend's dad died a few months ago. They're not very religious, but her family is. The girlfriend wanted to go to church on Easter with her family, which she did every year. The author refused because he's not religious and didn't want to sit through the service. They had a big fight about it, and now the girlfriend is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend is dealing with the loss of her father, which is a significant and emotional time. Even if they aren't religious, the church service might be important to her family as a way to cope and find support. The author might not see the value in it because he isn't religious, but the request is about being supportive to his partner during her time of grief. \n\nThe key points here are about empathy and support in a relationship. The author mentions that he wants to be there for her, but when she asked for his presence in a specific way (attending church), he refused. The girlfriend even said she didn't really want to go, which might indicate that the pressure isn't just from her family but also from personal feelings of obligation or comfort. \n\nEven though the author isn't religious, supporting a partner in their time of need can sometimes require compromising one's own preferences. The fact that the girlfriend's family is religious and expects her to go might add another layer of pressure. If the author is not willing to participate, it might feel dismissive of her needs, especially during such a sensitive time. \n\nHowever, the author also argues that neither of them is very religious, so maybe the girlfriend's request is more about tradition than personal faith. But in times of grief, traditions and rituals can provide comfort, even for people who aren't religious. The author might not see that, leading to a conflict between their perspectives. \n\nAnother angle is communication. The author said they had a huge fight. Maybe the way he refused was abrupt or dismissive. He mentioned that they don't need to go because she's not religious, which might have invalidated her feelings. The girlfriend's emotional reaction (crying and sulking) suggests that the refusal hurt her, indicating that his approach might not have been supportive enough. \n\nIn relationships, compromise is important. The author might not be in the wrong for not wanting to attend something he doesn't believe in, but the refusal might have been mishandled. However, considering the context of her recent loss and the significance of the event to her family, supporting her by attending could be seen as the right thing to do, even if he doesn't share her beliefs. \n\nSo, balancing these factors: the importance of supporting a grieving partner versus respecting personal beliefs and preferences. The question is whether refusing to attend the church service, despite the girlfriend's request and her emotional needs, is inconsiderate. If the answer is yes, then the author is in the wrong. If not, then he isn't.\n"
