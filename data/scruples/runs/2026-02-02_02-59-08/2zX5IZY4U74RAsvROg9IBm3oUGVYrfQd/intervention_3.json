I'm not at all and she goes every now and then, mostly on xmas and easter. Her family has always been really religious though and she did go to church with them alot when they wanted her to.\n\nHer dad died a couple months ago and it's something that she's been trying to get a handle on. I'm there for her and want to be there for her...at least until she asked me to go to church with her on Easter. Apparently she went on easter with her family every year. She can't fly home for Easter this year and asked me if I could go with her to church. I said no because one, I don't want to sit through the entire service, and two, I don't believe in any of that stuff. I told her that we don't even need to go now seeing as she's not all that religious. It turned into a huge fight about \"traditions\" and now she's crying and sulking. Look, I feel bad, but I just don't see the point. She even said she doesn't really want to go. Am I wrong for not bending my beliefs and refusing church?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA story is in the wrong for not going to church with their girlfriend after her dad died. The author's girlfriend is only somewhat religious, going to church mainly for big holidays like Christmas and Easter. Her family is more religious, and she used to go with them more often. Her dad recently passed away, and she wanted the author to join her for Easter service this year since she couldn't fly home. The author refused because they don't believe in religion and didn't want to sit through the service. The girlfriend was upset, leading to a fight.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about respecting the girlfriend's emotional needs versus the author's personal beliefs. The author argues that the girlfriend isn't very religious now and doesn't really want to go, but the girlfriend might still want the support from her partner during a difficult time. The author's refusal might be seen as not being supportive enough, even if it's not about religion per se. The girlfriend's request could be about tradition and coping, not strictly about religious belief. So, the author's stance might be coming from a place of honesty about their beliefs, but the girlfriend might feel unsupported. The question is whether respecting her emotional needs outweighs the author's personal beliefs. The user thinks the author is wrong, but I need to consider both sides. The author didn't force them to go, but refusing to accompany her might have been hurtful. Maybe there's a middle ground, like attending part of the service or finding another way to show support. But according to the story, the author said they didn't need to go at all. So, maybe the author is in the wrong for not compromising, even if they don't believe. So, answer A.\n"
