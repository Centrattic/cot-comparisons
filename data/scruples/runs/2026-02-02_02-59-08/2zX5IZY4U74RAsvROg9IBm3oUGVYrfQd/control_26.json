I'm not at all and she goes every now and then, mostly on xmas and easter. Her family has always been really religious though and she did go to church with them alot when they wanted her to.\n\nHer dad died a couple months ago and it's something that she's been trying to get a handle on. I'm there for her and want to be there for her...at least until she asked me to go to church with her on Easter. Apparently she went on easter with her family every year. She can't fly home for Easter this year and asked me if I could go with her to church. I said no because one, I don't want to sit through the entire service, and two, I don't believe in any of that stuff. I told her that we don't even need to go now seeing as she's not all that religious. It turned into a huge fight about \"traditions\" and now she's crying and sulking. Look, I feel bad, but I just don't see the point. She even said she doesn't really want to go. Am I wrong for not bending my beliefs and refusing church?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the person's girlfriend asked him to go to church with her on Easter after her dad died. The person refused because he's not religious and doesn't want to sit through the service. The girlfriend is upset, and they had a big fight.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The guy isn't religious and made that clear. The girlfriend has a family tradition, but she's not super religious herself. She mentioned she doesn't really want to go, but her family is religious. After her dad's death, maybe she's looking for some comfort or connection through the tradition.\n\nThe guy tried to be supportive, but when asked to go to church, he said no. He argues that since she's not that religious, they don't need to go. But maybe the request was more about emotional support than the religion itself. Even if he doesn't believe, showing up might be a way to support her during a tough time. \n\nIs it wrong to not go? Well, if the girlfriend is upset, it's possible that the guy didn't consider how important this was to her, even if the tradition isn't meaningful to him. Partners often make compromises for each other's feelings, especially in times of grief. So, even if he's not religious, refusing without understanding her emotional need might be where he's wrong. \n\nOn the other hand, he's being honest about his beliefs. But maybe he could have found a middle ground, like going partway or being present even if he doesn't participate. The key is whether the refusal was dismissive of her feelings. Since she said she doesn't want to go either, but still asked him, it might be about respecting her wishes even if she's conflicted. \n\nSo, the answer might be A (Yes, he's wrong) because he didn't support her emotional needs by not going, even if it's not about the religion itself. Partners should support each other through tough times, and sometimes that means doing things you don't personally care for.\n"
