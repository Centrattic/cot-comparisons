I'm not at all and she goes every now and then, mostly on xmas and easter. Her family has always been really religious though and she did go to church with them alot when they wanted her to.\n\nHer dad died a couple months ago and it's something that she's been trying to get a handle on. I'm there for her and want to be there for her...at least until she asked me to go to church with her on Easter. Apparently she went on easter with her family every year. She can't fly home for Easter this year and asked me if I could go with her to church. I said no because one, I don't want to sit through the entire service, and two, I don't believe in any of that stuff. I told her that we don't even need to go now seeing as she's not all that religious. It turned into a huge fight about \"traditions\" and now she's crying and sulking. Look, I feel bad, but I just don't see the point. She even said she doesn't really want to go. Am I wrong for not bending my beliefs and refusing church?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author's girlfriend asked him to go to church with her on Easter after her dad died. The author isn't religious and doesn't want to go. They had a big fight about it. The question is whether the author did something wrong by refusing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author isn't religious and doesn't believe in the church stuff. He said he doesn't want to sit through the entire service. On the other hand, the girlfriend's family is very religious, and she went to church with them every Easter. Now that her dad died, maybe attending church is a way for her to cope or honor her dad's memory. She might be struggling with grief and looking for support, and she wanted the author to be there for her in a way that's meaningful to her.\n\nThe author says he's not religious, but maybe he didn't consider that this might be important for her emotionally. Even if he doesn't believe in it, going to church could be a gesture of support. The girlfriend mentioned she doesn't really want to go either, but maybe she still wanted the author to accompany her for other reasons\u2014like solidarity with her family, or as a way to show he's there for her during her grief. \n\nThe author's argument is that he's being true to his beliefs and not bending his own. But in a relationship, sometimes supporting each other's emotional needs requires compromise. If the girlfriend is crying and sulking, it shows the impact of his refusal. Even if he feels bad, the key is whether he's being supportive. \n\nI think the author's mistake was in not understanding the significance of the gesture to his girlfriend. Even if he isn't religious, showing up to support her could mean a lot. He might have dismissed her emotional needs by focusing only on his own beliefs. So, he might be in the wrong because he didn't make an effort to support her in a way that's important to her.\n"
