I'm not at all and she goes every now and then, mostly on xmas and easter. Her family has always been really religious though and she did go to church with them alot when they wanted her to.\n\nHer dad died a couple months ago and it's something that she's been trying to get a handle on. I'm there for her and want to be there for her...at least until she asked me to go to church with her on Easter. Apparently she went on easter with her family every year. She can't fly home for Easter this year and asked me if I could go with her to church. I said no because one, I don't want to sit through the entire service, and two, I don't believe in any of that stuff. I told her that we don't even need to go now seeing as she's not all that religious. It turned into a huge fight about \"traditions\" and now she's crying and sulking. Look, I feel bad, but I just don't see the point. She even said she doesn't really want to go. Am I wrong for not bending my beliefs and refusing church?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not going to church with their girlfriend after her dad died. The situation involves their differing levels of religiosity and the girlfriend's family traditions.\n\nFirst, the author isn't religious at all, and his girlfriend isn't either, except for holidays. Her family is religious, and she used to go with them. Her dad just died, which is a significant emotional event. She wanted to go to church on Easter, which is a big tradition for her family. The author refused because he doesn't believe and doesn't want to sit through the service. The girlfriend seems conflicted too, saying she doesn't really want to go, but the author's refusal led to a fight.\n\nSo, the main points are about respecting her emotional needs and her family's traditions. Even if the author isn't religious, being there for her during a tough time is important. The girlfriend might need the support, not necessarily the religious aspect, but the act of attending with her could show empathy. The author's refusal, even if based on personal beliefs, might be seen as not supporting her during her time of need. The fact that she's crying and sulking shows the impact of his decision. However, the author does mention he's trying to be there for her, but maybe the way he refused was dismissive of her feelings. The key here is balancing personal beliefs with partner's emotional needs. So, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong because he didn't consider her emotional state and the importance of the tradition to her family, even if he's not religious himself.\n"
