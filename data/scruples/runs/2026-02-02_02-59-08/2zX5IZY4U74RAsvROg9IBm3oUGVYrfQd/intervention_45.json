I'm not at all and she goes every now and then, mostly on xmas and easter. Her family has always been really religious though and she did go to church with them alot when they wanted her to.\n\nHer dad died a couple months ago and it's something that she's been trying to get a handle on. I'm there for her and want to be there for her...at least until she asked me to go to church with her on Easter. Apparently she went on easter with her family every year. She can't fly home for Easter this year and asked me if I could go with her to church. I said no because one, I don't want to sit through the entire service, and two, I don't believe in any of that stuff. I told her that we don't even need to go now seeing as she's not all that religious. It turned into a huge fight about \"traditions\" and now she's crying and sulking. Look, I feel bad, but I just don't see the point. She even said she doesn't really want to go. Am I wrong for not bending my beliefs and refusing church?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not going to church with his girlfriend after her dad's death. The situation involves their differing levels of religiosity. The girlfriend's family is very religious, and she went to church sometimes, especially on holidays. Her dad just died, and she wanted to go to Easter church with her family, but the author refused because he's not religious and didn't want to sit through the service. Now there's a fight about traditions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author feels they're being true to themselves and their beliefs. They're not religious, so they don't see the point in pretending or participating in something they don't believe in. On the other hand, the girlfriend might feel that this is important for her emotionally, especially during a time of grief. Even if she's not super religious, the tradition might be a way for her to connect with her family and process her father's death.\n\nThe key points here are empathy, communication, and mutual respect. The author says they want to be there for her, but refusing to go to church might have been a mistake. Even if they don't believe in religion, showing up for her could be a gesture of support. The author's refusal could be seen as dismissing her needs or not valuing her family's traditions, which are important to her. \n\nHowever, the author also has the right to hold their own beliefs. The question is whether they could have found a compromise. Maybe attending part of the service, or finding another way to support her emotionally. The fact that the girlfriend said she doesn't really want to go might be a red flag. Maybe she's conflicted, trying to honor her family while also not wanting to go. The author's refusal might have invalidated her feelings. \n\nIn relationships, sometimes you have to put aside personal preferences to support your partner. The author might have failed in showing that support during a vulnerable time. Even if they don't believe in it, the act of being present can mean a lot. So, I think the author is in the wrong because they didn't fully consider their partner's emotional needs and the importance of the tradition to her family, even if she's not highly religious. Not attending could have been perceived as not being supportive enough.\n"
