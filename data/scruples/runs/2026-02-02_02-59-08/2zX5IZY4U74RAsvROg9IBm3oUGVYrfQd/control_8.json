I'm not at all and she goes every now and then, mostly on xmas and easter. Her family has always been really religious though and she did go to church with them alot when they wanted her to.\n\nHer dad died a couple months ago and it's something that she's been trying to get a handle on. I'm there for her and want to be there for her...at least until she asked me to go to church with her on Easter. Apparently she went on easter with her family every year. She can't fly home for Easter this year and asked me if I could go with her to church. I said no because one, I don't want to sit through the entire service, and two, I don't believe in any of that stuff. I told her that we don't even need to go now seeing as she's not all that religious. It turned into a huge fight about \"traditions\" and now she's crying and sulking. Look, I feel bad, but I just don't see the point. She even said she doesn't really want to go. Am I wrong for not bending my beliefs and refusing church?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this AITA question. So, the user is asking if they're in the wrong for not going to church with their girlfriend after her dad died. They both aren't very religious. The girlfriend goes sometimes, especially for holidays like Christmas and Easter, but her family is super religious. The key event is the girlfriend wanted to go to church on Easter, which was a tradition she had with her family every year. The user refused because he doesn't believe in it and didn't want to sit through the service. The girlfriend was upset, leading to a big fight about traditions. The user is wondering if they're wrong for not bending their beliefs.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The girlfriend is trying to cope with her dad's death, which is a big deal. She might be looking for comfort or a way to honor her dad, especially if church was a tradition. The user's refusal might be seen as not supporting her during a tough time. Even though they aren't religious, showing up might be more about being there for her emotionally rather than the religious aspect. The user did say they don't need to go because she's not that religious now, but she still asked, maybe for emotional support. \n\nOn the other hand, the user has his own beliefs and isn't religious. Forcing oneself to attend something one doesn't believe in could be seen as disingenuous. But in relationships, sometimes you have to make compromises for your partner, especially during difficult times. The user's reasoning is valid, but the impact on the girlfriend is significant. The fact that she was crying and sulking suggests she felt hurt or unsupported. \n\nSo, the question is about balancing personal beliefs with supporting a partner. The user might not be in the wrong because they are honest about their beliefs, but they might have failed to see the emotional need behind the request. It's possible the girlfriend wanted the presence, not necessarily the religious service. The user could have offered an alternative way to support her. Maybe a compromise, like going for a walk or another activity she'd find comforting. \n\nIn some cases, people might think the user should have gone to show support, even if they don't share the beliefs. Others might say it's okay to stick to one's principles. The key here is the girlfriend's emotional state and the user's willingness to be there for her. The user's refusal might be seen as selfish in this context. However, if the user had a valid reason and communicated it clearly but the girlfriend still feels hurt, it's a nuanced situation. \n\nI think the answer depends on the perspective. If the user is respecting the girlfriend's needs, even if it's not their own preference, they might be in the right. But if the refusal was dismissive of her emotional needs, then they might be in the wrong. The user did try to be supportive in other ways, but maybe not enough in this specific instance. The tradition angle is important here, as it's a significant cultural aspect of her family. \n\nIn conclusion, the user might not be entirely in the wrong because they are truthful about their beliefs, but they could have handled it better by finding another way to support her. However, since the girlfriend was upset and this was a meaningful tradition for her, some might argue the user should have gone despite their beliefs. So, the answer might be A (in the wrong) because they didn't compromise and it caused hurt feelings, even if their reasoning is understandable.\n"
