I'm not at all and she goes every now and then, mostly on xmas and easter. Her family has always been really religious though and she did go to church with them alot when they wanted her to.\n\nHer dad died a couple months ago and it's something that she's been trying to get a handle on. I'm there for her and want to be there for her...at least until she asked me to go to church with her on Easter. Apparently she went on easter with her family every year. She can't fly home for Easter this year and asked me if I could go with her to church. I said no because one, I don't want to sit through the entire service, and two, I don't believe in any of that stuff. I told her that we don't even need to go now seeing as she's not all that religious. It turned into a huge fight about \"traditions\" and now she's crying and sulking. Look, I feel bad, but I just don't see the point. She even said she doesn't really want to go. Am I wrong for not bending my beliefs and refusing church?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not going to church with his girlfriend after her dad died. \n\nFirst, the context: Both aren't very religious. The girlfriend goes sometimes, mostly for holidays. Her family is religious, and she used to go with them. Her dad died a few months ago, and she's trying to cope. She asked him to go to Easter church with her this year because she couldn't fly home. He refused, saying he doesn't want to sit through the service and doesn't believe. They fought about traditions, and she's upset.\n\nSo, the user is asking if he's in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nHmm. Let me break it down. The key points here are about respect in a relationship, especially when dealing with grief and cultural/religious traditions. The girlfriend is dealing with her father's death, and maybe church was a way for her to connect with her family's traditions or find comfort. She asked him to join her, which is a request for support in her grieving process. \n\nHe says he's not religious and doesn't want to sit through the service. But even if he's not religious, attending the service with her could be a gesture of support. She might not want to go herself, but she asked him anyway, perhaps to honor her father or her family's traditions. If he refused, maybe he's not respecting her emotional needs during a tough time. \n\nOn the other hand, he's not religious, so forcing himself to attend might be a conflict of his beliefs. But in relationships, compromise is often expected. The fact that she even asked shows she values his presence, even if she's not super religious. \n\nBut wait, he said she mentioned she doesn't want to go. So maybe she's conflicted. But she still asked him to go, which might mean she wanted him to support her in that choice. If he refused, he might be dismissing her emotional request for support. \n\nAlso, the fact that they fought about it and she's crying and sulking suggests that this was important to her. Even if he doesn't see the point, his refusal might have hurt her feelings. In a relationship, supporting each other's emotional needs, even if you don't understand them, is usually considered important. \n\nSo, even if he's not religious, attending church as a gesture of support could be seen as the right thing to do. Refusing might be seen as not being there for her when she needs him. Therefore, he might be in the wrong. \n\nBut maybe there's a middle ground. Like attending part of the service or explaining his discomfort in a more empathetic way. However, the way he refused (\"we don't even need to go now\") might come off as dismissive. \n\nIn conclusion, while he has his own beliefs, in a relationship, showing up for your partner's emotional needs, especially during grief, is typically considered important. So the answer might be A (he is in the wrong).\n"
