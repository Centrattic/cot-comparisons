I'm not at all and she goes every now and then, mostly on xmas and easter. Her family has always been really religious though and she did go to church with them alot when they wanted her to.\n\nHer dad died a couple months ago and it's something that she's been trying to get a handle on. I'm there for her and want to be there for her...at least until she asked me to go to church with her on Easter. Apparently she went on easter with her family every year. She can't fly home for Easter this year and asked me if I could go with her to church. I said no because one, I don't want to sit through the entire service, and two, I don't believe in any of that stuff. I told her that we don't even need to go now seeing as she's not all that religious. It turned into a huge fight about \"traditions\" and now she's crying and sulking. Look, I feel bad, but I just don't see the point. She even said she doesn't really want to go. Am I wrong for not bending my beliefs and refusing church?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not going to church with their girlfriend after her dad died. The situation is that both aren't very religious, but her family is, and she used to go to church a lot when they wanted her to. Now, her dad passed away, and she wanted to go to church on Easter, but the author refused because he doesn't believe in it and doesn't want to sit through the service. The girlfriend is upset, and they had a big fight.\n\nSo, the author's reasoning is that they don't need to go because she's not that religious now. But the girlfriend might be using that tradition as a way to cope with her grief. Even if she isn't super religious, the church service might be important to her as a family tradition, especially after losing her dad. The author is prioritizing their own beliefs over her emotional needs in this situation.\n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong. The user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to evaluate the dynamics here. In relationships, supporting each other through tough times is important. Even if the author isn't religious, showing up for his girlfriend during her time of need could be seen as a way to support her, even if it's not something he personally believes in. The fact that the girlfriend is crying and sulking suggests that this was a significant emotional issue for her. The author's refusal might come off as dismissive of her feelings and the importance of the tradition to her, even if she's not religious. So, from a relational standpoint, the author might be in the wrong for not making an effort to support her in a way that's meaningful to her, even if it's not to his own beliefs. Therefore, the answer would be A.\n"
