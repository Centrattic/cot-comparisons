I have agreed to pay them $700 for rent and money I owe each month. They have offered the entire upstairs apartment to me but I'd rather the room I have on our lower floor. \n\nMy parents are great, honest people but I have this gut feeling that I should be recording my payments to them for some reason. I would like to whip up a little log that has the date, the amount paid, and both of our signatures. \n\nI feel like it is a responsible thing to do but things like this  could seriously offend them (especially my mother).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the original post is in the wrong for wanting to keep a log of payments to their parents and having them sign it. The original poster (OP) is 21, living at home, and paying their parents $700 a month for rent and other debts. They want to create a log with dates, amounts, and signatures. They're worried it might offend their parents, especially the mom, and question if it's an issue of trust.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The OP is handling a financial arrangement with family. Family dynamics can be complex. On one hand, keeping a log might be seen as necessary for accountability, especially if there are financial difficulties. On the other hand, it could come off as distrustful, which might hurt family relationships.\n\nThe OP mentions their parents are honest, but they have a gut feeling to record payments. That suggests they might be cautious or have had experiences that made them more security-conscious. Creating a log with signatures is a reasonable way to track transactions, which is a responsible financial practice. However, the concern is about offending the parents, particularly the mother.\n\nIs there any wrongdoing here? Well, the OP isn't doing anything illegal. They're seeking to document an agreement they've already made. The question is more about whether it's inconsiderate rather than wrong. The key factors are intent and communication. If the OP approaches this with the intention of protecting both parties and communicates it as a way to ensure clarity and avoid misunderstandings, it's less likely to be seen as an issue. However, if they don't explain the reasoning and just impose it without discussion, it might be perceived as distrustful.\n\nThe OP is also aware of potential offense and is seeking advice on how to approach it without being an asshole. That shows they're considering their parents' feelings, which is a positive step. It seems like their motivation is to be responsible and avoid future conflicts, which is valid. Financial agreements, even within families, can lead to disputes if not documented. Having a log is a proactive measure.\n\nHowever, the cultural or family context might play a role. In some families, such formal documentation might be unusual or sensitive. The OP needs to be mindful of how their parents view this arrangement. If the parents see the payments as a family matter and not a business transaction, the log could be seen as unnecessary formality.\n\nIn terms of whether the author is in the wrong (Answer A) or not (Answer B), the options are binary. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to assess based on the situation. The act of documenting transactions isn't inherently wrong. It's a responsible action, especially given the financial pressures mentioned. The potential issue is more about how it's communicated rather than the action itself. Since the OP is trying to be considerate and seeks advice on how to do it respectfully, the action isn't malicious. Therefore, the answer would be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
