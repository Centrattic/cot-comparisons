I have agreed to pay them $700 for rent and money I owe each month. They have offered the entire upstairs apartment to me but I'd rather the room I have on our lower floor. \n\nMy parents are great, honest people but I have this gut feeling that I should be recording my payments to them for some reason. I would like to whip up a little log that has the date, the amount paid, and both of our signatures. \n\nI feel like it is a responsible thing to do but things like this  could seriously offend them (especially my mother). In a way I feel as if it chips at the trust and honesty that we are trying to maintain. How should I go about this without being an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the \"Will I Be The Asshole\" post is wrong for wanting to keep a log of payments to their parents and have them sign it. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The person is 21, paying their parents $700 a month for rent and money owed. They want to create a log with dates, amounts, and signatures. They're worried it might offend their parents, especially the mother, and feel it's responsible but might damage trust.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the person is taking a responsible step by documenting payments, which is common in formal agreements. However, they're concerned about how this might be perceived by their family. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFinancial transparency can be seen as a good practice. When dealing with money, especially in a family setting, having records helps prevent misunderstandings. The author isn't doing anything illegal or unethical; they're ensuring accountability. However, the family dynamics might be strained because their parents might feel distrusted. \n\nBut the author isn't wrong for wanting to protect their financial records. They might be in a situation where they need proof of payments, maybe for tax purposes or in case of disputes. The act of creating a log isn't inherently wrong. The way they approach their parents could matter. If they explain the reason calmly and frame it as a mutual benefit (like keeping track to avoid confusion), it might be better received. \n\nThe alternative is that the parents might feel the child is accusing them of dishonesty, which is a valid concern. But the author's intention is to maintain responsibility, not to distrust. So, the answer would be that the author isn't in the wrong. They have a valid reason to keep a log. The potential issue is more about communication than the action itself.\n"
