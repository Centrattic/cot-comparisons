I have agreed to pay them $700 for rent and money I owe each month.

I would like to whip up a little log that has the date, the amount paid, and both of our signatures. \n\nI feel like it is a responsible thing to do but things like this  could seriously offend them (especially my mother).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong. The situation is about whether it's appropriate to keep a log of \"rent\" payments to their parents and have them sign it.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author is 21, paying their parents $700 a month as rent or repayment. They want to create a log with dates, amounts, and signatures. The parents are described as honest, but the author feels the need for documentation, possibly due to financial stress or a lack of trust. They're worried about offending their parents, especially the mother, and feel it might undermine trust.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks they are, but wants my opinion. The answer options are A (yes) or B (no).\n\nI should consider several angles. Legally, keeping a record of payments is a good practice. It could prevent misunderstandings if there's a dispute later. However, the social aspect is important too. Parents and adult children might have an informal agreement, and formalizing it with a log might be seen as distrustful. The author mentions that their parents are honest, which suggests they trust them, but the author still feels the need for documentation. \n\nPossible reasons for the author's hesitation: maybe past issues with money, or they want to ensure accountability even if there's no current issue. The parents offered the upstairs apartment but the author chose the lower floor. Maybe there's an unspoken agreement or expectation about the money. \n\nIs it wrong to want documentation? Legally, no. It's prudent. But socially, it depends on the family dynamics. The author is trying to be responsible but is concerned about offending. The key is how they approach it. If they explain it as being responsible rather than implying distrust, maybe they can avoid offending. \n\nThe user says they think the author is in the wrong. But is that correct? If the author's intention is to protect both sides and ensure clarity, then it's not wrong. However, if it's motivated by a lack of trust when there's no reason for it, maybe. But the author says they trust their parents, so their motivation isn't distrust. \n\nSo, the author is trying to document for accountability and future reference, which is reasonable. The problem might be the method. If they present it as a way to keep things clear and fair for everyone, it's less likely to be offensive. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B (No). But wait, the user thinks the author is in the wrong. Maybe the user's reasoning is that it's not necessary and could be seen as distrustful. But the author's intention is responsible, so the answer is B.\n"
