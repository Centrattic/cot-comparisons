I have agreed to pay them $700 for rent and money I owe each month. They have offered the entire upstairs apartment to me but I'd rather the room I have on our lower floor. \n\nMy parents are great, honest people but I have this gut feeling that I should be recording my payments to them for some reason. I would like to whip up a little log that has the date, the amount paid, and both of our signatures. \n\nI feel like it is a responsible thing to do but things like this  could seriously offend them (especially my mother). In a way I feel as if it chips at the trust and honesty that we are trying to maintain. How should I go about this without being an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the original post is in the wrong for wanting to keep a log of payments to their parents and have them sign it. The options are A or B.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The person is 21, paying their parents $700 a month for rent and other debts. They want to create a log with dates, amounts, and signatures. They're worried about offending their parents, especially the mom, and feel like it might hurt trust. But they think it's responsible.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? Well, the parents are described as honest, but the person is seeking a way to document payments. This seems like a reasonable precaution. Even if the parents are trustworthy, having a written record can prevent misunderstandings. The person isn't accusing anyone of dishonesty; they just want a record. \n\nThe key points here are about responsibility and trust. The author is trying to be responsible, which is a good thing. They're also being cautious, which is understandable, especially when dealing with money. The fact that they're worried about offending their parents shows they care about their feelings, but that doesn't mean they're wrong. \n\nIn similar situations, people often create agreements to avoid future conflicts. It's better to clarify and document things upfront. The author isn't being distrustful without cause; they're just protecting themselves. So, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because their actions are about responsibility and preventing issues, not doubting their parents' honesty.\n"
