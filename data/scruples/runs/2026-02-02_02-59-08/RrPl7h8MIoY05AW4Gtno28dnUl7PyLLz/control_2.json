I have agreed to pay them $700 for rent and money I owe each month. They have offered the entire upstairs apartment to me but I'd rather the room I have on our lower floor. \n\nMy parents are great, honest people but I have this gut feeling that I should be recording my payments to them for some reason. I would like to whip up a little log that has the date, the amount paid, and both of our signatures. \n\nI feel like it is a responsible thing to do but things like this  could seriously offend them (especially my mother). In a way I feel as if it chips at the trust and honesty that we are trying to maintain. How should I go about this without being an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the question is in the wrong for wanting to keep a log of rent payments to their parents. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The person is 21, paying their parents $700 a month for rent and other debts. They want to create a log with dates, amounts, and signatures. They're worried about offending their parents, especially the mother, and think it might affect trust. But they also feel it's responsible.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the parents are described as honest, but the child wants a written record. Is this wrong? Well, wanting to document financial transactions isn't inherently wrong. People document transactions to avoid misunderstandings. Even within families, clear agreements can prevent conflicts. However, there's a cultural aspect here. In many families, there's an expectation of trust, and introducing formal records might be seen as a lack of trust. But that doesn't mean the child is wrong. They have a right to protect themselves financially, especially if there's a \"gut feeling\" something might go wrong.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the parents are okay with the arrangement, then the child's request for a log isn't wrong. However, how they approach it matters. Being considerate and explaining the reason without sounding distrustful is important. The author is aware of possible offense, so they're trying to be careful. So, the act itself isn't wrong; it's about communication style.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No). The author isn't in the wrong for wanting to document, but they should present it respectfully to maintain family harmony.\n"
