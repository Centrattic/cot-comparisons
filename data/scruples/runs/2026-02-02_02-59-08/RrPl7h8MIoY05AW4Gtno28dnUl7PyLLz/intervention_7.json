I have agreed to pay them $700 for rent and money I owe each month. They have offered the entire upstairs apartment to me but I'd rather the room I have on our lower floor. \n\nMy parents are great, honest people but I have this gut feeling that I should be recording my payments to them for some reason. I would like to whip up a little log that has the date, the amount paid, and both of our signatures. \n\nI feel like it is a responsible thing to do but things like this  could seriously offend them (especially my mother). In a way I feel as if it chips at the trust and honesty that we are trying to maintain. How should I go about this without being an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong for wanting to keep a log of payments to their parents and asking them to sign it. The author is 21, paying $700 a month to their parents for rent and other money owed. They want to create a log with dates, amounts, and signatures to record these payments. The parents are described as honest, but the author is worried it might offend them, especially the mother, and feels it could undermine trust.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is an adult, so financial independence is important. However, they're still living with their parents. The payments are agreed upon, but the author is concerned about recording them. On one hand, creating a log is a way to ensure clarity and avoid misunderstandings, which is responsible. On the other hand, the parents might see it as a lack of trust, which could strain family relations.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that they have a \"gut feeling\" something might go wrong, so documenting payments is prudent. But they're worried about appearing distrustful. The key points are: is the log necessary, and is it respectful? If the family has agreed to the payments, maybe verbal or informal, the author might be trying to formalize it, which is common in business contexts but less so in family matters. However, in some cases, especially where there's a significant amount of money involved, having a record can prevent disputes later.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the parents are honest and the author's intention is just to keep track, then it's not inherently wrong. The issue is how it's approached. The author wants to avoid being an \"asshole,\" so maybe the way they present the log is important. But the act of keeping a log itself isn't unethical. The concern is about trust and family dynamics. The author is trying to balance responsibility with maintaining family harmony.\n\nIn some cultures or family situations, documenting such payments might be normal. In others, it could be seen as cold or distrustful. The author is aware of this and is seeking a way to do it without offending. So, the answer might hinge on whether the action is reasonable or if it's an overstep. Since the author is an adult and the payments are significant, having a log is a responsible action. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to do this. They are taking proactive steps to manage their finances, which is a mature approach. The potential issue is the method of communication rather than the act itself. So the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
