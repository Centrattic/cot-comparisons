I would like to whip up a little log that has the date, the amount paid, and both of our signatures. \n\nI feel like it is a responsible thing to do but things like this  could seriously offend them (especially my mother).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the person is 21 and paying their parents $700 a month for rent and other debts. They want to start a log with signatures to track payments. The parents might be offended, and the person is worried about trust and honesty.\n\nFirst, the author's intention is to be responsible. They want a record to avoid disputes, which makes sense, especially if there's a financial arrangement. But they're concerned about offending their parents, especially the mom. The question is whether they're wrong for wanting this.\n\nWell, the parents offered the apartment but the author chose a different room. The payments are part of an agreement, right? So if there's a verbal agreement, sometimes things can get forgotten or disputed. Having a written log isn't necessarily bad. It's a way to protect both sides. But family dynamics can make this touchy. \n\nThe author is worried about trust. They mention that their parents are honest, so maybe the parents don't see the need for a log. But the author's right to want clarity isn't wrong. It's about mutual understanding. If the author approaches it respectfully, explaining it's for everyone's peace of mind, it shouldn't be an issue. But if they just present it as a demand, that could be seen as mistrust. \n\nSo, the key here is the approach. The author isn't in the wrong for wanting to document the payments. The problem might be how they present it. The answer is B (No), because the author is being responsible and it's reasonable to have a record, as long as it's communicated well. They're not being an asshole if they frame it correctly. The parents might feel it's unnecessary, but the author's intent is to be fair, not to distrust.\n"
