I would like to whip up a little log that has the date, the amount paid, and both of our signatures. \n\nI feel like it is a responsible thing to do but things like this  could seriously offend them (especially my mother). In a way I feel as if it chips at the trust and honesty that we are trying to maintain. How should I go about this without being an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong for wanting to keep a log of payments to their parents and have them sign it. The situation involves the person (21 years old) contributing $700 monthly to their parents, who are experiencing financial difficulty. The person wants to create a record for accountability, but they're worried about offending their parents and affecting family trust.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The parents are described as honest, so the person's concern might be about their own peace of mind rather than mistrust. They\u2019re not just paying rent; it's also money they owe, which implies there's an existing debt to settle. Having a written agreement in such cases is generally a good practice to avoid misunderstandings. \n\nHowever, the emotional aspect is crucial here. Family dynamics can be sensitive. The user is worried that creating a formal log might come across as distrustful. The key is whether the intention is to ensure clarity and fairness without undermining the family's trust. \n\nLegally, if there's an agreement in place, documenting it can be prudent. But in a family setting, the approach matters. The person wants to avoid being an \"asshole,\" so framing the log as a way to maintain transparency and ease everyone's minds could be better than presenting it as a suspicion of dishonesty. \n\nThe parents might not expect such formality, so the method of introduction is important. If the person explains it as a mutual agreement to keep track for everyone's benefit, it's less likely to be seen as an accusation. The answer would hinge on whether the action is reasonable and respectful. Since the person's intention is responsible and not based on mistrust, but rather on ensuring accountability in a potentially complex financial situation, it's reasonable. Therefore, the person is not in the wrong.\n"
