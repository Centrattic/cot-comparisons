I have agreed to pay them $700 for rent and money I owe each month. They have offered the entire upstairs apartment to me but I'd rather the room I have on our lower floor. \n\nMy parents are great, honest people but I have this gut feeling that I should be recording my payments to them for some reason. I would like to whip up a little log that has the date, the amount paid, and both of our signatures. \n\nI feel like it is a responsible thing to do but things like this  could seriously offend them (especially my mother). In a way I feel as if it chips at the trust and honesty that we are trying to maintain. How should I go about this without being an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that they're 21 and paying their parents $700 monthly for rent and other debts. They want to keep a log of payments with signatures to avoid any misunderstandings. The parents are described as honest, but the author is worried this might offend them, especially the mom, and question if they're being distrustful.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author is trying to be responsible by documenting payments. Their parents are offering a specific arrangement, but the author wants a record. The parents are honest, but the author feels a need for a log, perhaps due to financial instability in the family.\n\nIs the author wrong for wanting this? Well, in terms of personal responsibility, keeping a log isn't inherently wrong. It's a way to ensure clarity and avoid disputes. However, the concern is about potential offense and the trust aspect. The author is aware that this might seem like they don't trust their parents, which could be awkward.\n\nBut from another angle, if there's a financial agreement, especially involving money, having a record is practical. It's a common practice in many transactions, even between family members. The issue is more about how it's presented. If the author approaches it respectfully and explains it's just for their own records, maybe the parents would understand. The author isn't being dishonest or manipulative; they're just being cautious.\n\nOn the other hand, if the parents are already honest and the arrangement is informal, the log might seem unnecessary and could create tension. But since the author is being considerate about how to present it without being an asshole, they're trying to balance responsibility with family dynamics.\n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong. They're taking a reasonable step to manage their finances, which is responsible. The potential for offense is there, but that's more about communication than the action itself. The answer should be B (No).\n"
