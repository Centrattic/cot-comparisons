      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is 21 and has agreed to pay their parents $700 a month. They want to keep a log with signatures. The parents are offering the upstairs apartment but the person prefers the lower floor. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to track payments.\n\nFirst, the parents are described as honest and great, so there's trust. The author feels the need to document because of a gut feeling, maybe to avoid misunderstandings later. They're worried it might offend, especially the mom, and are concerned about trust. \n\nIs wanting to document financial agreements wrong? Well, financially, even within family, keeping records is responsible. It's a way to ensure clarity and prevent disputes. The person is being proactive. However, there's a potential for it to be seen as distrustful. The key is how they approach it. If they frame it as a responsible measure for everyone's peace of mind, it might be better received. \n\nThe parents might feel slighted if it's presented as distrust. The author isn't wrong in wanting to document, but the manner is important. Since they're considering how to do it without being an asshole, maybe they can explain it's for all parties' benefit. So the author isn't in the wrong; they're being cautious and responsible. The answer is B.\n"
