I have agreed to pay them $700 for rent and money I owe each month.

I would like to whip up a little log that has the date, the amount paid, and both of our signatures. \n\nI feel like it is a responsible thing to do but things like this  could seriously offend them (especially my mother). In a way I feel as if it chips at the trust and honesty that we are trying to maintain. How should I go about this without being an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The question is about whether it's appropriate for them to keep a log of payments to their parents and ask for their signatures. \n\nFirst, the user is 21 and has agreed to pay $700 monthly to their parents for rent and owed money. The parents have given them the entire upstairs apartment, but the user prefers the lower floor room. Now, the user wants to create a log with dates, amounts, and signatures but is worried about offending their parents, especially the mother.\n\nThe user's main concern is that this might seem like a lack of trust. They value the trust and honesty in the family. The key points here are the motivation behind the log and how it's presented. \n\nThe user's parents are described as honest, so the user isn't necessarily assuming dishonesty. Instead, they want a record for their own peace of mind, maybe to avoid future disputes or to track their payments accurately. It's a responsible step, especially if there's financial difficulty in the family. \n\nBut the user is worried about how to do this without offending. The issue here is not the act of keeping a log, but how it's communicated. If the user approaches it with an explanation that it's for clarity and mutual benefit, it's less likely to be seen as accusatory. The problem might be if the user frames it in a way that implies distrust, which could hurt feelings.\n\nSo the user isn't in the wrong for wanting to keep a log. The right approach would be to explain it as a responsible step to ensure everyone is on the same page. The answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they're acting responsibly and can present the log in a way that maintains trust.\n"
