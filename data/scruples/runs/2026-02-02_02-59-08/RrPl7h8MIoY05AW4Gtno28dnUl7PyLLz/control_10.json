I have agreed to pay them $700 for rent and money I owe each month. They have offered the entire upstairs apartment to me but I'd rather the room I have on our lower floor. \n\nMy parents are great, honest people but I have this gut feeling that I should be recording my payments to them for some reason. I would like to whip up a little log that has the date, the amount paid, and both of our signatures. \n\nI feel like it is a responsible thing to do but things like this  could seriously offend them (especially my mother). In a way I feel as if it chips at the trust and honesty that we are trying to maintain. How should I go about this without being an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the original question is in the wrong for wanting to keep a payment log and ask their parents to sign it.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The person is 21, paying their parents $700 a month for rent and past debts. They want to create a log with dates, amounts, and signatures. They're worried it might offend their parents, especially their mom, and question if it's a breach of trust.\n\nSo, the key points are: the parents are described as honest, but the person feels the need for a record. The motivation is being responsible, but they're concerned about offending their parents. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nHmm. Well, in financial matters between family members, even among adults, it's common to have some form of record to avoid misunderstandings. The person is trying to be responsible, which is a positive trait. However, the parents might feel that such a formal arrangement isn't necessary because of the existing trust. The author is worried about offending them, which suggests they value the relationship.\n\nBut is the author wrong? Probably not. They're trying to protect their interests while also acknowledging their parents' honesty. The key here is balance. The author isn't doing anything unethical; they're just creating a document to ensure clarity. The parents might take it as a lack of trust, but that's more about their perception than the author's intent. The author's approach is reasonable, especially given the financial strain mentioned. It's about protecting themselves, which is prudent. So, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
