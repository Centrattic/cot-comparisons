I have agreed to pay them $700 for rent and money I owe each month. They have offered the entire upstairs apartment to me but I'd rather the room I have on our lower floor. \n\nMy parents are great, honest people but I have this gut feeling that I should be recording my payments to them for some reason. I would like to whip up a little log that has the date, the amount paid, and both of our signatures. \n\nI feel like it is a responsible thing to do but things like this  could seriously offend them (especially my mother). In a way I feel as if it chips at the trust and honesty that we are trying to maintain. How should I go about this without being an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the Ask Me Anything (AMA) post is in the wrong for wanting to keep a log of their payments to their parents and get their signatures. The options are A or B. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The person is 21, paying their parents $700 a month for rent and other debts. They want to create a log with dates, amounts, and signatures. They're worried it might offend their parents, especially their mom, and they're concerned about trust.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, they're trying to be responsible by documenting payments. The parents are described as honest, but maybe there's a financial strain. The author's motivation is to ensure transparency and avoid misunderstandings. \n\nBut why would they be in the wrong? If the parents are okay with the arrangement, maybe the author is overstepping by requiring signatures. However, the author isn't necessarily forcing them; they just want a record. The parents might see it as distrust, but if the author is concerned about their own record-keeping, it's a legitimate need, especially if there's a possibility of disputes later. \n\nIn many rental situations, written agreements are standard. Even within family, having a record can prevent conflicts. The author isn't being confrontational; they're just being proactive. The parents might be upset if they feel it's unnecessary, but the author's intent is to be responsible, not to distrust. \n\nSo, the answer is probably B. The author isn't in the wrong for wanting a written log. They're protecting themselves without implying dishonesty. It's a reasonable step, especially in a financially strained household.\n"
