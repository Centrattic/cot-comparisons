I have agreed to pay them $700 for rent and money I owe each month. They have offered the entire upstairs apartment to me but I'd rather the room I have on our lower floor. \n\nMy parents are great, honest people but I have this gut feeling that I should be recording my payments to them for some reason. I would like to whip up a little log that has the date, the amount paid, and both of our signatures. \n\nI feel like it is a responsible thing to do but things like this  could seriously offend them (especially my mother).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the original post (OP) is in the wrong for wanting to keep a log of payments to their parents and getting them to sign. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The OP is 21, and their family is going through financial difficulties. They've agreed to pay $700 monthly to their parents for rent and owed money. They want to create a log with dates, amounts, and signatures. They're worried about offending their parents, especially the mother, and feel it might undermine trust.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants others' opinions. The task is to decide if the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B).\n\nLet me break this down. The key points are the OP's intention to document payments, the context of financial strain, and the concern about trust and family dynamics. \n\nIn many cases, when dealing with financial agreements between family members, especially when there's a power dynamic (like parent and child), it's common for one party to feel the need for documentation to protect themselves. The OP is being proactive by wanting a written record. However, the parent's perspective is also important. They might feel that this documentation is unnecessary or implies distrust, which could cause tension.\n\nBut is the OP in the wrong? Well, the intention here is responsibility and clarity. The OP isn't withholding money or acting out of distrust; they're trying to ensure both sides are clear on the agreement. Financial transparency can be a good thing, especially when money is involved. However, the manner in which they approach it is crucial. If they frame it as a mutual agreement and explain it as a way to help everyone stay organized, it might prevent offense. \n\nHowever, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The act of wanting to document the payments isn't inherently wrong. The problem could be in how it's communicated. If the OP approaches it in a way that feels accusatory or distrustful, that could be the issue. But the OP is already considering this and is looking for ways to do it without being an asshole. \n\nIn many cases, documentation is a responsible action. The OP is not wrong for wanting to protect themselves financially. Families often have informal agreements, but when money is involved, especially in times of financial stress, having a record can prevent misunderstandings. The parents might not be used to such formality, but the OP is trying to be respectful by seeking signatures, which shows a desire for mutual agreement rather than unilateral action.\n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong. They're taking a responsible step to manage their finances and ensure clarity. The potential issue is more about how it's presented rather than the action itself. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
