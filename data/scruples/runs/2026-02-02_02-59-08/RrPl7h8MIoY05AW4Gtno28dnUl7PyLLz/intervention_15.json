I have agreed to pay them $700 for rent and money I owe each month. They have offered the entire upstairs apartment to me but I'd rather the room I have on our lower floor. \n\nMy parents are great, honest people but I have this gut feeling that I should be recording my payments to them for some reason. I would like to whip up a little log that has the date, the amount paid, and both of our signatures. \n\nI feel like it is a responsible thing to do but things like this  could seriously offend them (especially my mother).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the original post (OP) is in the wrong for wanting to keep a log of payments to their parents.\n\nFirst, OP is 21 and has agreed to pay their parents $700 monthly for rent and other debts. They want to create a log with dates, amounts, and signatures. They're worried about offending their parents, especially the mother, and feel it might undermine trust.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to decide. Let me consider the possible angles. On one hand, the parents are offering the upstairs apartment, but OP prefers the lower floor. The payment arrangement is agreed upon. Creating a log with signatures isn't necessarily about distrust but about documentation. It's a way to ensure clarity and avoid future disputes, especially since the family is going through financial issues. Maybe the parents are honest, but OP is being cautious, which is understandable.\n\nOn the other hand, there's the aspect of family trust. Asking for signatures might come off as treating parents like business partners, which could be hurtful. The parents might feel that their honesty is being questioned. OP is trying to avoid being an asshole, so they're sensitive to this.\n\nBut is it wrong to want documentation? If there's an agreement, documenting it isn't inherently wrong. It's a form of responsibility. However, how it's approached matters. If OP can explain it as a way to keep things clear and avoid misunderstandings, maybe it's not about distrust. The key here is the intent behind the action. If the intent is to protect both sides, then it's reasonable. If it's perceived as distrust, that's where the problem might be.\n\nFinancial agreements within families can be tricky. Sometimes documentation is necessary to prevent future conflicts. Given the financial struggles mentioned, having a written record might actually help if there's ever a discrepancy. However, the method of implementation is crucial. Approaching it as a team effort, ensuring that both parties agree to the log, and framing it as a responsible step rather than a sign of distrust could mitigate any hurt feelings.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the author's intention is purely to maintain clarity and responsibility without implying distrust, then maybe not. But if it's done in a way that disregards the parents' feelings, then perhaps. The question is whether the action itself is wrong, regardless of intent. Since the author is trying to be responsible and is aware of possible offense, but is taking steps to approach it carefully, it's more about how it's communicated rather than the act itself. Therefore, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because seeking documentation is a responsible action, even within a family context, as long as it's done respectfully.\n"
