I have agreed to pay them $700 for rent and money I owe each month. They have offered the entire upstairs apartment to me but I'd rather the room I have on our lower floor. \n\nMy parents are great, honest people but I have this gut feeling that I should be recording my payments to them for some reason. I would like to whip up a little log that has the date, the amount paid, and both of our signatures. \n\nI feel like it is a responsible thing to do but things like this  could seriously offend them (especially my mother). In a way I feel as if it chips at the trust and honesty that we are trying to maintain. How should I go about this without being an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is 21 and paying their parents $700 monthly for rent and other debts. They want to create a log with signatures to track payments. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to do this.\n\nFirst, the parents are described as honest, but the author feels the need to document payments. The concern is that this might offend the parents, especially the mother, and could undermine trust. The author is trying to balance responsibility with maintaining family trust.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, wanting to keep a record isn't inherently wrong. It's a way to manage finances responsibly. However, the approach matters. If they present it as a mutual agreement and not an accusation, it might be okay. But if it comes off as distrustful, that's where the problem lies. The parents might feel their integrity is being questioned. So, the author's intention is responsible, but the execution could be problematic if not handled sensitively. The key is how the author communicates this. If they frame it as a way to prevent misunderstandings and offer to sign as well, it's more respectful. But if they push for signatures without explanation, it might be seen as distrust. So, maybe the author isn't entirely wrong, but the way they approach it is crucial. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the intent is responsible, but they need to handle it carefully to avoid offending.\n"
