I have agreed to pay them $700 for rent and money I owe each month. They have offered the entire upstairs apartment to me but I'd rather the room I have on our lower floor. \n\nMy parents are great, honest people but I have this gut feeling that I should be recording my payments to them for some reason. I would like to whip up a little log that has the date, the amount paid, and both of our signatures. \n\nI feel like it is a responsible thing to do but things like this  could seriously offend them (especially my mother). In a way I feel as if it chips at the trust and honesty that we are trying to maintain. How should I go about this without being an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The user is 21, paying their parents $700 a month for rent and money they owe. They want to keep a log with dates, amounts, and signatures. The parents offered the upstairs apartment but the author prefers the lower floor. The author is worried about offending the parents, especially the mother, and feels it might chip away at trust.\n\nFirst, the author is trying to be responsible by tracking payments. It's not uncommon for people to have written agreements or logs to avoid misunderstandings, especially when money is involved. Even within families, having some form of record can prevent disputes. The author isn't doing anything illegal or unethical by wanting this log. They are also concerned about maintaining trust, which suggests they're considering the parents' feelings.\n\nBut is it wrong to want a log? The parents are described as honest, so maybe the author feels a need for the log not because of distrust but to have a clear record. The key here is the approach. If the author presents it as a way to ensure everyone is on the same page and to avoid any confusion, it might not be seen as offensive. However, if the parents perceive it as an accusation of dishonesty, that could be an issue. The author is aware of this potential problem, so they need to communicate the intent clearly and respectfully.\n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They're taking a responsible step. The problem might be in how they present it. The answer would be B (not in the wrong), but it's more about how they handle the situation rather than the act of keeping a log itself.\n"
