I have agreed to pay them $700 for rent and money I owe each month. They have offered the entire upstairs apartment to me but I'd rather the room I have on our lower floor. \n\nMy parents are great, honest people but I have this gut feeling that I should be recording my payments to them for some reason. I would like to whip up a little log that has the date, the amount paid, and both of our signatures. \n\nI feel like it is a responsible thing to do but things like this  could seriously offend them (especially my mother). In a way I feel as if it chips at the trust and honesty that we are trying to maintain.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the original post is in the wrong for wanting to keep a log of payments to their parents and asking them to sign it. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is 21, paying their parents $700 each month for rent and other debts. They want to create a log with dates, amounts, and signatures. The parents offered the upstairs apartment, but the author prefers the lower floor room. The author is worried that this might offend their parents, especially the mother, and possibly damage trust.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. So, I need to evaluate if the author's actions are justified or if they're overstepping.\n\nOn one hand, the author is trying to be responsible by documenting payments. This could be a way to ensure clarity and avoid misunderstandings, especially if there are financial difficulties. It's about protecting both sides in case of disputes. The author acknowledges their parents' honesty but still feels the need for a written record. That might be prudent, especially given the financial situation mentioned.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is concerned about offending their parents and affecting trust. Family dynamics can be sensitive, and introducing formal documentation might feel transactional in a family setting. However, the author is approaching it respectfully by asking for signatures and being upfront about their intentions. They're not hiding anything but trying to maintain accountability.\n\nThe key points here are the intent and the method. The author's intent is to be responsible and avoid future conflicts. The method involves a simple log with signatures, which is a common practice in financial agreements, even among family members. The fact that they're considering the parents' feelings and trying to approach it without being an \"asshole\" suggests they're aware of the sensitivity.\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong. They're taking a proactive step to protect themselves and their parents financially. The log serves as a mutual agreement and a record, which can prevent misunderstandings. While it might feel formal, it's reasonable given the circumstances. The parents might initially feel it's unnecessary, but respecting the author's need for documentation is a mature approach. So, the answer should be B (No).\n"
