I have agreed to pay them $700 for rent and money I owe each month. They have offered the entire upstairs apartment to me but I'd rather the room I have on our lower floor. \n\nMy parents are great, honest people but I have this gut feeling that I should be recording my payments to them for some reason. I would like to whip up a little log that has the date, the amount paid, and both of our signatures. \n\nI feel like it is a responsible thing to do but things like this  could seriously offend them (especially my mother). In a way I feel as if it chips at the trust and honesty that we are trying to maintain. How should I go about this without being an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about keeping a log of rent payments to parents and asking them to sign. The author is 21, and there's financial strain in the family. They're paying $700 a month, and want a record to track payments.\n\nThe options are A (in the wrong) or B (not in the wrong). The user initially thought the author is in the wrong but is curious about others' opinions.\n\nHmm. So, the author wants to document payments. Why? They mention trust and honesty, maybe feeling that their parents might not keep track properly. But the parents offered the apartment, and the author chose a different room. The author is concerned about offending, particularly the mom, by requiring a signature.\n\nFrom a legal/financial standpoint, documenting transactions is a responsible action. It's a way to avoid misunderstandings. However, culturally or emotionally, it might feel like a lack of trust. So, is it right or wrong? \n\nIn some cultures or families, such documentation is normal, especially for financial dealings. It's about protecting both parties. If the parents are honest and trustworthy, the author might be overstepping by making it a formal contract. But if there's a financial issue in the family, maybe the author is just being cautious.\n\nThe author is trying to be responsible but concerned about offending. So, maybe the issue is the method. How they approach it matters. If they explain it as a way to ensure everyone's on the same page and avoid future conflicts, it could be seen as reasonable. If they present it as distrust, then yes, it could be offensive.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If they are doing it to protect themselves and not out of suspicion, maybe not. But if they go about it the wrong way, maybe they could cause hurt feelings. The key is the approach. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the action itself is reasonable, then B (not in the wrong). If it's unnecessary and causes distrust, then A. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because it's about record-keeping, which is a common practice. The problem might be how they communicate it. But the question is about being in the wrong, not about the method. So, B.\n"
