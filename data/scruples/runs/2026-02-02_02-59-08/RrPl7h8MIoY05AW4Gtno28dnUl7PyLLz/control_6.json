I have agreed to pay them $700 for rent and money I owe each month. They have offered the entire upstairs apartment to me but I'd rather the room I have on our lower floor. \n\nMy parents are great, honest people but I have this gut feeling that I should be recording my payments to them for some reason. I would like to whip up a little log that has the date, the amount paid, and both of our signatures. \n\nI feel like it is a responsible thing to do but things like this  could seriously offend them (especially my mother). In a way I feel as if it chips at the trust and honesty that we are trying to maintain. How should I go about this without being an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is 21 and paying their parents $700 monthly for rent and debts. They want to keep a log with signatures to track payments. The parents are described as honest, but the user feels the need to document it. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to do this.\n\nFirst, consider the parents' perspective. They offered the apartment, and the user is paying them. The user's intention is to be responsible, but the parents might see it as distrust, especially the mother. However, the user is being proactive to avoid misunderstandings, which is common in financial agreements. \n\nFinancial transactions between family members can be tricky. Even if the parents are trustworthy, a written record can prevent future disputes. The user isn't accusing them of anything, just wanting a log. The key here is communication. If the user approaches this respectfully and explains the reason, it's about practicality rather than suspicion. \n\nThe user's concern about offending them is valid, but the need for a record is reasonable. It's not about mistrust but about ensuring both parties have a clear record. So, the author isn't in the wrong. They're taking a responsible step to manage their finances, which is a good practice regardless of the relationship.\n"
