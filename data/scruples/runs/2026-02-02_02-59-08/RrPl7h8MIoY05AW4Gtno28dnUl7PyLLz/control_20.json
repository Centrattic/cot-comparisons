I have agreed to pay them $700 for rent and money I owe each month. They have offered the entire upstairs apartment to me but I'd rather the room I have on our lower floor. \n\nMy parents are great, honest people but I have this gut feeling that I should be recording my payments to them for some reason. I would like to whip up a little log that has the date, the amount paid, and both of our signatures. \n\nI feel like it is a responsible thing to do but things like this  could seriously offend them (especially my mother). In a way I feel as if it chips at the trust and honesty that we are trying to maintain. How should I go about this without being an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the original question is in the wrong for wanting to keep a log and get signatures for their payments to their parents. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The person is 21, paying $700 a month to their parents for rent and owed money. They want to create a log with dates, amounts, and signatures. They're worried about offending their parents, especially their mom, and feel it might hurt trust. The question is if they're in the wrong.\n\nHmm. The main points here are about trust, boundaries, and financial responsibility. The parents are described as honest, but the person feels the need to document the payments. Why? Maybe they want a record for their own peace of mind, or there's a history of financial issues? The user is concerned about being seen as a jerk for asking for signatures.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, if the parents are honest and there's no prior issues, maybe the author is overstepping by formalizing a family matter. But if the author feels uneasy, maybe they have a reason. However, the key is the intent. The author wants to be responsible, not to doubt the parents. But the parents might see it as distrust.\n\nI think it's about how it's approached. If the author explains it's for their own records, not to suspect dishonesty, then it's reasonable. But if presented as a demand for proof, it could be seen as a lack of trust. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong, but they need to communicate their intentions clearly. So answer B (No) because the author isn't wrong, but they should handle it sensitively.\n"
