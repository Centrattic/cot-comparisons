I have agreed to pay them $700 for rent and money I owe each month. They have offered the entire upstairs apartment to me but I'd rather the room I have on our lower floor. \n\nMy parents are great, honest people but I have this gut feeling that I should be recording my payments to them for some reason. I would like to whip up a little log that has the date, the amount paid, and both of our signatures. \n\nI feel like it is a responsible thing to do but things like this  could seriously offend them (especially my mother). In a way I feel as if it chips at the trust and honesty that we are trying to maintain. How should I go about this without being an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to keep a log of payments to their parents. The author is 21, paying $700 a month to their parents for rent and money owed. They want to create a log with dates, amounts, and signatures to document these payments. They're worried it might offend their parents, especially the mother, and affect the trust between them.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about financial responsibility versus family dynamics. The author wants to be responsible, which is understandable. Financial transactions, even within families, can lead to misunderstandings if not documented. By creating a log, they're trying to prevent confusion or disputes later. But there's a cultural aspect here too; in many families, there's an unspoken trust that such matters don't need formal records. The author is concerned about offending their parents, which is valid because family relationships are delicate.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they have a legitimate reason to document the payments. However, the way they approach it could matter. If they present it as a way to protect everyone's interests and maintain transparency, that might help. But if they come off as distrustful, that could cause issues. The question is whether the act of documenting itself is wrong. I don't think so. It's a responsible action. The potential problem is how it's communicated. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong for wanting to document; they're being proactive. The real issue is how to do it without hurting family feelings. So the answer would be B (not in the wrong), but with the caveat that communication is key.\n"
