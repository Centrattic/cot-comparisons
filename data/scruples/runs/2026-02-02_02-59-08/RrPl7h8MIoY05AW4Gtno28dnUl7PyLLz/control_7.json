I have agreed to pay them $700 for rent and money I owe each month. They have offered the entire upstairs apartment to me but I'd rather the room I have on our lower floor. \n\nMy parents are great, honest people but I have this gut feeling that I should be recording my payments to them for some reason. I would like to whip up a little log that has the date, the amount paid, and both of our signatures. \n\nI feel like it is a responsible thing to do but things like this  could seriously offend them (especially my mother). In a way I feel as if it chips at the trust and honesty that we are trying to maintain. How should I go about this without being an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is 21 and has agreed to pay their parents $700 each month for rent and other debts. They want to keep a log with signatures to ensure accountability. The parents are described as honest, but there's a concern about offending them, especially the mother.\n\nFirst, is the author in the wrong? Well, they're trying to document payments, which is a common practice in many financial transactions to avoid misunderstandings. The fact that they're considering this because of a \"gut feeling\" suggests they might be worried about potential issues. The parents offered their space, but the user chose a different room, which might affect the dynamics. \n\nThe key points here are trust and communication. The author wants to maintain trust but also ensure clarity. By creating a log, they're being proactive, which isn't inherently wrong. However, the method of implementation is crucial. If they approach it as a way to verify payments rather than suspecting dishonesty, it's more about mutual accountability. \n\nThe parents might feel offended if it's perceived as distrust, but if the author explains it as a responsible step for everyone's peace of mind, it could be seen as a mature approach. The author's intention matters here. They mentioned wanting to avoid being an asshole, which shows they care about their parents' feelings. \n\nIn many cases, documenting financial agreements between family members is advisable to prevent future conflicts. So, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to do this. They just need to communicate it properly. The answer would be B, No, they're not in the wrong.\n"
