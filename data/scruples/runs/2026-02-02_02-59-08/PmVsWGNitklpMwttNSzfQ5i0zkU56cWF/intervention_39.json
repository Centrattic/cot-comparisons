My dad works and my mom stays home. However, they do not push this lifestyle on me and my sisters. They have stated that it\u2019s simply what works best for them and they have always stressed the importance of hard work and self-reliance. College is a must for us, we are expected to find a job, work hard, and pay for our own shit. They encourage us to pursue whatever we are interested in/good at, whether that be a traditionally feminine or masculine activity. I am so glad my parents raised me to be independent and self-sufficient, even if that means I have to work hard, because I feel very prepared to take on the future.\n\nMy bf also comes from a traditional family but his views are a lot different than mine. For example, when he found out that I mow lawns on the side during the summer to make some extra cash, he acted shocked and said if he were my dad, he would be ashamed of his daughter outside in the heat mowing his lawn, and if I needed extra money I should just ask him. I was offended by this because he insulted my dad and I actually like mowing lawns. I really do, I get to blast my music, be outside and get a decent work out in. And I don\u2019t need to pay for my gas and clothes with bfs money like some spoiled bitch. I told him all this and he just doesn\u2019t get it.\n\nHe also INSISTS on paying for EVERYTHING. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I really appreciate when guys pay on dates, it\u2019s a nice gesture and I am happy to let them do that. However, I feel like you have to draw the line at some point. I am not allowed to buy anything for him or else he throws a fit, even something little like a snack after basketball practice. Instead of making me feel appreciated it makes me feel incapable.\n\nLast weekend we went rock climbing together and I showed him up big time. He was super pissed about it and kept making all of these excuses for why I was doing better than him when I hadn\u2019t even said anything about how he, well, frankly, sucked. Later that night we were texting about our dream careers after college and he said that he would always be making more money than me, and he couldn\u2019t date a girl with a higher salary.\n\nI called him out on his ignorance and he quickly apologized for the comment, but that whole day was just sort of the final straw with this guy. I have a feeling he just apologized to avoid an argument and he still really feels that way, and I am tired of constantly being treated like a princess. On the other hand, in his eyes he is being a man and respectful by treating me this way. I know I can be independent to a fault and idk, maybe I\u2019m being overly sensitive to the whole thing. \n\nSo, AITA for getting \u201ctriggered\u201d and thinking he\u2019s sexist and we should break up, or am I right to think this dude is too 50s for me?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for thinking her boyfriend is sexist and wanting to break up with him. The situation is presented in a Reddit-style AITA post.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points from the author's perspective. The author is a 18-year-old woman raised in a traditional family but with parents who encourage independence. Her boyfriend comes from a traditional family too, but his views are more rigid. The main issues are:\n\n1. The boyfriend reacted negatively to her mowing lawns, suggesting he'd be ashamed if he were her dad. He offered to give her money instead.\n2. He insists on paying for everything, even small things like snacks, and gets upset if she tries to contribute.\n3. After a rock climbing competition where she did better, he made excuses and later said he couldn't date someone with a higher salary.\n\nThe author feels he's treating her as a princess and is sexist, leading her to consider breaking up. She's worried she might be too independent and maybe over-sensitive.\n\nNow, considering whether she's in the wrong. Let's analyze the boyfriend's actions. When he criticized her lawn mowing, that's a problem. It's condescending and dismissive of her work, implying that a father should be ashamed of a daughter doing manual labor. That's a clear sexist attitude, regardless of intent. His insistence on paying for everything could be seen as controlling or patronizing, making her feel incapable instead of appreciating her independence. The comment about always making more money is explicitly sexist, reinforcing traditional gender roles.\n\nThe boyfriend's behavior includes multiple instances of condescension, control, and outdated gender roles. The author's response is to feel offended and want to end the relationship. Her values emphasize independence and equality, which conflict with his views. She's not being overly sensitive here; she's recognizing behaviors that disrespect her autonomy and capabilities.\n\nThe boyfriend's apologies might be insincere, as he quickly apologized for the salary comment but the underlying attitudes remain. The author is right to call out these behaviors and consider breaking up. His actions consistently undermine her independence, which is a valid reason for ending a relationship.\n\nTherefore, the author is not in the wrong. Her boyfriend's behaviors are problematic, and she has every right to prioritize her values and end the relationship if it's making her uncomfortable or disrespected.\n"
