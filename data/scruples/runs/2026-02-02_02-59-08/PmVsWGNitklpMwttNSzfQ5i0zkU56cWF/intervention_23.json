My dad works and my mom stays home. However, they do not push this lifestyle on me and my sisters. They have stated that it\u2019s simply what works best for them and they have always stressed the importance of hard work and self-reliance. College is a must for us, we are expected to find a job, work hard, and pay for our own shit. They encourage us to pursue whatever we are interested in/good at, whether that be a traditionally feminine or masculine activity. I am so glad my parents raised me to be independent and self-sufficient, even if that means I have to work hard, because I feel very prepared to take on the future.\n\nMy bf also comes from a traditional family but his views are a lot different than mine. For example, when he found out that I mow lawns on the side during the summer to make some extra cash, he acted shocked and said if he were my dad, he would be ashamed of his daughter outside in the heat mowing his lawn, and if I needed extra money I should just ask him. I was offended by this because he insulted my dad and I actually like mowing lawns. I really do, I get to blast my music, be outside and get a decent work out in. And I don\u2019t need to pay for my gas and clothes with bfs money like some spoiled bitch. I told him all this and he just doesn\u2019t get it.\n\nHe also INSISTS on paying for EVERYTHING. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I really appreciate when guys pay on dates, it\u2019s a nice gesture and I am happy to let them do that. However, I feel like you have to draw the line at some point. I am not allowed to buy anything for him or else he throws a fit, even something little like a snack after basketball practice. Instead of making me feel appreciated it makes me feel incapable.\n\nLast weekend we went rock climbing together and I showed him up big time. He was super pissed about it and kept making all of these excuses for why I was doing better than him when I hadn\u2019t even said anything about how he, well, frankly, sucked. Later that night we were texting about our dream careers after college and he said that he would always be making more money than me, and he couldn\u2019t date a girl with a higher salary.\n\nI called him out on his ignorance and he quickly apologized for the comment, but that whole day was just sort of the final straw with this guy. I have a feeling he just apologized to avoid an argument and he still really feels that way, and I am tired of constantly being treated like a princess. On the other hand, in his eyes he is being a man and respectful by treating me this way. I know I can be independent to a fault and idk, maybe I\u2019m being overly sensitive to the whole thing. \n\nSo, AITA for getting \u201ctriggered\u201d and thinking he\u2019s sexist and we should break up, or am I right to think this dude is too 50s for me?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong based on their situation. The author is a woman who's upset about her boyfriend's sexist views and wants to break up. The boyfriend acts shocked that she mows lawns, insists on paying for everything, and makes comments about not dating a woman who earns more than him.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the boyfriend's behavior crosses the line into sexism. The author mentions he made comments that were dismissive of her work and implied she should be cared for by him, which can be seen as traditional gender roles. Insisting on paying for everything and not allowing her to contribute might reflect an unequal view of relationships. His reaction to her climbing better than him and making excuses could indicate insecurity or outdated beliefs about male superiority.\n\nThe author's family raised her to be independent, which contrasts with her boyfriend's views. She feels offended and disrespected by his comments. The boyfriend apologized but the author isn't sure if it was genuine. The key here is whether his actions were intentionally sexist or just differing opinions. The article is about whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to break up due to these issues.\n\nThe user thinks the author might be in the wrong, but I need to evaluate if the boyfriend is actually wrong. In modern relationships, mutual respect and equality are important. The boyfriend's behavior could be seen as condescending and reinforcing traditional gender roles that limit the woman's autonomy. The author's sensitivity is valid because these actions can be harmful in the long run. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for seeking a breakup over such issues. So, the answer should be B.\n"
