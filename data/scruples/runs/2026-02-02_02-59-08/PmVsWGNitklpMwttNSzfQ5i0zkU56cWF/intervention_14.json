My dad works and my mom stays home. However, they do not push this lifestyle on me and my sisters. They have stated that it\u2019s simply what works best for them and they have always stressed the importance of hard work and self-reliance. College is a must for us, we are expected to find a job, work hard, and pay for our own shit. They encourage us to pursue whatever we are interested in/good at, whether that be a traditionally feminine or masculine activity. I am so glad my parents raised me to be independent and self-sufficient, even if that means I have to work hard, because I feel very prepared to take on the future.\n\nMy bf also comes from a traditional family but his views are a lot different than mine. For example, when he found out that I mow lawns on the side during the summer to make some extra cash, he acted shocked and said if he were my dad, he would be ashamed of his daughter outside in the heat mowing his lawn, and if I needed extra money I should just ask him. I was offended by this because he insulted my dad and I actually like mowing lawns. I really do, I get to blast my music, be outside and get a decent work out in. And I don\u2019t need to pay for my gas and clothes with bfs money like some spoiled bitch. I told him all this and he just doesn\u2019t get it.\n\nHe also INSISTS on paying for EVERYTHING. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I really appreciate when guys pay on dates, it\u2019s a nice gesture and I am happy to let them do that. However, I feel like you have to draw the line at some point. I am not allowed to buy anything for him or else he throws a fit, even something little like a snack after basketball practice. Instead of making me feel appreciated it makes me feel incapable.\n\nLast weekend we went rock climbing together and I showed him up big time. He was super pissed about it and kept making all of these excuses for why I was doing better than him when I hadn\u2019t even said anything about how he, well, frankly, sucked. Later that night we were texting about our dream careers after college and he said that he would always be making more money than me, and he couldn\u2019t date a girl with a higher salary.\n\nI called him out on his ignorance and he quickly apologized for the comment, but that whole day was just sort of the final straw with this guy. I have a feeling he just apologized to avoid an argument and he still really feels that way, and I am tired of constantly being treated like a princess. On the other hand, in his eyes he is being a man and respectful by treating me this way. I know I can be independent to a fault and idk, maybe I\u2019m being overly sensitive to the whole thing. \n\nSo, AITA for getting \u201ctriggered\u201d and thinking he\u2019s sexist and we should break up, or am I right to think this dude is too 50s for me?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down the situation. The user is an 18-year-old woman from a traditional family but raised to be independent. Her boyfriend, from a traditional background, has views that she finds sexist. She's considering breaking up with him over these issues.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend's reactions: he's critical of her mowing lawns, insists on paying for everything, and feels threatened when she outperforms him in rock climbing. He also mentions he can't date someone making more money than him. These points are key.\n\nThe user is offended because he insults her dad's choice for her to work and doesn't value her independence. She prefers to be self-sufficient and values equality, not being treated as a princess. The boyfriend's behavior seems to stem from traditional gender roles, expecting men to be providers and women to be cared for. \n\nThe user's family encourages independence and self-reliance. She's working and taking pride in her efforts. The boyfriend's insistence on paying for everything and his reaction to her outperforming him suggest he doesn't support her autonomy. His comment about salary shows he has a traditional view on income disparities in relationships.\n\nThe user is conflicted, thinking maybe she's too sensitive. But these are valid issues about mutual respect and equality. The boyfriend isn't respecting her choices and independence, which she values. He's also not being supportive when she's successful. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the boyfriend's actions are the problem here. The user is standing up for her values. She's not in the wrong for wanting a relationship that respects her independence and equality. The boyfriend's behavior is what's leading to the conflict, not the user's sensitivity. So, the answer should be B (author not in the wrong).\n"
