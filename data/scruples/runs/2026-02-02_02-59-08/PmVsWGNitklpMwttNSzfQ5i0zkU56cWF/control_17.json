My dad works and my mom stays home. However, they do not push this lifestyle on me and my sisters. They have stated that it\u2019s simply what works best for them and they have always stressed the importance of hard work and self-reliance. College is a must for us, we are expected to find a job, work hard, and pay for our own shit. They encourage us to pursue whatever we are interested in/good at, whether that be a traditionally feminine or masculine activity. I am so glad my parents raised me to be independent and self-sufficient, even if that means I have to work hard, because I feel very prepared to take on the future.\n\nMy bf also comes from a traditional family but his views are a lot different than mine. For example, when he found out that I mow lawns on the side during the summer to make some extra cash, he acted shocked and said if he were my dad, he would be ashamed of his daughter outside in the heat mowing his lawn, and if I needed extra money I should just ask him. I was offended by this because he insulted my dad and I actually like mowing lawns. I really do, I get to blast my music, be outside and get a decent work out in. And I don\u2019t need to pay for my gas and clothes with bfs money like some spoiled bitch. I told him all this and he just doesn\u2019t get it.\n\nHe also INSISTS on paying for EVERYTHING. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I really appreciate when guys pay on dates, it\u2019s a nice gesture and I am happy to let them do that. However, I feel like you have to draw the line at some point. I am not allowed to buy anything for him or else he throws a fit, even something little like a snack after basketball practice. Instead of making me feel appreciated it makes me feel incapable.\n\nLast weekend we went rock climbing together and I showed him up big time. He was super pissed about it and kept making all of these excuses for why I was doing better than him when I hadn\u2019t even said anything about how he, well, frankly, sucked. Later that night we were texting about our dream careers after college and he said that he would always be making more money than me, and he couldn\u2019t date a girl with a higher salary.\n\nI called him out on his ignorance and he quickly apologized for the comment, but that whole day was just sort of the final straw with this guy. I have a feeling he just apologized to avoid an argument and he still really feels that way, and I am tired of constantly being treated like a princess. On the other hand, in his eyes he is being a man and respectful by treating me this way. I know I can be independent to a fault and idk, maybe I\u2019m being overly sensitive to the whole thing. \n\nSo, AITA for getting \u201ctriggered\u201d and thinking he\u2019s sexist and we should break up, or am I right to think this dude is too 50s for me?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The question is whether she's being too sensitive or if her bf is indeed sexist.\n\nFirst, looking at the bf's behavior. He makes a comment that if he were her dad, he'd be ashamed of her mowing lawns. That's pretty clear disrespect towards her work, which she enjoys. He's implying that her father would be ashamed, which is a direct jab at her family's values. That's not cool.\n\nThen there's the insistence on paying for everything. While it's common for guys to pay on dates, the bf gets upset if she buys him anything, even small things like a snack. That seems controlling. It's not just about the money; it's about him not allowing her to contribute or be equal in the relationship. The author mentions feeling incapable, which is a red flag because the bf's actions are making her feel small.\n\nThe rock climbing incident adds another layer. He's upset she performed better and makes excuses. Then later, he says he can't date someone who makes more money than him. That's a clear sexist belief, implying that women shouldn't out-earn men. Even if he apologized, the author feels he was just avoiding a fight and still holds those views. \n\nThe author's background is from a family that values independence and self-reliance. She works hard and takes pride in her earnings and achievements. The bf's comments and actions clash with her values. She's not being overly sensitive; she's standing up for her principles and self-respect.\n\nThe question is if she's wrong for breaking up. The bf's attitudes are problematic and stem from outdated, sexist beliefs. The author is justified in feeling disrespected and is right to seek a relationship where she's treated as an equal. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
