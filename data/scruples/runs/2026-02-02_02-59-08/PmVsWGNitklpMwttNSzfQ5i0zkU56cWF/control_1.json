My dad works and my mom stays home. However, they do not push this lifestyle on me and my sisters. They have stated that it\u2019s simply what works best for them and they have always stressed the importance of hard work and self-reliance. College is a must for us, we are expected to find a job, work hard, and pay for our own shit. They encourage us to pursue whatever we are interested in/good at, whether that be a traditionally feminine or masculine activity. I am so glad my parents raised me to be independent and self-sufficient, even if that means I have to work hard, because I feel very prepared to take on the future.\n\nMy bf also comes from a traditional family but his views are a lot different than mine. For example, when he found out that I mow lawns on the side during the summer to make some extra cash, he acted shocked and said if he were my dad, he would be ashamed of his daughter outside in the heat mowing his lawn, and if I needed extra money I should just ask him. I was offended by this because he insulted my dad and I actually like mowing lawns. I really do, I get to blast my music, be outside and get a decent work out in. And I don\u2019t need to pay for my gas and clothes with bfs money like some spoiled bitch. I told him all this and he just doesn\u2019t get it.\n\nHe also INSISTS on paying for EVERYTHING. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I really appreciate when guys pay on dates, it\u2019s a nice gesture and I am happy to let them do that. However, I feel like you have to draw the line at some point. I am not allowed to buy anything for him or else he throws a fit, even something little like a snack after basketball practice. Instead of making me feel appreciated it makes me feel incapable.\n\nLast weekend we went rock climbing together and I showed him up big time. He was super pissed about it and kept making all of these excuses for why I was doing better than him when I hadn\u2019t even said anything about how he, well, frankly, sucked. Later that night we were texting about our dream careers after college and he said that he would always be making more money than me, and he couldn\u2019t date a girl with a higher salary.\n\nI called him out on his ignorance and he quickly apologized for the comment, but that whole day was just sort of the final straw with this guy. I have a feeling he just apologized to avoid an argument and he still really feels that way, and I am tired of constantly being treated like a princess. On the other hand, in his eyes he is being a man and respectful by treating me this way. I know I can be independent to a fault and idk, maybe I\u2019m being overly sensitive to the whole thing. \n\nSo, AITA for getting \u201ctriggered\u201d and thinking he\u2019s sexist and we should break up, or am I right to think this dude is too 50s for me?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves her boyfriend having what she perceives as sexist views. Let's break down the key points.\n\nFirst, the girl is 18, from a traditional family but her parents are supportive of her independence. She works, like mowing lawns, and her boyfriend reacts negatively to that. He says he'd be ashamed if he were her dad. That's a problem because she values her independence and the way her dad supports her choices. His reaction might be reinforcing traditional gender roles, which she finds sexist.\n\nThen there's the insistence on paying for everything. She's okay with him paying on dates, but he gets upset if she tries to buy him anything, even small things. That could be seen as controlling or not respecting her autonomy. She feels it makes her feel incapable, which is a valid emotional response.\n\nThe rock climbing incident: she outperformed him and he got upset, making excuses. Later, he said he couldn't date someone who earns more than him. Even though he apologized, she feels he still holds that belief. This is a clear example of sexist attitudes regarding women's earnings and success relative to men.\n\nHer parents have taught her to be independent and self-sufficient, so she's used to working and not relying on others. The boyfriend's comments and actions seem to clash with her values. She's not being overly sensitive; she's standing up for her beliefs.\n\nFrom the boyfriend's perspective, he might think he's being respectful by treating her a certain way, but his actions and comments cross into disrespecting her independence. The key issue is whether his behavior is sexist, which she rightly identifies. She's not wrong for feeling triggered by views that devalue her capabilities and independence.\n\nSo, considering all this, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). She has valid reasons to feel that her boyfriend's views are sexist, and it's reasonable for her to want to break up over this.\n"
