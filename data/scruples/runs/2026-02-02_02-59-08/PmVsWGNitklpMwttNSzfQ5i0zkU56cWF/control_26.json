My dad works and my mom stays home. However, they do not push this lifestyle on me and my sisters. They have stated that it\u2019s simply what works best for them and they have always stressed the importance of hard work and self-reliance. College is a must for us, we are expected to find a job, work hard, and pay for our own shit. They encourage us to pursue whatever we are interested in/good at, whether that be a traditionally feminine or masculine activity. I am so glad my parents raised me to be independent and self-sufficient, even if that means I have to work hard, because I feel very prepared to take on the future.\n\nMy bf also comes from a traditional family but his views are a lot different than mine. For example, when he found out that I mow lawns on the side during the summer to make some extra cash, he acted shocked and said if he were my dad, he would be ashamed of his daughter outside in the heat mowing his lawn, and if I needed extra money I should just ask him. I was offended by this because he insulted my dad and I actually like mowing lawns. I really do, I get to blast my music, be outside and get a decent work out in. And I don\u2019t need to pay for my gas and clothes with bfs money like some spoiled bitch. I told him all this and he just doesn\u2019t get it.\n\nHe also INSISTS on paying for EVERYTHING. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I really appreciate when guys pay on dates, it\u2019s a nice gesture and I am happy to let them do that. However, I feel like you have to draw the line at some point. I am not allowed to buy anything for him or else he throws a fit, even something little like a snack after basketball practice. Instead of making me feel appreciated it makes me feel incapable.\n\nLast weekend we went rock climbing together and I showed him up big time. He was super pissed about it and kept making all of these excuses for why I was doing better than him when I hadn\u2019t even said anything about how he, well, frankly, sucked. Later that night we were texting about our dream careers after college and he said that he would always be making more money than me, and he couldn\u2019t date a girl with a higher salary.\n\nI called him out on his ignorance and he quickly apologized for the comment, but that whole day was just sort of the final straw with this guy. I have a feeling he just apologized to avoid an argument and he still really feels that way, and I am tired of constantly being treated like a princess. On the other hand, in his eyes he is being a man and respectful by treating me this way. I know I can be independent to a fault and idk, maybe I\u2019m being overly sensitive to the whole thing. \n\nSo, AITA for getting \u201ctriggered\u201d and thinking he\u2019s sexist and we should break up, or am I right to think this dude is too 50s for me?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for thinking her boyfriend is sexist and wanting to break up. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author (18F) comes from a family that values independence and self-reliance, even though they have a traditional setup. She's mowing lawns to earn money, which she enjoys. Her boyfriend reacts negatively to this, saying he'd be ashamed if she were his daughter and suggests she should just ask him for money. That seems pretty sexist. He also insists on paying for everything, even small things, which makes her feel incapable. Then there's the rock climbing incident where he got upset she did better than him and made excuses, plus his comment about him always making more money and not dating someone who earns more.\n\nThe key points here are the boyfriend's attitudes towards her work, his insistence on financial control, and his reactions to her outperforming him. The author feels these are signs of sexism and wants to break up. The user is asking if she's in the wrong.\n\nFrom a modern perspective, respecting someone's autonomy and not being controlling in a relationship is important. The boyfriend's comments about her work being beneath her and his financial control are problematic. Wanting to break up over these issues isn't being overly sensitive if the relationship isn't aligned with her values. The boyfriend's behavior suggests he has outdated views on gender roles and respect in a partnership. The author is standing up for her independence, which her family encouraged. There's no indication she's being unreasonable here. So, the answer is B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
