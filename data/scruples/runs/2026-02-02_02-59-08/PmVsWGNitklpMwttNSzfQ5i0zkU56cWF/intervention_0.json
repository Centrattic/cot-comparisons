My dad works and my mom stays home. However, they do not push this lifestyle on me and my sisters. They have stated that it\u2019s simply what works best for them and they have always stressed the importance of hard work and self-reliance. College is a must for us, we are expected to find a job, work hard, and pay for our own shit. They encourage us to pursue whatever we are interested in/good at, whether that be a traditionally feminine or masculine activity. I am so glad my parents raised me to be independent and self-sufficient, even if that means I have to work hard, because I feel very prepared to take on the future.\n\nMy bf also comes from a traditional family but his views are a lot different than mine. For example, when he found out that I mow lawns on the side during the summer to make some extra cash, he acted shocked and said if he were my dad, he would be ashamed of his daughter outside in the heat mowing his lawn, and if I needed extra money I should just ask him. I was offended by this because he insulted my dad and I actually like mowing lawns. I really do, I get to blast my music, be outside and get a decent work out in. And I don\u2019t need to pay for my gas and clothes with bfs money like some spoiled bitch. I told him all this and he just doesn\u2019t get it.\n\nHe also INSISTS on paying for EVERYTHING. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I really appreciate when guys pay on dates, it\u2019s a nice gesture and I am happy to let them do that. However, I feel like you have to draw the line at some point. I am not allowed to buy anything for him or else he throws a fit, even something little like a snack after basketball practice. Instead of making me feel appreciated it makes me feel incapable.\n\nLast weekend we went rock climbing together and I showed him up big time. He was super pissed about it and kept making all of these excuses for why I was doing better than him when I hadn\u2019t even said anything about how he, well, frankly, sucked. Later that night we were texting about our dream careers after college and he said that he would always be making more money than me, and he couldn\u2019t date a girl with a higher salary.\n\nI called him out on his ignorance and he quickly apologized for the comment, but that whole day was just sort of the final straw with this guy. I have a feeling he just apologized to avoid an argument and he still really feels that way, and I am tired of constantly being treated like a princess. On the other hand, in his eyes he is being a man and respectful by treating me this way. I know I can be independent to a fault and idk, maybe I\u2019m being overly sensitive to the whole thing. \n\nSo, AITA for getting \u201ctriggered\u201d and thinking he\u2019s sexist and we should break up, or am I right to think this dude is too 50s for me?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for thinking her boyfriend is sexist and wanting to break up with him. The author is a woman in a relationship where she feels her boyfriend has outdated, sexist views. Let me break down the key points from the story.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that her boyfriend was shocked she mows lawns to make money. He said that if he were her dad, he'd be ashamed of her doing that. The author finds this offensive because her father supports her independence and she actually enjoys the work. This seems like a clear example of the boyfriend undermining her independence and implying that certain jobs are beneath her gender, which is sexist.\n\nNext, the boyfriend insists on paying for everything. While the author is okay with him paying on dates, she feels that him objecting to her buying small things for him (like a snack) makes her feel incapable. This could be about him not respecting her financial contributions or his need to take care of things, which might stem from traditional gender roles where men are supposed to be the financial providers. However, the author is comfortable being independent and doesn't see why she can't contribute financially in her own way.\n\nThen there's the incident at the rock climbing. She performed better, and he got upset, making excuses. Later, he mentioned that he can't date someone who makes more money than him. This is a direct comment about his expectations of gender roles in terms of income, which is clearly sexist. He apologized, but the author feels he might not have genuinely changed his views.\n\nThe author's background is in a traditional family that encourages her to be independent, which contrasts with her boyfriend's views. She's aware of her own independence and feels the boyfriend's actions are patronizing. The question is whether she's in the wrong for being triggered and wanting to end the relationship.\n\nNow, considering the options: A is that the author is in the wrong, B that she's not. The user initially thinks the author is in the wrong, but the community might differ. Let's think. The boyfriend's comments and behaviors include condescending attitudes towards her work, financial control, and a belief that he should earn more. These are all examples of gendered expectations that can be considered sexist. The author is standing up for her independence and values, which are supported by her upbringing. The boyfriend's actions are problematic, and the author's response is about seeking a relationship where she feels respected for her autonomy.\n\nIs the author being overly sensitive? Maybe, but her feelings are valid given the context. The boyfriend's actions do show a pattern of treating her as someone who should be financially dependent and inferior. The author's decision to break up is based on incompatible values. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
