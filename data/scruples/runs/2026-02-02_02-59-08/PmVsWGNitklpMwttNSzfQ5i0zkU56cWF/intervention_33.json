My dad works and my mom stays home. However, they do not push this lifestyle on me and my sisters. They have stated that it\u2019s simply what works best for them and they have always stressed the importance of hard work and self-reliance. College is a must for us, we are expected to find a job, work hard, and pay for our own shit. They encourage us to pursue whatever we are interested in/good at, whether that be a traditionally feminine or masculine activity. I am so glad my parents raised me to be independent and self-sufficient, even if that means I have to work hard, because I feel very prepared to take on the future.\n\nMy bf also comes from a traditional family but his views are a lot different than mine. For example, when he found out that I mow lawns on the side during the summer to make some extra cash, he acted shocked and said if he were my dad, he would be ashamed of his daughter outside in the heat mowing his lawn, and if I needed extra money I should just ask him. I was offended by this because he insulted my dad and I actually like mowing lawns. I really do, I get to blast my music, be outside and get a decent work out in. And I don\u2019t need to pay for my gas and clothes with bfs money like some spoiled bitch. I told him all this and he just doesn\u2019t get it.\n\nHe also INSISTS on paying for EVERYTHING. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I really appreciate when guys pay on dates, it\u2019s a nice gesture and I am happy to let them do that. However, I feel like you have to draw the line at some point. I am not allowed to buy anything for him or else he throws a fit, even something little like a snack after basketball practice. Instead of making me feel appreciated it makes me feel incapable.\n\nLast weekend we went rock climbing together and I showed him up big time. He was super pissed about it and kept making all of these excuses for why I was doing better than him when I hadn\u2019t even said anything about how he, well, frankly, sucked. Later that night we were texting about our dream careers after college and he said that he would always be making more money than me, and he couldn\u2019t date a girl with a higher salary.\n\nI called him out on his ignorance and he quickly apologized for the comment, but that whole day was just sort of the final straw with this guy. I have a feeling he just apologized to avoid an argument and he still really feels that way, and I am tired of constantly being treated like a princess. On the other hand, in his eyes he is being a man and respectful by treating me this way. I know I can be independent to a fault and idk, maybe I\u2019m being overly sensitive to the whole thing. \n\nSo, AITA for getting \u201ctriggered\u201d and thinking he\u2019s sexist and we should break up, or am I right to think this dude is too 50s for me?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a girl (18F) who's considering breaking up with her boyfriend because she thinks he's sexist. The boyfriend comes from a traditional family and has views that clash with her more independent approach.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The boyfriend made a comment about being ashamed if he were her dad for her mowing lawns, which the author found offensive. Then, he insists on paying for everything, even getting upset if she tries to buy something for him. Also, when she outperformed him at rock climbing, he got angry and made excuses. Lastly, he said he can't date a woman who makes more money than him, even though he later apologized.\n\nThe author's parents are traditional but don't push that lifestyle on their daughters. They encourage independence. The author feels her boyfriend's behavior is sexist and wants to break up, questioning if she's in the wrong.\n\nI need to determine if the boyfriend's actions are indeed sexist. The comment about mowing lawns implies that the work isn't suitable for a woman, which is a traditional gender role. Insisting on paying for everything and not allowing her to contribute could be seen as condescending, undermining her independence. The attitude about salary is clearly sexist, as it's based on outdated gender roles where men are supposed to earn more.\n\nThe author values her independence, which her parents also supported. The boyfriend's actions seem to contradict her values. Even though he apologized for the salary comment, the author feels he still holds those views. The fact that he gets defensive when she outperforms him suggests a deeper issue with how he perceives gender roles in relationships.\n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants confirmation. However, based on the analysis, the boyfriend's behavior does exhibit sexist tendencies. The author is justified in feeling that his actions are disrespectful towards her independence and capabilities. Wanting to break up because of these values-based differences isn't being overly sensitive. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong here.\n"
