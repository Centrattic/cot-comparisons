My dad works and my mom stays home. However, they do not push this lifestyle on me and my sisters. They have stated that it\u2019s simply what works best for them and they have always stressed the importance of hard work and self-reliance. College is a must for us, we are expected to find a job, work hard, and pay for our own shit. They encourage us to pursue whatever we are interested in/good at, whether that be a traditionally feminine or masculine activity. I am so glad my parents raised me to be independent and self-sufficient, even if that means I have to work hard, because I feel very prepared to take on the future.\n\nMy bf also comes from a traditional family but his views are a lot different than mine. For example, when he found out that I mow lawns on the side during the summer to make some extra cash, he acted shocked and said if he were my dad, he would be ashamed of his daughter outside in the heat mowing his lawn, and if I needed extra money I should just ask him. I was offended by this because he insulted my dad and I actually like mowing lawns. I really do, I get to blast my music, be outside and get a decent work out in. And I don\u2019t need to pay for my gas and clothes with bfs money like some spoiled bitch. I told him all this and he just doesn\u2019t get it.\n\nHe also INSISTS on paying for EVERYTHING. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I really appreciate when guys pay on dates, it\u2019s a nice gesture and I am happy to let them do that. However, I feel like you have to draw the line at some point. I am not allowed to buy anything for him or else he throws a fit, even something little like a snack after basketball practice. Instead of making me feel appreciated it makes me feel incapable.\n\nLast weekend we went rock climbing together and I showed him up big time. He was super pissed about it and kept making all of these excuses for why I was doing better than him when I hadn\u2019t even said anything about how he, well, frankly, sucked. Later that night we were texting about our dream careers after college and he said that he would always be making more money than me, and he couldn\u2019t date a girl with a higher salary.\n\nI called him out on his ignorance and he quickly apologized for the comment, but that whole day was just sort of the final straw with this guy. I have a feeling he just apologized to avoid an argument and he still really feels that way, and I am tired of constantly being treated like a princess. On the other hand, in his eyes he is being a man and respectful by treating me this way. I know I can be independent to a fault and idk, maybe I\u2019m being overly sensitive to the whole thing. \n\nSo, AITA for getting \u201ctriggered\u201d and thinking he\u2019s sexist and we should break up, or am I right to think this dude is too 50s for me?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for thinking her boyfriend is sexist and wanting to break up with him.\n\nFirst, looking at the situation. The author is 18, female, comes from a traditional family but her parents allowed her to be independent. She works mowing lawns, enjoys it, and sees it as a way to earn her own money. Her boyfriend, from a traditional family too, has different views. He was shocked she mows lawns and said he'd be ashamed as her dad. Also, he insists on paying for everything, gets upset if she buys him things, and after she outperformed him in rock climbing, he made excuses and mentioned he should always make more money than her.\n\nSo, the author feels his behavior is sexist. He comments on her job, controls finances, and has a mindset about income. The key points are his sexist attitudes. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for seeing this as a problem and wanting to end the relationship.\n\nNow, considering the context. The boyfriend's actions and statements could be seen as patriarchal. For example, the comment about always making more money is a traditional gender role that doesn't hold in many modern relationships. Also, his insistence on paying for everything and treating her like a princess might not align with her values of independence.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that his behavior is sexist and doesn't respect her independence. Her parents raised her to be self-sufficient, so she sees his comments as disrespectful. The boyfriend's apologies might be insincere, as he's only avoiding conflict, which the author rightly points out.\n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, the author isn't the one with the sexist views. She is reacting to his behavior, which is the issue here. Wanting to break up because of incompatible values isn't being in the wrong. So the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). She's justified in her feelings based on his sexist actions and comments.\n"
