My dad works and my mom stays home. However, they do not push this lifestyle on me and my sisters. They have stated that it\u2019s simply what works best for them and they have always stressed the importance of hard work and self-reliance. College is a must for us, we are expected to find a job, work hard, and pay for our own shit. They encourage us to pursue whatever we are interested in/good at, whether that be a traditionally feminine or masculine activity. I am so glad my parents raised me to be independent and self-sufficient, even if that means I have to work hard, because I feel very prepared to take on the future.\n\nMy bf also comes from a traditional family but his views are a lot different than mine. For example, when he found out that I mow lawns on the side during the summer to make some extra cash, he acted shocked and said if he were my dad, he would be ashamed of his daughter outside in the heat mowing his lawn, and if I needed extra money I should just ask him. I was offended by this because he insulted my dad and I actually like mowing lawns. I really do, I get to blast my music, be outside and get a decent work out in. And I don\u2019t need to pay for my gas and clothes with bfs money like some spoiled bitch. I told him all this and he just doesn\u2019t get it.\n\nHe also INSISTS on paying for EVERYTHING. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I really appreciate when guys pay on dates, it\u2019s a nice gesture and I am happy to let them do that. However, I feel like you have to draw the line at some point. I am not allowed to buy anything for him or else he throws a fit, even something little like a snack after basketball practice. Instead of making me feel appreciated it makes me feel incapable.\n\nLast weekend we went rock climbing together and I showed him up big time. He was super pissed about it and kept making all of these excuses for why I was doing better than him when I hadn\u2019t even said anything about how he, well, frankly, sucked. Later that night we were texting about our dream careers after college and he said that he would always be making more money than me, and he couldn\u2019t date a girl with a higher salary.\n\nI called him out on his ignorance and he quickly apologized for the comment, but that whole day was just sort of the final straw with this guy. I have a feeling he just apologized to avoid an argument and he still really feels that way, and I am tired of constantly being treated like a princess. On the other hand, in his eyes he is being a man and respectful by treating me this way. I know I can be independent to a fault and idk, maybe I\u2019m being overly sensitive to the whole thing. \n\nSo, AITA for getting \u201ctriggered\u201d and thinking he\u2019s sexist and we should break up, or am I right to think this dude is too 50s for me?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a 18-year-old female who's dating a boy and has issues with what she perceives as his sexist behavior. The key points are the boyfriend's comments about her mowing lawns, insisting on paying for everything, and his reaction to her outperforming him in rock climbing, plus his comment about making more money.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the boyfriend's actions and comments. The boyfriend says he'd be ashamed if he were her dad about her mowing lawns. That's a bit of a backhanded compliment, implying that she shouldn't be doing such work. Then, he insists on paying for everything, which she finds infantilizing. The rock climbing incident shows his jealousy and making excuses, and the comment about always making more money is a clear gender stereotype.\n\nThe author's perspective is that these behaviors are sexist and outdated, leading her to want to break up. She values independence and equality in the relationship. The boyfriend, on the other hand, seems to believe he's being respectful and chivalrous by his actions, but his views are based on traditional gender roles that the author rejects.\n\nFrom a modern standpoint, expecting a partner to be financially dependent or to hold rigid gender roles can be seen as sexist. The boyfriend's comments about her job and his salary expectations reflect a belief in male superiority in certain roles. The author's reaction is about standing up for her values of independence and equality, which are valid. \n\nThe user initially thought the author might be in the wrong but is unsure. I need to consider if there's any nuance. The author isn't rejecting all gestures of chivalry, like paying on dates, but she draws the line at controlling her autonomy. The boyfriend's apology after the salary comment might be a point, but if he still holds the same beliefs, the author has reason to be concerned.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. She's addressing issues that genuinely affect her self-respect and the relationship's equality. The boyfriend's behavior is problematic, and her decision to end the relationship is justified. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
