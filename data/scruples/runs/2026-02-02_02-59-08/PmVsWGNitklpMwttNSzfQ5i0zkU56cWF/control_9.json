My dad works and my mom stays home. However, they do not push this lifestyle on me and my sisters. They have stated that it\u2019s simply what works best for them and they have always stressed the importance of hard work and self-reliance. College is a must for us, we are expected to find a job, work hard, and pay for our own shit. They encourage us to pursue whatever we are interested in/good at, whether that be a traditionally feminine or masculine activity. I am so glad my parents raised me to be independent and self-sufficient, even if that means I have to work hard, because I feel very prepared to take on the future.\n\nMy bf also comes from a traditional family but his views are a lot different than mine. For example, when he found out that I mow lawns on the side during the summer to make some extra cash, he acted shocked and said if he were my dad, he would be ashamed of his daughter outside in the heat mowing his lawn, and if I needed extra money I should just ask him. I was offended by this because he insulted my dad and I actually like mowing lawns. I really do, I get to blast my music, be outside and get a decent work out in. And I don\u2019t need to pay for my gas and clothes with bfs money like some spoiled bitch. I told him all this and he just doesn\u2019t get it.\n\nHe also INSISTS on paying for EVERYTHING. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I really appreciate when guys pay on dates, it\u2019s a nice gesture and I am happy to let them do that. However, I feel like you have to draw the line at some point. I am not allowed to buy anything for him or else he throws a fit, even something little like a snack after basketball practice. Instead of making me feel appreciated it makes me feel incapable.\n\nLast weekend we went rock climbing together and I showed him up big time. He was super pissed about it and kept making all of these excuses for why I was doing better than him when I hadn\u2019t even said anything about how he, well, frankly, sucked. Later that night we were texting about our dream careers after college and he said that he would always be making more money than me, and he couldn\u2019t date a girl with a higher salary.\n\nI called him out on his ignorance and he quickly apologized for the comment, but that whole day was just sort of the final straw with this guy. I have a feeling he just apologized to avoid an argument and he still really feels that way, and I am tired of constantly being treated like a princess. On the other hand, in his eyes he is being a man and respectful by treating me this way. I know I can be independent to a fault and idk, maybe I\u2019m being overly sensitive to the whole thing. \n\nSo, AITA for getting \u201ctriggered\u201d and thinking he\u2019s sexist and we should break up, or am I right to think this dude is too 50s for me?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given scenario is in the wrong. The scenario is about a relationship where the author (18F) feels her boyfriend is sexist and wants to break up. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author's boyfriend has traditional views. He's shocked she mows lawns, says he'd be ashamed if he were her dad, and insists on paying for everything. He also gets upset when she outperforms him in rock climbing and makes a comment about always earning more than her. She finds his behavior sexist and wants to break up.\n\nSo, the main points are: his comments about her job, his insistence on paying for everything, his reaction to her outperforming him, and his statement about not dating a woman who earns more. The author feels these are sexist and wants to end the relationship. \n\nI need to determine if she's in the wrong. The key here is whether his actions and statements are indeed sexist. Let's look at each point. \n\n1. **Comment about mowing lawns**: He acts ashamed she would do that, implying her job is beneath her. That's a problem because it's devaluing her work and comparing her to a traditional father figure who would be ashamed. This could be seen as patriarchal and disrespectful to her autonomy.\n\n2. **Insisting on paying for everything**: While some might see it as chivalrous, the author feels it's infantilizing. Not allowing her to buy anything for him, even small things, might be controlling. It's about respect for her independence. The boyfriend's reaction to her purchasing could indicate he doesn't want her to spend her own money, which might be a power dynamic issue.\n\n3. **Reaction to rock climbing**: Getting upset and making excuses when she outperforms him suggests insecurity or a belief in traditional gender roles where men should be superior. This could be a form of sexism, expecting men to always be better.\n\n4. **Comment about salary**: His statement that he should always earn more and not date someone with a higher salary is explicitly sexist. It's a clear example of traditional gender roles where men are expected to be the higher earners, which is discriminatory.\n\nThe author's family raised her to be independent, which she appreciates. Her boyfriend's views clash with her values. She's not being overly sensitive if his actions and words are based on outdated gender norms. The boyfriend's apologies might be insincere if he doesn't truly change his behavior. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to break up because of these issues. In modern relationships, mutual respect and equality are key. His behavior shows a lack of respect for her independence and capabilities, which are valid reasons for her to consider leaving. Therefore, the answer would be that she's not in the wrong.\n"
