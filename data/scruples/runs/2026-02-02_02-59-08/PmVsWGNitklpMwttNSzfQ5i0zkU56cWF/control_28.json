My dad works and my mom stays home. However, they do not push this lifestyle on me and my sisters. They have stated that it\u2019s simply what works best for them and they have always stressed the importance of hard work and self-reliance. College is a must for us, we are expected to find a job, work hard, and pay for our own shit. They encourage us to pursue whatever we are interested in/good at, whether that be a traditionally feminine or masculine activity. I am so glad my parents raised me to be independent and self-sufficient, even if that means I have to work hard, because I feel very prepared to take on the future.\n\nMy bf also comes from a traditional family but his views are a lot different than mine. For example, when he found out that I mow lawns on the side during the summer to make some extra cash, he acted shocked and said if he were my dad, he would be ashamed of his daughter outside in the heat mowing his lawn, and if I needed extra money I should just ask him. I was offended by this because he insulted my dad and I actually like mowing lawns. I really do, I get to blast my music, be outside and get a decent work out in. And I don\u2019t need to pay for my gas and clothes with bfs money like some spoiled bitch. I told him all this and he just doesn\u2019t get it.\n\nHe also INSISTS on paying for EVERYTHING. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I really appreciate when guys pay on dates, it\u2019s a nice gesture and I am happy to let them do that. However, I feel like you have to draw the line at some point. I am not allowed to buy anything for him or else he throws a fit, even something little like a snack after basketball practice. Instead of making me feel appreciated it makes me feel incapable.\n\nLast weekend we went rock climbing together and I showed him up big time. He was super pissed about it and kept making all of these excuses for why I was doing better than him when I hadn\u2019t even said anything about how he, well, frankly, sucked. Later that night we were texting about our dream careers after college and he said that he would always be making more money than me, and he couldn\u2019t date a girl with a higher salary.\n\nI called him out on his ignorance and he quickly apologized for the comment, but that whole day was just sort of the final straw with this guy. I have a feeling he just apologized to avoid an argument and he still really feels that way, and I am tired of constantly being treated like a princess. On the other hand, in his eyes he is being a man and respectful by treating me this way. I know I can be independent to a fault and idk, maybe I\u2019m being overly sensitive to the whole thing. \n\nSo, AITA for getting \u201ctriggered\u201d and thinking he\u2019s sexist and we should break up, or am I right to think this dude is too 50s for me?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The author is a 18-year-old woman in a relationship with her boyfriend, who she thinks is sexist. The main points she brings up are about the boyfriend's comments regarding her mowing lawns, insisting on paying for everything, and his reaction to her outperforming him in rock climbing, plus his statement that he should always make more money.\n\nFirst, I need to assess each of these points. The boyfriend said that if he were her dad, he'd be ashamed of her mowing lawns in the heat. That's a clear issue because he's belittling her work and implying that her father is wrong for allowing it. The author values her independence and the ability to earn her own money, which her parents support. The boyfriend's reaction is sexist because it's suggesting that certain jobs are beneath her gender. So that's a red flag.\n\nThen there's the insistence on paying for everything. While some people appreciate it when a partner pays on dates, the key here is that the boyfriend becomes upset when the author tries to buy something for him, like a snack. This could be controlling behavior, making her feel incapable. Healthy relationships involve mutual respect and allowing each other to contribute financially in their own way. By not letting her spend on him, it's enforcing a dynamic where he's the sole provider, which is a traditional gender role.\n\nThe rock climbing incident and the comment about his future salary. He got angry when she outperformed him and then said he couldn't date a woman who makes more money. That's a clear case of sexism. It's not about the performance itself but the idea that a woman's career or salary should be subordinate to the man's. The fact that he apologized but the author feels he didn't truly change is another issue. If someone makes a sexist comment and only apologizes to avoid conflict without changing their behavior, that's a problem.\n\nThe author feels triggered and wants to break up. She's standing up for her values of independence and equality. Her parents raised her to be self-sufficient, which aligns with her beliefs. The boyfriend's views are traditional and possibly sexist, conflicting with her values. The question is whether she's in the wrong for ending a relationship over these issues. \n\nIn most cases, when someone's values and the partner's values are incompatible, especially regarding respect and equality, it's not the person in the wrong. The boyfriend is displaying behaviors that disrespect the author's autonomy and equality in the relationship. The author is not being overly sensitive; she's holding her partner accountable. So, the answer would be B (No, she's not in the wrong). The key factors are mutual respect, equality, and shared values, which the boyfriend isn't meeting here.\n"
