My dad works and my mom stays home. However, they do not push this lifestyle on me and my sisters. They have stated that it\u2019s simply what works best for them and they have always stressed the importance of hard work and self-reliance. College is a must for us, we are expected to find a job, work hard, and pay for our own shit. They encourage us to pursue whatever we are interested in/good at, whether that be a traditionally feminine or masculine activity. I am so glad my parents raised me to be independent and self-sufficient, even if that means I have to work hard, because I feel very prepared to take on the future.\n\nMy bf also comes from a traditional family but his views are a lot different than mine. For example, when he found out that I mow lawns on the side during the summer to make some extra cash, he acted shocked and said if he were my dad, he would be ashamed of his daughter outside in the heat mowing his lawn, and if I needed extra money I should just ask him. I was offended by this because he insulted my dad and I actually like mowing lawns. I really do, I get to blast my music, be outside and get a decent work out in. And I don\u2019t need to pay for my gas and clothes with bfs money like some spoiled bitch. I told him all this and he just doesn\u2019t get it.\n\nHe also INSISTS on paying for EVERYTHING. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I really appreciate when guys pay on dates, it\u2019s a nice gesture and I am happy to let them do that. However, I feel like you have to draw the line at some point. I am not allowed to buy anything for him or else he throws a fit, even something little like a snack after basketball practice. Instead of making me feel appreciated it makes me feel incapable.\n\nLast weekend we went rock climbing together and I showed him up big time. He was super pissed about it and kept making all of these excuses for why I was doing better than him when I hadn\u2019t even said anything about how he, well, frankly, sucked. Later that night we were texting about our dream careers after college and he said that he would always be making more money than me, and he couldn\u2019t date a girl with a higher salary.\n\nI called him out on his ignorance and he quickly apologized for the comment, but that whole day was just sort of the final straw with this guy. I have a feeling he just apologized to avoid an argument and he still really feels that way, and I am tired of constantly being treated like a princess. On the other hand, in his eyes he is being a man and respectful by treating me this way. I know I can be independent to a fault and idk, maybe I\u2019m being overly sensitive to the whole thing. \n\nSo, AITA for getting \u201ctriggered\u201d and thinking he\u2019s sexist and we should break up, or am I right to think this dude is too 50s for me?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a relationship where the boyfriend has views that the author finds sexist.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend reacts negatively to her mowing lawns, suggesting she should just ask him for money instead. That seems problematic because it implies that her working is shameful and that he should support her financially, which is not healthy in a relationship. The author values her independence and working, so this comment would be offensive.\n\nThen, the boyfriend insists on paying for everything, even small things like a snack. The author feels this makes her feel incapable. While it's common for some to have the guy pay on dates, expecting her to never spend anything on him could be controlling. It might stem from traditional gender roles where the man is the sole provider, which can be a form of sexism.\n\nThe rock climbing incident where he gets upset and makes excuses, followed by his comment about always making more money than her. Even though he apologized, the author feels he still holds that belief. This shows a lack of respect for her abilities and aspirations, which is definitely a red flag for sexism.\n\nThe author's background is from a traditional family but they encourage independence. So she's not against traditional roles per se, but she's against being treated as less capable. The boyfriend's actions and comments seem to undermine her independence and reinforce outdated gender norms.\n\nThe author is considering breaking up because of these issues. The question is if she's in the wrong. The boyfriend's behavior crosses into disrespecting her autonomy and capabilities. The author is justified in feeling that her partner's views are incompatible with her values. Therefore, the answer should be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
