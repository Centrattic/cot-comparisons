My dad works and my mom stays home. However, they do not push this lifestyle on me and my sisters. They have stated that it\u2019s simply what works best for them and they have always stressed the importance of hard work and self-reliance. College is a must for us, we are expected to find a job, work hard, and pay for our own shit. They encourage us to pursue whatever we are interested in/good at, whether that be a traditionally feminine or masculine activity. I am so glad my parents raised me to be independent and self-sufficient, even if that means I have to work hard, because I feel very prepared to take on the future.\n\nMy bf also comes from a traditional family but his views are a lot different than mine. For example, when he found out that I mow lawns on the side during the summer to make some extra cash, he acted shocked and said if he were my dad, he would be ashamed of his daughter outside in the heat mowing his lawn, and if I needed extra money I should just ask him. I was offended by this because he insulted my dad and I actually like mowing lawns. I really do, I get to blast my music, be outside and get a decent work out in. And I don\u2019t need to pay for my gas and clothes with bfs money like some spoiled bitch. I told him all this and he just doesn\u2019t get it.\n\nHe also INSISTS on paying for EVERYTHING. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I really appreciate when guys pay on dates, it\u2019s a nice gesture and I am happy to let them do that. However, I feel like you have to draw the line at some point. I am not allowed to buy anything for him or else he throws a fit, even something little like a snack after basketball practice. Instead of making me feel appreciated it makes me feel incapable.\n\nLast weekend we went rock climbing together and I showed him up big time. He was super pissed about it and kept making all of these excuses for why I was doing better than him when I hadn\u2019t even said anything about how he, well, frankly, sucked. Later that night we were texting about our dream careers after college and he said that he would always be making more money than me, and he couldn\u2019t date a girl with a higher salary.\n\nI called him out on his ignorance and he quickly apologized for the comment, but that whole day was just sort of the final straw with this guy. I have a feeling he just apologized to avoid an argument and he still really feels that way, and I am tired of constantly being treated like a princess. On the other hand, in his eyes he is being a man and respectful by treating me this way. I know I can be independent to a fault and idk, maybe I\u2019m being overly sensitive to the whole thing. \n\nSo, AITA for getting \u201ctriggered\u201d and thinking he\u2019s sexist and we should break up, or am I right to think this dude is too 50s for me?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The author, a girl, is in a relationship with a boyfriend who she thinks is sexist. She's considering breaking up with him because of his attitudes.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend's comments about her mowing lawns. He says that if he were her dad, he'd be ashamed. That's pretty condescending. He's implying that her work is beneath her and that he should support her instead. The author likes her job and values her independence, which is understandable. His reaction seems to dismiss her choices and her capabilities.\n\nThen there's the issue of him insisting on paying for everything. While some people appreciate traditional dating gestures like a guy paying for a date, the problem here is that he doesn't allow her to contribute even in small ways, like buying him a snack. That could make her feel undervalued or infantilized. It's about mutual respect in a relationship. If he's making her feel incapable by not letting her contribute, that's a red flag.\n\nThe rock climbing incident and his subsequent comments about salary are also key points. He was upset about being outperformed and made excuses. Then he mentions that he can't date a woman who earns more. That's a clear sexist attitude. Even if he apologized, the author feels that he might not genuinely believe it, just apologized to avoid conflict. That can erode trust in a relationship.\n\nThe author's background is important. Her parents raised her to be independent, and she's proud of that. She's used to working hard and being self-sufficient. The boyfriend's views clash with her values. She's not being overly sensitive; she's standing up for her beliefs and her right to be treated as an equal partner.\n\nThe boyfriend's family is traditional, but he's not just following his family's views; he's enforcing them in a way that dismisses her autonomy. The author feels that he's trying to play a traditional male role, which conflicts with her modern, independent perspective. Relationships require compatibility in values, and if one partner's actions consistently undermine the other's independence, that's a serious issue.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the author isn't in the wrong for feeling that her boyfriend's attitudes are sexist. She has valid reasons to feel uncomfortable and to consider ending the relationship. It's about mutual respect and shared values. Answering B (she's not in the wrong) makes sense here.\n"
