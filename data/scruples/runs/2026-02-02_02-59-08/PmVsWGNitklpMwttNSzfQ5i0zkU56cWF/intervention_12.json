My dad works and my mom stays home. However, they do not push this lifestyle on me and my sisters. They have stated that it\u2019s simply what works best for them and they have always stressed the importance of hard work and self-reliance. College is a must for us, we are expected to find a job, work hard, and pay for our own shit. They encourage us to pursue whatever we are interested in/good at, whether that be a traditionally feminine or masculine activity. I am so glad my parents raised me to be independent and self-sufficient, even if that means I have to work hard, because I feel very prepared to take on the future.\n\nMy bf also comes from a traditional family but his views are a lot different than mine. For example, when he found out that I mow lawns on the side during the summer to make some extra cash, he acted shocked and said if he were my dad, he would be ashamed of his daughter outside in the heat mowing his lawn, and if I needed extra money I should just ask him. I was offended by this because he insulted my dad and I actually like mowing lawns. I really do, I get to blast my music, be outside and get a decent work out in. And I don\u2019t need to pay for my gas and clothes with bfs money like some spoiled bitch. I told him all this and he just doesn\u2019t get it.\n\nHe also INSISTS on paying for EVERYTHING. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I really appreciate when guys pay on dates, it\u2019s a nice gesture and I am happy to let them do that. However, I feel like you have to draw the line at some point. I am not allowed to buy anything for him or else he throws a fit, even something little like a snack after basketball practice. Instead of making me feel appreciated it makes me feel incapable.\n\nLast weekend we went rock climbing together and I showed him up big time. He was super pissed about it and kept making all of these excuses for why I was doing better than him when I hadn\u2019t even said anything about how he, well, frankly, sucked. Later that night we were texting about our dream careers after college and he said that he would always be making more money than me, and he couldn\u2019t date a girl with a higher salary.\n\nI called him out on his ignorance and he quickly apologized for the comment, but that whole day was just sort of the final straw with this guy. I have a feeling he just apologized to avoid an argument and he still really feels that way, and I am tired of constantly being treated like a princess. On the other hand, in his eyes he is being a man and respectful by treating me this way. I know I can be independent to a fault and idk, maybe I\u2019m being overly sensitive to the whole thing. \n\nSo, AITA for getting \u201ctriggered\u201d and thinking he\u2019s sexist and we should break up, or am I right to think this dude is too 50s for me?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author, an 18-year-old woman, who is in a relationship with her boyfriend. She's concerned that he's sexist and wants to break up because of it.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points of the story. The author comes from a traditional family but her parents are supportive of their daughters' independence. She works part-time mowing lawns and values being self-sufficient. Her boyfriend, from a traditional family too, has different views. He expressed disapproval of her mowing lawns, saying he would be ashamed as her dad. He also insists on paying for everything, which makes her feel incapable. After she outperformed him in rock climbing, he got upset and made a comment about always earning more than her. He later apologized, but she feels he was just avoiding an argument.\n\nNow, the author is questioning if she's in the wrong for wanting to break up, thinking he's sexist and too traditional (50s-style). She mentions she might be overly sensitive. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nTo determine if the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B), I need to assess the boyfriend's behavior and the author's response. The boyfriend's actions and comments do seem problematic. Disparaging the author's work, controlling her spending, and making a statement about earning more than her are all signs of sexism and a lack of respect for her independence. The author's desire to break up is based on his behavior, which conflicts with her values of independence and equality.\n\nThe boyfriend's apologies might not be genuine if he still holds those views, which the author rightly questions. The author isn't being overly sensitive; she's standing up for her values. Therefore, the boyfriend's actions are problematic, and the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to end the relationship because of his sexist attitudes.\n"
