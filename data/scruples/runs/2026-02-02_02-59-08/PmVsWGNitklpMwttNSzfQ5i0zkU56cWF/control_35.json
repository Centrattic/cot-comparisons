My dad works and my mom stays home. However, they do not push this lifestyle on me and my sisters. They have stated that it\u2019s simply what works best for them and they have always stressed the importance of hard work and self-reliance. College is a must for us, we are expected to find a job, work hard, and pay for our own shit. They encourage us to pursue whatever we are interested in/good at, whether that be a traditionally feminine or masculine activity. I am so glad my parents raised me to be independent and self-sufficient, even if that means I have to work hard, because I feel very prepared to take on the future.\n\nMy bf also comes from a traditional family but his views are a lot different than mine. For example, when he found out that I mow lawns on the side during the summer to make some extra cash, he acted shocked and said if he were my dad, he would be ashamed of his daughter outside in the heat mowing his lawn, and if I needed extra money I should just ask him. I was offended by this because he insulted my dad and I actually like mowing lawns. I really do, I get to blast my music, be outside and get a decent work out in. And I don\u2019t need to pay for my gas and clothes with bfs money like some spoiled bitch. I told him all this and he just doesn\u2019t get it.\n\nHe also INSISTS on paying for EVERYTHING. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I really appreciate when guys pay on dates, it\u2019s a nice gesture and I am happy to let them do that. However, I feel like you have to draw the line at some point. I am not allowed to buy anything for him or else he throws a fit, even something little like a snack after basketball practice. Instead of making me feel appreciated it makes me feel incapable.\n\nLast weekend we went rock climbing together and I showed him up big time. He was super pissed about it and kept making all of these excuses for why I was doing better than him when I hadn\u2019t even said anything about how he, well, frankly, sucked. Later that night we were texting about our dream careers after college and he said that he would always be making more money than me, and he couldn\u2019t date a girl with a higher salary.\n\nI called him out on his ignorance and he quickly apologized for the comment, but that whole day was just sort of the final straw with this guy. I have a feeling he just apologized to avoid an argument and he still really feels that way, and I am tired of constantly being treated like a princess. On the other hand, in his eyes he is being a man and respectful by treating me this way. I know I can be independent to a fault and idk, maybe I\u2019m being overly sensitive to the whole thing. \n\nSo, AITA for getting \u201ctriggered\u201d and thinking he\u2019s sexist and we should break up, or am I right to think this dude is too 50s for me?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the author (18F) is in the wrong for thinking her boyfriend is sexist and wanting to break up. Let me read through the scenario again.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend's comments about her mowing lawns. He says he'd be ashamed if he were her dad, implying that it's beneath her. That's a problem because it's condescending and disrespectful. He's judging her work, which she enjoys and is using to make her own money. The fact that he doesn't support her independence is a red flag.\n\nThen there's the insistence on paying for everything. While some people appreciate the gesture, the key issue here is that the boyfriend gets upset if she tries to contribute. The author feels it makes her feel incapable. It's about mutual respect and equality in the relationship. The boyfriend's reaction seems controlling rather than generous.\n\nThe rock climbing incident and his subsequent comment about always making more money. Even though he apologized, the author feels it's just to avoid conflict. That suggests he might not truly believe he's wrong, which is a bigger issue. The comment about never dating a woman who earns more is clearly sexist. It reflects a belief in traditional gender roles where men should be the higher earners, which is outdated and unfair.\n\nThe author's family encourages independence and self-reliance, so her values clash with her boyfriend's. She's not being overly sensitive here; she's standing up for her principles. Wanting to end the relationship because of these fundamental disagreements isn't wrong. The boyfriend's behavior is sexist in multiple ways, and the author has the right to leave a relationship that makes her feel disrespected.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is justified in her feelings. The answer should be B (not in the wrong).\n"
