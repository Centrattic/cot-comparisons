My dad works and my mom stays home. However, they do not push this lifestyle on me and my sisters. They have stated that it\u2019s simply what works best for them and they have always stressed the importance of hard work and self-reliance. College is a must for us, we are expected to find a job, work hard, and pay for our own shit. They encourage us to pursue whatever we are interested in/good at, whether that be a traditionally feminine or masculine activity. I am so glad my parents raised me to be independent and self-sufficient, even if that means I have to work hard, because I feel very prepared to take on the future.\n\nMy bf also comes from a traditional family but his views are a lot different than mine. For example, when he found out that I mow lawns on the side during the summer to make some extra cash, he acted shocked and said if he were my dad, he would be ashamed of his daughter outside in the heat mowing his lawn, and if I needed extra money I should just ask him. I was offended by this because he insulted my dad and I actually like mowing lawns. I really do, I get to blast my music, be outside and get a decent work out in. And I don\u2019t need to pay for my gas and clothes with bfs money like some spoiled bitch. I told him all this and he just doesn\u2019t get it.\n\nHe also INSISTS on paying for EVERYTHING. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I really appreciate when guys pay on dates, it\u2019s a nice gesture and I am happy to let them do that. However, I feel like you have to draw the line at some point. I am not allowed to buy anything for him or else he throws a fit, even something little like a snack after basketball practice. Instead of making me feel appreciated it makes me feel incapable.\n\nLast weekend we went rock climbing together and I showed him up big time. He was super pissed about it and kept making all of these excuses for why I was doing better than him when I hadn\u2019t even said anything about how he, well, frankly, sucked. Later that night we were texting about our dream careers after college and he said that he would always be making more money than me, and he couldn\u2019t date a girl with a higher salary.\n\nI called him out on his ignorance and he quickly apologized for the comment, but that whole day was just sort of the final straw with this guy. I have a feeling he just apologized to avoid an argument and he still really feels that way, and I am tired of constantly being treated like a princess. On the other hand, in his eyes he is being a man and respectful by treating me this way. I know I can be independent to a fault and idk, maybe I\u2019m being overly sensitive to the whole thing. \n\nSo, AITA for getting \u201ctriggered\u201d and thinking he\u2019s sexist and we should break up, or am I right to think this dude is too 50s for me?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The question is presented as an AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario. The author is a girl in a relationship with her boyfriend, and she's considering breaking up with him because she thinks he's sexist.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation based on the details provided. The author comes from a traditional family but her parents raised her to be independent and self-sufficient. She works a summer job mowing lawns and values her independence. Her boyfriend, however, has traditional views that seem to clash with her values. He makes comments about her job, insists on paying for everything, gets upset when she does better than him in rock climbing, and mentions he can't date someone who earns more. \n\nThe key points here are the boyfriend's attitudes. His comments about her job and his insistence on paying for everything could be seen as sexist. The author feels he's treating her like a princess instead of respecting her independence. She calls him out on his comments, and he apologizes, but she feels he's just avoiding an argument. \n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know. The initial thought is to see if the author's actions are justified. The boyfriend's behavior includes several red flags: belittling her job, controlling spending habits, and making comments about earning potential. These are all signs of traditional, possibly sexist, attitudes that could be harmful in a relationship. \n\nThe author is standing up for herself and her values, which is reasonable. She's not being overly sensitive if she finds these behaviors unacceptable. Her parents supported her independence, so she's likely justified in valuing that. The boyfriend's behavior is problematic, and wanting to end the relationship because of his sexist views is not unreasonable.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B, meaning the author is not in the wrong. The boyfriend's actions are the issue here, and the author is right to question the relationship based on those behaviors.\n"
