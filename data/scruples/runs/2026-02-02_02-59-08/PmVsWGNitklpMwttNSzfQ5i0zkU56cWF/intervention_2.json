My dad works and my mom stays home. However, they do not push this lifestyle on me and my sisters. They have stated that it\u2019s simply what works best for them and they have always stressed the importance of hard work and self-reliance. College is a must for us, we are expected to find a job, work hard, and pay for our own shit. They encourage us to pursue whatever we are interested in/good at, whether that be a traditionally feminine or masculine activity. I am so glad my parents raised me to be independent and self-sufficient, even if that means I have to work hard, because I feel very prepared to take on the future.\n\nMy bf also comes from a traditional family but his views are a lot different than mine. For example, when he found out that I mow lawns on the side during the summer to make some extra cash, he acted shocked and said if he were my dad, he would be ashamed of his daughter outside in the heat mowing his lawn, and if I needed extra money I should just ask him. I was offended by this because he insulted my dad and I actually like mowing lawns. I really do, I get to blast my music, be outside and get a decent work out in. And I don\u2019t need to pay for my gas and clothes with bfs money like some spoiled bitch. I told him all this and he just doesn\u2019t get it.\n\nHe also INSISTS on paying for EVERYTHING. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I really appreciate when guys pay on dates, it\u2019s a nice gesture and I am happy to let them do that. However, I feel like you have to draw the line at some point. I am not allowed to buy anything for him or else he throws a fit, even something little like a snack after basketball practice. Instead of making me feel appreciated it makes me feel incapable.\n\nLast weekend we went rock climbing together and I showed him up big time. He was super pissed about it and kept making all of these excuses for why I was doing better than him when I hadn\u2019t even said anything about how he, well, frankly, sucked. Later that night we were texting about our dream careers after college and he said that he would always be making more money than me, and he couldn\u2019t date a girl with a higher salary.\n\nI called him out on his ignorance and he quickly apologized for the comment, but that whole day was just sort of the final straw with this guy. I have a feeling he just apologized to avoid an argument and he still really feels that way, and I am tired of constantly being treated like a princess. On the other hand, in his eyes he is being a man and respectful by treating me this way. I know I can be independent to a fault and idk, maybe I\u2019m being overly sensitive to the whole thing. \n\nSo, AITA for getting \u201ctriggered\u201d and thinking he\u2019s sexist and we should break up, or am I right to think this dude is too 50s for me?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for thinking her boyfriend is sexist and wanting to break up with him. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is 18, raised in a traditional family but her parents don't push that lifestyle onto her. They encourage independence and self-reliance. Her boyfriend, from a traditional background, has different views. \n\nHe makes a comment about being ashamed if he were her dad for her mowing lawns, which she finds offensive. She likes the job and doesn't want to rely on him financially. He also insists on paying for everything, even small things, and gets upset when she outperforms him in rock climbing. He mentions he couldn't date someone who earns more than him, though he apologized afterward.\n\nThe author feels he's being sexist and wants to break up. She's unsure if she's overreacting. The user thinks she's in the wrong but wants my input.\n\nI need to assess if the boyfriend's actions are sexist. The comments about being ashamed of her job could be seen as condescending, implying that her work isn't appropriate or that she should be taken care of. Insisting on paying for everything might be a form of traditional gender roles, which the author finds infantilizing. The comment about salary, even if he apologized, suggests a belief in male superiority in earnings. \n\nThe author values independence, which her parents instilled. Her boyfriend's actions contradict her values. Wanting to end the relationship because of incompatible values isn't necessarily being in the wrong. However, the boyfriend's intentions might be different\u2014maybe he's trying to be a \"gentleman\" as per his upbringing. But his behavior still crosses into disrespectful territory by undermining her autonomy and capabilities.\n\nThe key points are mutual respect in a relationship. If the boyfriend's actions make her feel incapable or disrespected, that's a valid reason to end the relationship. The author isn't wrong for prioritizing her self-respect and independence. So, the answer should be B (not in the wrong).\n"
