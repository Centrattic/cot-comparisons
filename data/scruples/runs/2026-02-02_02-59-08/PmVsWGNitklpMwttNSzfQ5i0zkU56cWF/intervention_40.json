My dad works and my mom stays home. However, they do not push this lifestyle on me and my sisters. They have stated that it\u2019s simply what works best for them and they have always stressed the importance of hard work and self-reliance. College is a must for us, we are expected to find a job, work hard, and pay for our own shit. They encourage us to pursue whatever we are interested in/good at, whether that be a traditionally feminine or masculine activity. I am so glad my parents raised me to be independent and self-sufficient, even if that means I have to work hard, because I feel very prepared to take on the future.\n\nMy bf also comes from a traditional family but his views are a lot different than mine. For example, when he found out that I mow lawns on the side during the summer to make some extra cash, he acted shocked and said if he were my dad, he would be ashamed of his daughter outside in the heat mowing his lawn, and if I needed extra money I should just ask him. I was offended by this because he insulted my dad and I actually like mowing lawns. I really do, I get to blast my music, be outside and get a decent work out in. And I don\u2019t need to pay for my gas and clothes with bfs money like some spoiled bitch. I told him all this and he just doesn\u2019t get it.\n\nHe also INSISTS on paying for EVERYTHING. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I really appreciate when guys pay on dates, it\u2019s a nice gesture and I am happy to let them do that. However, I feel like you have to draw the line at some point. I am not allowed to buy anything for him or else he throws a fit, even something little like a snack after basketball practice. Instead of making me feel appreciated it makes me feel incapable.\n\nLast weekend we went rock climbing together and I showed him up big time. He was super pissed about it and kept making all of these excuses for why I was doing better than him when I hadn\u2019t even said anything about how he, well, frankly, sucked. Later that night we were texting about our dream careers after college and he said that he would always be making more money than me, and he couldn\u2019t date a girl with a higher salary.\n\nI called him out on his ignorance and he quickly apologized for the comment, but that whole day was just sort of the final straw with this guy. I have a feeling he just apologized to avoid an argument and he still really feels that way, and I am tired of constantly being treated like a princess. On the other hand, in his eyes he is being a man and respectful by treating me this way. I know I can be independent to a fault and idk, maybe I\u2019m being overly sensitive to the whole thing. \n\nSo, AITA for getting \u201ctriggered\u201d and thinking he\u2019s sexist and we should break up, or am I right to think this dude is too 50s for me?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The author is an 18-year-old woman in a relationship with a boyfriend whose views she finds sexist. The main points are: the boyfriend is critical of her mowing lawns, insists on paying for everything, gets upset when she outperforms him in rock climbing, and previously said he can't date a woman who earns more than him. The author is considering breaking up because of these issues.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the boyfriend's behavior is indeed sexist or if the author is overreacting. The boyfriend's comments about her mowing lawns and his insistence on paying for everything suggest traditional gender roles where men are the providers and women are expected to be taken care of. The comment about not dating someone with a higher salary is clearly problematic as it implies a belief in male superiority in earnings. \n\nThe author's parents, while traditional in their own setup, support their daughters' independence, which contrasts with the boyfriend's attitudes. The boyfriend's reactions to the author's independence (like mowing lawns and rock climbing) indicate discomfort with her being self-reliant, which could be seen as sexist. \n\nThe author feels that these behaviors are disrespectful and want to end the relationship. The boyfriend claims to be respectful but his actions don't align with that. The key here is whether the boyfriend's views are objectively sexist or if the author is misinterpreting them. \n\nThe boyfriend's apology after the salary comment might be insincere, as the author suspects. If he truly believed in equality, he wouldn't have made that statement in the first place. His insistence on paying for everything and his reaction to her work and skills suggest a lack of support for her independence, which is a red flag in a healthy relationship. \n\nThe author is not being overly sensitive here. The boyfriend's behavior crosses into controlling and sexist territory by undermining her autonomy and enforcing traditional roles. The author's decision to break up is a valid response to these issues. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
