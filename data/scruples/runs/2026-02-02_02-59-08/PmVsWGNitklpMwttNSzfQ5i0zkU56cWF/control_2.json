My dad works and my mom stays home. However, they do not push this lifestyle on me and my sisters. They have stated that it\u2019s simply what works best for them and they have always stressed the importance of hard work and self-reliance. College is a must for us, we are expected to find a job, work hard, and pay for our own shit. They encourage us to pursue whatever we are interested in/good at, whether that be a traditionally feminine or masculine activity. I am so glad my parents raised me to be independent and self-sufficient, even if that means I have to work hard, because I feel very prepared to take on the future.\n\nMy bf also comes from a traditional family but his views are a lot different than mine. For example, when he found out that I mow lawns on the side during the summer to make some extra cash, he acted shocked and said if he were my dad, he would be ashamed of his daughter outside in the heat mowing his lawn, and if I needed extra money I should just ask him. I was offended by this because he insulted my dad and I actually like mowing lawns. I really do, I get to blast my music, be outside and get a decent work out in. And I don\u2019t need to pay for my gas and clothes with bfs money like some spoiled bitch. I told him all this and he just doesn\u2019t get it.\n\nHe also INSISTS on paying for EVERYTHING. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I really appreciate when guys pay on dates, it\u2019s a nice gesture and I am happy to let them do that. However, I feel like you have to draw the line at some point. I am not allowed to buy anything for him or else he throws a fit, even something little like a snack after basketball practice. Instead of making me feel appreciated it makes me feel incapable.\n\nLast weekend we went rock climbing together and I showed him up big time. He was super pissed about it and kept making all of these excuses for why I was doing better than him when I hadn\u2019t even said anything about how he, well, frankly, sucked. Later that night we were texting about our dream careers after college and he said that he would always be making more money than me, and he couldn\u2019t date a girl with a higher salary.\n\nI called him out on his ignorance and he quickly apologized for the comment, but that whole day was just sort of the final straw with this guy. I have a feeling he just apologized to avoid an argument and he still really feels that way, and I am tired of constantly being treated like a princess. On the other hand, in his eyes he is being a man and respectful by treating me this way. I know I can be independent to a fault and idk, maybe I\u2019m being overly sensitive to the whole thing. \n\nSo, AITA for getting \u201ctriggered\u201d and thinking he\u2019s sexist and we should break up, or am I right to think this dude is too 50s for me?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the question is about whether she's justified in thinking her boyfriend is sexist and wanting to break up with him. \n\nFirst, let's look at the specific examples she gives. The boyfriend acts shocked that she mows lawns, saying her dad would be ashamed. That's a bit of a put-down, implying that her work is beneath her because she's a girl. Then he insists on paying for everything, even getting upset if she buys anything for him. The author feels this makes her feel incapable, not appreciated. \n\nThen there's the rock climbing incident where he gets mad when she does better than him. He starts making excuses, and later says he can't date someone who earns more. Even though he apologized, she thinks he just did it to avoid an argument and still holds that view. \n\nThe author comes from a family that values independence, even though it's traditional. She's worked hard to be self-sufficient, and the boyfriend's comments seem to undermine her efforts and her choice to work. The boyfriend's behavior includes condescension, control over finances, and traditional gender roles that the author disagrees with. \n\nIs this sexism? The boyfriend's comments suggest he believes women should not engage in certain types of work, especially if it's manual or physically demanding. He believes he should be the sole provider and that a woman's career should not surpass his. These are classic sexist attitudes, even if he's not a malicious person. \n\nThe author is standing up for her values and independence, which are important to her. The boyfriend's actions and words are not supportive of her autonomy. The fact that he apologizes but then doesn't change his behavior (like in the rock climbing example) suggests he's not genuinely committed to changing his views. \n\nSo, the author is not in the wrong. She's recognizing that the boyfriend's behaviors are sexist and that they conflict with her values. It's reasonable to want to end a relationship where the partner doesn't respect your independence and holds outdated views on gender roles. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
