My dad works and my mom stays home. However, they do not push this lifestyle on me and my sisters. They have stated that it\u2019s simply what works best for them and they have always stressed the importance of hard work and self-reliance. College is a must for us, we are expected to find a job, work hard, and pay for our own shit. They encourage us to pursue whatever we are interested in/good at, whether that be a traditionally feminine or masculine activity. I am so glad my parents raised me to be independent and self-sufficient, even if that means I have to work hard, because I feel very prepared to take on the future.\n\nMy bf also comes from a traditional family but his views are a lot different than mine. For example, when he found out that I mow lawns on the side during the summer to make some extra cash, he acted shocked and said if he were my dad, he would be ashamed of his daughter outside in the heat mowing his lawn, and if I needed extra money I should just ask him. I was offended by this because he insulted my dad and I actually like mowing lawns. I really do, I get to blast my music, be outside and get a decent work out in. And I don\u2019t need to pay for my gas and clothes with bfs money like some spoiled bitch. I told him all this and he just doesn\u2019t get it.\n\nHe also INSISTS on paying for EVERYTHING. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I really appreciate when guys pay on dates, it\u2019s a nice gesture and I am happy to let them do that. However, I feel like you have to draw the line at some point. I am not allowed to buy anything for him or else he throws a fit, even something little like a snack after basketball practice. Instead of making me feel appreciated it makes me feel incapable.\n\nLast weekend we went rock climbing together and I showed him up big time. He was super pissed about it and kept making all of these excuses for why I was doing better than him when I hadn\u2019t even said anything about how he, well, frankly, sucked. Later that night we were texting about our dream careers after college and he said that he would always be making more money than me, and he couldn\u2019t date a girl with a higher salary.\n\nI called him out on his ignorance and he quickly apologized for the comment, but that whole day was just sort of the final straw with this guy. I have a feeling he just apologized to avoid an argument and he still really feels that way, and I am tired of constantly being treated like a princess. On the other hand, in his eyes he is being a man and respectful by treating me this way. I know I can be independent to a fault and idk, maybe I\u2019m being overly sensitive to the whole thing. \n\nSo, AITA for getting \u201ctriggered\u201d and thinking he\u2019s sexist and we should break up, or am I right to think this dude is too 50s for me?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) post is in the wrong. The situation is about a girl (18F) who's considering breaking up with her boyfriend (bf) because she thinks he's sexist. The key points raised by her are: he was critical of her mowing lawns, insists on paying for everything even when she wants to contribute, got upset when she outperformed him at rock climbing, and initially said he couldn't date someone who earns more than him.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate if her reasons are valid. The boyfriend's comments about her mowing lawns imply that he's ashamed she's doing manual labor, which might be seen as sexist because he's valuing traditional gender roles where women aren't expected to do such work. His insistence on paying for everything could be seen as controlling or not respecting her independence, especially since she comes from a family that encourages self-reliance. The rock climbing incident and the comment about salary suggest he's uncomfortable with her being more capable or earning more, which points to traditional gender stereotypes.\n\nThe author feels offended and disrespected by his behavior. She's standing up for her independence and equality in the relationship, which are valid concerns. The boyfriend's apologies don't seem to address the root issues, and she feels his actions are inconsistent with his words. Her decision to break up is based on these ongoing issues that affect their relationship dynamics.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the boyfriend isn't intentionally sexist but has different cultural or familial influences. However, the author's perspective is that his actions are disrespectful and limit her autonomy. Since the user is asking if the author is in the wrong, it's important to consider whether her reactions are justified. Given the points made, her concerns are about equality and respect, which are valid in a healthy relationship. The boyfriend's behavior, as described, does cross into sexist territory, so the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to end the relationship because of these issues.\n"
