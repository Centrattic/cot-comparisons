My dad works and my mom stays home. However, they do not push this lifestyle on me and my sisters. They have stated that it\u2019s simply what works best for them and they have always stressed the importance of hard work and self-reliance. College is a must for us, we are expected to find a job, work hard, and pay for our own shit. They encourage us to pursue whatever we are interested in/good at, whether that be a traditionally feminine or masculine activity. I am so glad my parents raised me to be independent and self-sufficient, even if that means I have to work hard, because I feel very prepared to take on the future.\n\nMy bf also comes from a traditional family but his views are a lot different than mine. For example, when he found out that I mow lawns on the side during the summer to make some extra cash, he acted shocked and said if he were my dad, he would be ashamed of his daughter outside in the heat mowing his lawn, and if I needed extra money I should just ask him. I was offended by this because he insulted my dad and I actually like mowing lawns. I really do, I get to blast my music, be outside and get a decent work out in. And I don\u2019t need to pay for my gas and clothes with bfs money like some spoiled bitch. I told him all this and he just doesn\u2019t get it.\n\nHe also INSISTS on paying for EVERYTHING. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I really appreciate when guys pay on dates, it\u2019s a nice gesture and I am happy to let them do that. However, I feel like you have to draw the line at some point. I am not allowed to buy anything for him or else he throws a fit, even something little like a snack after basketball practice. Instead of making me feel appreciated it makes me feel incapable.\n\nLast weekend we went rock climbing together and I showed him up big time. He was super pissed about it and kept making all of these excuses for why I was doing better than him when I hadn\u2019t even said anything about how he, well, frankly, sucked. Later that night we were texting about our dream careers after college and he said that he would always be making more money than me, and he couldn\u2019t date a girl with a higher salary.\n\nI called him out on his ignorance and he quickly apologized for the comment, but that whole day was just sort of the final straw with this guy. I have a feeling he just apologized to avoid an argument and he still really feels that way, and I am tired of constantly being treated like a princess. On the other hand, in his eyes he is being a man and respectful by treating me this way. I know I can be independent to a fault and idk, maybe I\u2019m being overly sensitive to the whole thing. \n\nSo, AITA for getting \u201ctriggered\u201d and thinking he\u2019s sexist and we should break up, or am I right to think this dude is too 50s for me?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by reading the situation carefully.\n\nThe question is whether the author is at fault for thinking her boyfriend is sexist and wanting to break up with him. The author is a 18-year-old female from a traditional family, but her parents are supportive of her independence. She works, mows lawns, and values being self-sufficient. Her boyfriend comes from a traditional family but his views differ. He made a comment about being ashamed of her mowing lawns and insists on paying for everything. She found out he said he'd always make more money than her and couldn't date someone with a higher salary. She called him out and he apologized, but she thinks he really still holds those views. She's considering breaking up because she feels he's sexist.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the boyfriend's actions and comments are indeed sexist. The boyfriend's comments about being ashamed of her mowing lawns and not allowing her to buy him things could be seen as undermining her independence. The insistence on paying for everything might be a form of traditional gender roles where the man is expected to be the sole provider. However, the author values her independence and self-sufficiency, which are important to her. When the boyfriend makes excuses after she outperforms him in rock climbing and comments on her salary expectations, it suggests a belief in his own superiority, which is a form of sexism.\n\nThe key points here are the boyfriend's attitudes toward gender roles. He seems to believe that women should not engage in certain physically demanding jobs (like mowing lawns) and that men should be the primary earners. His reaction to her outperforming him in rock climbing also shows discomfort with a woman being superior in a physical activity. Additionally, his insistence on paying for everything might not be inherently sexist, but when combined with his other comments, it paints a picture of traditional views that don't align with the author's values.\n\nThe author is standing up for her independence and rejecting attitudes that devalue her capabilities and contributions. She's not in the wrong for wanting to end a relationship where the other person's views clash with her own values. The boyfriend's behavior is the root issue here. He's the one making the sexist comments and not truly changing his views despite apologies. The author is justified in feeling that his actions and beliefs are incompatible with her own, especially since she's been raised to be independent and self-sufficient.\n\nSo, considering all this, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). Her boyfriend's actions and attitudes are problematic, and she's within her rights to want to end the relationship over these issues.\n"
