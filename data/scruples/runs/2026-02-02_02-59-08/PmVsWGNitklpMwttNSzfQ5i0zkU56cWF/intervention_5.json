My dad works and my mom stays home. However, they do not push this lifestyle on me and my sisters. They have stated that it\u2019s simply what works best for them and they have always stressed the importance of hard work and self-reliance. College is a must for us, we are expected to find a job, work hard, and pay for our own shit. They encourage us to pursue whatever we are interested in/good at, whether that be a traditionally feminine or masculine activity. I am so glad my parents raised me to be independent and self-sufficient, even if that means I have to work hard, because I feel very prepared to take on the future.\n\nMy bf also comes from a traditional family but his views are a lot different than mine. For example, when he found out that I mow lawns on the side during the summer to make some extra cash, he acted shocked and said if he were my dad, he would be ashamed of his daughter outside in the heat mowing his lawn, and if I needed extra money I should just ask him. I was offended by this because he insulted my dad and I actually like mowing lawns. I really do, I get to blast my music, be outside and get a decent work out in. And I don\u2019t need to pay for my gas and clothes with bfs money like some spoiled bitch. I told him all this and he just doesn\u2019t get it.\n\nHe also INSISTS on paying for EVERYTHING. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I really appreciate when guys pay on dates, it\u2019s a nice gesture and I am happy to let them do that. However, I feel like you have to draw the line at some point. I am not allowed to buy anything for him or else he throws a fit, even something little like a snack after basketball practice. Instead of making me feel appreciated it makes me feel incapable.\n\nLast weekend we went rock climbing together and I showed him up big time. He was super pissed about it and kept making all of these excuses for why I was doing better than him when I hadn\u2019t even said anything about how he, well, frankly, sucked. Later that night we were texting about our dream careers after college and he said that he would always be making more money than me, and he couldn\u2019t date a girl with a higher salary.\n\nI called him out on his ignorance and he quickly apologized for the comment, but that whole day was just sort of the final straw with this guy. I have a feeling he just apologized to avoid an argument and he still really feels that way, and I am tired of constantly being treated like a princess. On the other hand, in his eyes he is being a man and respectful by treating me this way. I know I can be independent to a fault and idk, maybe I\u2019m being overly sensitive to the whole thing. \n\nSo, AITA for getting \u201ctriggered\u201d and thinking he\u2019s sexist and we should break up, or am I right to think this dude is too 50s for me?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person in the given scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a 18-year-old girl who's considering breaking up with her boyfriend because she thinks he's sexist. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the girl comes from a traditional family but her parents don't push traditional gender roles on her. They value independence and self-reliance. She's working part-time mowing lawns, which she enjoys, and she's okay with her boyfriend paying for dates but not everything else. The boyfriend's comments include being ashamed of her mowing lawns and insisting on paying for everything, even small things. Also, after she outperformed him in rock climbing, he made excuses and said he'd always make more money than her, which led to the breakup consideration.\n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants another opinion. The key points here are the boyfriend's statements and actions. The first comment about being ashamed if he were her dad implies that he sees her job as beneath her, which is a problem. Insisting on paying for everything could be seen as dismissive of her independence. The comment about her not having a higher salary is clearly sexist. \n\nThe girl values her independence and self-sufficiency, which her parents instilled in her. She's offended by the boyfriend's attitudes that seem to undermine her capabilities and his assumptions about gender roles. His apologies after the salary comment might not be genuine if he still holds those views. \n\nThe user's question is whether she's in the wrong for ending the relationship because of these issues. From what I see, the boyfriend's behavior is problematic and sexist. The girl's reaction is justified given her values. So the answer should be B (she's not in the wrong).\n"
