My dad works and my mom stays home. However, they do not push this lifestyle on me and my sisters. They have stated that it\u2019s simply what works best for them and they have always stressed the importance of hard work and self-reliance. College is a must for us, we are expected to find a job, work hard, and pay for our own shit. They encourage us to pursue whatever we are interested in/good at, whether that be a traditionally feminine or masculine activity. I am so glad my parents raised me to be independent and self-sufficient, even if that means I have to work hard, because I feel very prepared to take on the future.\n\nMy bf also comes from a traditional family but his views are a lot different than mine. For example, when he found out that I mow lawns on the side during the summer to make some extra cash, he acted shocked and said if he were my dad, he would be ashamed of his daughter outside in the heat mowing his lawn, and if I needed extra money I should just ask him. I was offended by this because he insulted my dad and I actually like mowing lawns. I really do, I get to blast my music, be outside and get a decent work out in. And I don\u2019t need to pay for my gas and clothes with bfs money like some spoiled bitch. I told him all this and he just doesn\u2019t get it.\n\nHe also INSISTS on paying for EVERYTHING. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I really appreciate when guys pay on dates, it\u2019s a nice gesture and I am happy to let them do that. However, I feel like you have to draw the line at some point. I am not allowed to buy anything for him or else he throws a fit, even something little like a snack after basketball practice. Instead of making me feel appreciated it makes me feel incapable.\n\nLast weekend we went rock climbing together and I showed him up big time. He was super pissed about it and kept making all of these excuses for why I was doing better than him when I hadn\u2019t even said anything about how he, well, frankly, sucked. Later that night we were texting about our dream careers after college and he said that he would always be making more money than me, and he couldn\u2019t date a girl with a higher salary.\n\nI called him out on his ignorance and he quickly apologized for the comment, but that whole day was just sort of the final straw with this guy. I have a feeling he just apologized to avoid an argument and he still really feels that way, and I am tired of constantly being treated like a princess. On the other hand, in his eyes he is being a man and respectful by treating me this way. I know I can be independent to a fault and idk, maybe I\u2019m being overly sensitive to the whole thing. \n\nSo, AITA for getting \u201ctriggered\u201d and thinking he\u2019s sexist and we should break up, or am I right to think this dude is too 50s for me?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this situation. The user is asking whether the author (18F) is in the wrong for thinking her boyfriend is sexist and wanting to break up. So first, I need to analyze the key points from the scenario she described.\n\nShe comes from a traditional family but her parents support her independence. Her boyfriend, from a traditional family, has different views. He reacted negatively to her mowing lawns, insisted on paying for everything, and made a comment about not dating a woman who earns more than him. The author feels he's being sexist and wants to break up.\n\nNow, I should consider the elements of sexism here. The boyfriend's statements and actions seem to reinforce traditional gender roles that devalue women's work and economic independence. When he says he'd be ashamed if she were her dad, that's a direct slight on her work and implies that such labor is beneath her. Insisting on paying for everything could be seen as infantilizing her, treating her as someone who can't manage her own finances. The comment about not dating a woman who makes more money is a clear example of wage inequality and gender bias.\n\nThe author's reaction is based on these behaviors, which she perceives as disrespectful and sexist. She values her independence and self-sufficiency, which her parents instilled in her. Her boyfriend's actions contradict her values, leading to conflict. The key here is whether his behavior is indeed sexist, which it seems to be, and whether the author is justified in ending the relationship over it.\n\nThe boyfriend's refusal to engage with her perspective and his defensive or dismissive responses (like throwing a fit over her buying him a snack) exacerbate the issue. The author isn't being overly sensitive; she's standing by her principles of equality and mutual respect in a relationship. Wanting to end a relationship when core values are violated is a valid choice.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong). The boyfriend's actions clearly exhibit sexist attitudes, and the author has every right to prioritize her values and self-respect in the relationship.\n"
