My dad works and my mom stays home. However, they do not push this lifestyle on me and my sisters. They have stated that it\u2019s simply what works best for them and they have always stressed the importance of hard work and self-reliance. College is a must for us, we are expected to find a job, work hard, and pay for our own shit. They encourage us to pursue whatever we are interested in/good at, whether that be a traditionally feminine or masculine activity. I am so glad my parents raised me to be independent and self-sufficient, even if that means I have to work hard, because I feel very prepared to take on the future.\n\nMy bf also comes from a traditional family but his views are a lot different than mine. For example, when he found out that I mow lawns on the side during the summer to make some extra cash, he acted shocked and said if he were my dad, he would be ashamed of his daughter outside in the heat mowing his lawn, and if I needed extra money I should just ask him. I was offended by this because he insulted my dad and I actually like mowing lawns. I really do, I get to blast my music, be outside and get a decent work out in. And I don\u2019t need to pay for my gas and clothes with bfs money like some spoiled bitch. I told him all this and he just doesn\u2019t get it.\n\nHe also INSISTS on paying for EVERYTHING. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I really appreciate when guys pay on dates, it\u2019s a nice gesture and I am happy to let them do that. However, I feel like you have to draw the line at some point. I am not allowed to buy anything for him or else he throws a fit, even something little like a snack after basketball practice. Instead of making me feel appreciated it makes me feel incapable.\n\nLast weekend we went rock climbing together and I showed him up big time. He was super pissed about it and kept making all of these excuses for why I was doing better than him when I hadn\u2019t even said anything about how he, well, frankly, sucked. Later that night we were texting about our dream careers after college and he said that he would always be making more money than me, and he couldn\u2019t date a girl with a higher salary.\n\nI called him out on his ignorance and he quickly apologized for the comment, but that whole day was just sort of the final straw with this guy. I have a feeling he just apologized to avoid an argument and he still really feels that way, and I am tired of constantly being treated like a princess. On the other hand, in his eyes he is being a man and respectful by treating me this way. I know I can be independent to a fault and idk, maybe I\u2019m being overly sensitive to the whole thing. \n\nSo, AITA for getting \u201ctriggered\u201d and thinking he\u2019s sexist and we should break up, or am I right to think this dude is too 50s for me?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The question is whether she's justified in breaking up with her boyfriend over his sexist behavior. \n\nFirst, the author is 18, female, comes from a traditional family but her parents are supportive of their daughters being independent. She works, mows lawns, is self-sufficient. Her boyfriend, who also comes from a traditional family, has different views. He's dismissive of her work, says he'd be ashamed if he were her dad. She's offended. He pays for everything, even gets upset if she buys him a snack. Then, during rock climbing, he's upset she's better than him and mentions he should always make more money than her. She calls him out, he apologizes, but she feels it's the last straw.\n\nThe author is questioning if she's being too sensitive. The user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but now wants my opinion. \n\nSo, the key points are his sexist comments and behaviors. The boyfriend's actions suggest he has traditional gender roles, which the author finds problematic. He's acting like she should be treated as a princess, which she resents. She's independent and wants to be seen as equal. His comments about her working and his salary expectations are direct sexism. \n\nThe author isn't wrong for being upset. She's standing up for her values. He's not respecting her independence, which is a red flag. The fact that he apologized but might not really mean it is a problem. The author's reasons for breaking up are valid because his views conflict with her values. \n\nSo, the answer should be B (not in the wrong). She's justified in wanting to end the relationship if his behavior is sexist and disrespectful to her independence.\n"
