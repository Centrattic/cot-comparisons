My dad works and my mom stays home. However, they do not push this lifestyle on me and my sisters. They have stated that it\u2019s simply what works best for them and they have always stressed the importance of hard work and self-reliance. College is a must for us, we are expected to find a job, work hard, and pay for our own shit. They encourage us to pursue whatever we are interested in/good at, whether that be a traditionally feminine or masculine activity. I am so glad my parents raised me to be independent and self-sufficient, even if that means I have to work hard, because I feel very prepared to take on the future.\n\nMy bf also comes from a traditional family but his views are a lot different than mine. For example, when he found out that I mow lawns on the side during the summer to make some extra cash, he acted shocked and said if he were my dad, he would be ashamed of his daughter outside in the heat mowing his lawn, and if I needed extra money I should just ask him. I was offended by this because he insulted my dad and I actually like mowing lawns. I really do, I get to blast my music, be outside and get a decent work out in. And I don\u2019t need to pay for my gas and clothes with bfs money like some spoiled bitch. I told him all this and he just doesn\u2019t get it.\n\nHe also INSISTS on paying for EVERYTHING. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I really appreciate when guys pay on dates, it\u2019s a nice gesture and I am happy to let them do that. However, I feel like you have to draw the line at some point. I am not allowed to buy anything for him or else he throws a fit, even something little like a snack after basketball practice. Instead of making me feel appreciated it makes me feel incapable.\n\nLast weekend we went rock climbing together and I showed him up big time. He was super pissed about it and kept making all of these excuses for why I was doing better than him when I hadn\u2019t even said anything about how he, well, frankly, sucked. Later that night we were texting about our dream careers after college and he said that he would always be making more money than me, and he couldn\u2019t date a girl with a higher salary.\n\nI called him out on his ignorance and he quickly apologized for the comment, but that whole day was just sort of the final straw with this guy. I have a feeling he just apologized to avoid an argument and he still really feels that way, and I am tired of constantly being treated like a princess. On the other hand, in his eyes he is being a man and respectful by treating me this way. I know I can be independent to a fault and idk, maybe I\u2019m being overly sensitive to the whole thing. \n\nSo, AITA for getting \u201ctriggered\u201d and thinking he\u2019s sexist and we should break up, or am I right to think this dude is too 50s for me?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The scenario is about a girl (18F) who's upset with her boyfriend's sexist behavior and wants to break up. The boyfriend comes from a traditional family but his views are conflicting with hers.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The girl mentions her parents support her independence, and she's grateful for that. Her boyfriend, though, has traditional views: he's shocked she mows lawns, insists on paying for everything, and was upset when she outperformed him in rock climbing. He also made a comment about always making more money than her, which she found sexist.\n\nThe boyfriend's actions include belittling her work, controlling who she spends money on, and being possessive in a way that undermines her autonomy. The girl feels these are sexist and that he's treating her like a princess instead of an equal. She's considering breaking up because of this.\n\nNow, the user initially thought the author is in the wrong but wants to know what others think. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no).\n\nTo decide: The boyfriend's behavior includes making sexist remarks, controlling her financial independence, and treating her with a lack of respect for her abilities. The girl's reaction is based on these issues. Her stance is that these are valid reasons for breakup, as they stem from his sexist attitudes. \n\nIn the context of modern relationships, equality and mutual respect are important. The boyfriend's actions suggest a traditional, possibly sexist viewpoint that the girl is uncomfortable with. Her decision to end the relationship because of these values is not in the wrong. She's standing up for her beliefs and independence.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
