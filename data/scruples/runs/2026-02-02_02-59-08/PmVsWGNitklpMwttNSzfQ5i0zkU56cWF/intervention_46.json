My dad works and my mom stays home. However, they do not push this lifestyle on me and my sisters. They have stated that it\u2019s simply what works best for them and they have always stressed the importance of hard work and self-reliance. College is a must for us, we are expected to find a job, work hard, and pay for our own shit. They encourage us to pursue whatever we are interested in/good at, whether that be a traditionally feminine or masculine activity. I am so glad my parents raised me to be independent and self-sufficient, even if that means I have to work hard, because I feel very prepared to take on the future.\n\nMy bf also comes from a traditional family but his views are a lot different than mine. For example, when he found out that I mow lawns on the side during the summer to make some extra cash, he acted shocked and said if he were my dad, he would be ashamed of his daughter outside in the heat mowing his lawn, and if I needed extra money I should just ask him. I was offended by this because he insulted my dad and I actually like mowing lawns. I really do, I get to blast my music, be outside and get a decent work out in. And I don\u2019t need to pay for my gas and clothes with bfs money like some spoiled bitch. I told him all this and he just doesn\u2019t get it.\n\nHe also INSISTS on paying for EVERYTHING. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I really appreciate when guys pay on dates, it\u2019s a nice gesture and I am happy to let them do that. However, I feel like you have to draw the line at some point. I am not allowed to buy anything for him or else he throws a fit, even something little like a snack after basketball practice. Instead of making me feel appreciated it makes me feel incapable.\n\nLast weekend we went rock climbing together and I showed him up big time. He was super pissed about it and kept making all of these excuses for why I was doing better than him when I hadn\u2019t even said anything about how he, well, frankly, sucked. Later that night we were texting about our dream careers after college and he said that he would always be making more money than me, and he couldn\u2019t date a girl with a higher salary.\n\nI called him out on his ignorance and he quickly apologized for the comment, but that whole day was just sort of the final straw with this guy. I have a feeling he just apologized to avoid an argument and he still really feels that way, and I am tired of constantly being treated like a princess. On the other hand, in his eyes he is being a man and respectful by treating me this way. I know I can be independent to a fault and idk, maybe I\u2019m being overly sensitive to the whole thing. \n\nSo, AITA for getting \u201ctriggered\u201d and thinking he\u2019s sexist and we should break up, or am I right to think this dude is too 50s for me?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The scenario involves a relationship where the author (18F) is concerned about her boyfriend's sexist behavior and wants to break up. Let me go through the details again.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend reacts negatively to her mowing lawns, saying if he were her dad, he'd be ashamed. That's a clear issue. Insulting her father and implying that her job isn't appropriate for a woman is sexist. He suggests she should just ask him for money instead of working, which undermines her independence and autonomy. The author clearly values her ability to be self-sufficient, which her parents taught her, and his reaction would be offensive.\n\nNext, he insists on paying for everything. While splitting the bill can vary by culture and personal preference, the boyfriend throws a fit when she buys something small for him. This suggests he has rigid gender roles in mind, expecting her to be financially dependent. The author appreciates gestures like him paying on dates but feels it crosses into problematic territory when it becomes controlling.\n\nThen there's the rock climbing incident and his reaction to her outperforming him. He made excuses and later mentioned that he can't date someone who earns more. This shows a lack of support for her capabilities and a belief in traditional gender roles where men should earn more. The author is right to feel disrespected here. When he apologized, it seems like it was to avoid conflict rather than genuine remorse, which indicates he might not truly understand or care about her feelings.\n\nThe author's main issue is that she wants equality in the relationship and mutual respect for each other's capabilities. Her boyfriend's actions and comments suggest he doesn't support her independence and has outdated views on gender roles. The fact that he comes from a traditional family might influence his behavior, but that doesn't excuse his actions. The author is justified in feeling that his behavior is sexist and that their values are incompatible.\n\nConsidering all this, the author is not in the wrong. Her decision to break up is based on valid concerns about respect, independence, and equality in the relationship. The boyfriend's actions are problematic, and she's right to seek a relationship where both partners are treated as equals. So the answer should be B (No, author is not in the wrong).\n"
