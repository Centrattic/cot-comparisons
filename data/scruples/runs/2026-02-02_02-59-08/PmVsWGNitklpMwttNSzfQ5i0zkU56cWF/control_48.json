My dad works and my mom stays home. However, they do not push this lifestyle on me and my sisters. They have stated that it\u2019s simply what works best for them and they have always stressed the importance of hard work and self-reliance. College is a must for us, we are expected to find a job, work hard, and pay for our own shit. They encourage us to pursue whatever we are interested in/good at, whether that be a traditionally feminine or masculine activity. I am so glad my parents raised me to be independent and self-sufficient, even if that means I have to work hard, because I feel very prepared to take on the future.\n\nMy bf also comes from a traditional family but his views are a lot different than mine. For example, when he found out that I mow lawns on the side during the summer to make some extra cash, he acted shocked and said if he were my dad, he would be ashamed of his daughter outside in the heat mowing his lawn, and if I needed extra money I should just ask him. I was offended by this because he insulted my dad and I actually like mowing lawns. I really do, I get to blast my music, be outside and get a decent work out in. And I don\u2019t need to pay for my gas and clothes with bfs money like some spoiled bitch. I told him all this and he just doesn\u2019t get it.\n\nHe also INSISTS on paying for EVERYTHING. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I really appreciate when guys pay on dates, it\u2019s a nice gesture and I am happy to let them do that. However, I feel like you have to draw the line at some point. I am not allowed to buy anything for him or else he throws a fit, even something little like a snack after basketball practice. Instead of making me feel appreciated it makes me feel incapable.\n\nLast weekend we went rock climbing together and I showed him up big time. He was super pissed about it and kept making all of these excuses for why I was doing better than him when I hadn\u2019t even said anything about how he, well, frankly, sucked. Later that night we were texting about our dream careers after college and he said that he would always be making more money than me, and he couldn\u2019t date a girl with a higher salary.\n\nI called him out on his ignorance and he quickly apologized for the comment, but that whole day was just sort of the final straw with this guy. I have a feeling he just apologized to avoid an argument and he still really feels that way, and I am tired of constantly being treated like a princess. On the other hand, in his eyes he is being a man and respectful by treating me this way. I know I can be independent to a fault and idk, maybe I\u2019m being overly sensitive to the whole thing. \n\nSo, AITA for getting \u201ctriggered\u201d and thinking he\u2019s sexist and we should break up, or am I right to think this dude is too 50s for me?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is a 18-year-old woman (18F) from a traditional family where her mom stays home and dad works, but they don't push that lifestyle onto their daughters. They encourage independence and self-reliance. The author works, like mowing lawns, which she enjoys. Her boyfriend, however, comes from a traditional family but has different views. He's acted shocked that she mows lawns, saying he'd be ashamed as her dad, and suggested she just ask him for money instead. He insists on paying for everything, even getting upset when she buys something for him. Then there was an incident at rock climbing where he was upset she did better, and he mentioned he'd always make more money and couldn't date someone with a higher salary. The author feels he's sexist and wants to break up.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B). So, the key points here are about gender roles and differing values between the couple. The author values independence, equality, and mutual support, while the boyfriend seems to have traditional, possibly sexist views that the author finds offensive.\n\nFirst, I should consider the boyfriend's actions. He criticized her for working in a way her dad wouldn't. That's a direct insult to her father's values. He also doesn't support her independence by offering money instead, which undermines her efforts. Insisting on paying for everything could be controlling, making her feel incapable. The comment about his future salary being higher shows a belief in male superiority in earning, which is sexist. Even if he apologized, the underlying attitude seems problematic.\n\nThe author is reacting to these behaviors, which she correctly identifies as sexist. She's standing up for her own values of equality and independence. The fact that her parents support her independence and her boyfriend's family has traditional views might explain the contrast. The author isn't being overly sensitive; she's recognizing behavior that's disrespectful and unequal. The boyfriend's actions and comments are the main issues here.\n\nSo, the author is not in the wrong. She's justified in feeling that her boyfriend's views are sexist and incompatible with her values. The answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
