My dad works and my mom stays home. However, they do not push this lifestyle on me and my sisters. They have stated that it\u2019s simply what works best for them and they have always stressed the importance of hard work and self-reliance. College is a must for us, we are expected to find a job, work hard, and pay for our own shit. They encourage us to pursue whatever we are interested in/good at, whether that be a traditionally feminine or masculine activity. I am so glad my parents raised me to be independent and self-sufficient, even if that means I have to work hard, because I feel very prepared to take on the future.\n\nMy bf also comes from a traditional family but his views are a lot different than mine. For example, when he found out that I mow lawns on the side during the summer to make some extra cash, he acted shocked and said if he were my dad, he would be ashamed of his daughter outside in the heat mowing his lawn, and if I needed extra money I should just ask him. I was offended by this because he insulted my dad and I actually like mowing lawns. I really do, I get to blast my music, be outside and get a decent work out in. And I don\u2019t need to pay for my gas and clothes with bfs money like some spoiled bitch. I told him all this and he just doesn\u2019t get it.\n\nHe also INSISTS on paying for EVERYTHING. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I really appreciate when guys pay on dates, it\u2019s a nice gesture and I am happy to let them do that. However, I feel like you have to draw the line at some point. I am not allowed to buy anything for him or else he throws a fit, even something little like a snack after basketball practice. Instead of making me feel appreciated it makes me feel incapable.\n\nLast weekend we went rock climbing together and I showed him up big time. He was super pissed about it and kept making all of these excuses for why I was doing better than him when I hadn\u2019t even said anything about how he, well, frankly, sucked. Later that night we were texting about our dream careers after college and he said that he would always be making more money than me, and he couldn\u2019t date a girl with a higher salary.\n\nI called him out on his ignorance and he quickly apologized for the comment, but that whole day was just sort of the final straw with this guy. I have a feeling he just apologized to avoid an argument and he still really feels that way, and I am tired of constantly being treated like a princess. On the other hand, in his eyes he is being a man and respectful by treating me this way. I know I can be independent to a fault and idk, maybe I\u2019m being overly sensitive to the whole thing. \n\nSo, AITA for getting \u201ctriggered\u201d and thinking he\u2019s sexist and we should break up, or am I right to think this dude is too 50s for me?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for thinking her boyfriend is sexist and wanting to break up with him. The author is 18F, comes from a traditional family but her parents are supportive of their daughters being independent. The boyfriend comes from a traditional family too but his views are causing issues.\n\nFirst, let me break down the key points from the author's perspective. She mows lawns in the summer, and the boyfriend was shocked and said he'd be ashamed if he were her dad. That's a problem because it insults her father and she actually enjoys the work. She also feels that the boyfriend insists on paying for everything, even small things, which makes her feel incapable. Then there's the rock climbing incident where he got upset she did better than him, and he mentioned he would always make more money. She thinks he's sexist and wants to break up.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong. So I need to evaluate both sides. \n\nFrom the author's viewpoint, the boyfriend's comments about her mowing lawns are dismissive of her work and imply it's beneath her. His insistence on paying for everything could be seen as infantilizing her, not respecting her ability to contribute and make her own purchases. The comment about making more money is clearly sexist, suggesting she shouldn't earn more than him, which is problematic. These are valid concerns about sexism and lack of respect for her independence.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend might see his actions as chivalrous\u2014paying for dates as a gesture of respect. But the issue is that the author's independence is important to her, and his behavior doesn't align with her values. The fact that he apologized but might still hold the same view is a red flag for her.\n\nThe user's argument is that maybe the author is being overly sensitive. But considering her background of being raised to be independent, his actions and comments directly conflict with that. She's not being overly sensitive; she's standing up for her values and independence. The boyfriend's behavior, especially the comment about salary, is clearly problematic. The author is not in the wrong for wanting to leave a relationship where the partner's views are fundamentally incompatible with her values.\n"
