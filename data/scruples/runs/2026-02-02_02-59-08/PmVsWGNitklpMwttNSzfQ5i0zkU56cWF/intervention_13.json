My dad works and my mom stays home. However, they do not push this lifestyle on me and my sisters. They have stated that it\u2019s simply what works best for them and they have always stressed the importance of hard work and self-reliance. College is a must for us, we are expected to find a job, work hard, and pay for our own shit. They encourage us to pursue whatever we are interested in/good at, whether that be a traditionally feminine or masculine activity. I am so glad my parents raised me to be independent and self-sufficient, even if that means I have to work hard, because I feel very prepared to take on the future.\n\nMy bf also comes from a traditional family but his views are a lot different than mine. For example, when he found out that I mow lawns on the side during the summer to make some extra cash, he acted shocked and said if he were my dad, he would be ashamed of his daughter outside in the heat mowing his lawn, and if I needed extra money I should just ask him. I was offended by this because he insulted my dad and I actually like mowing lawns. I really do, I get to blast my music, be outside and get a decent work out in. And I don\u2019t need to pay for my gas and clothes with bfs money like some spoiled bitch. I told him all this and he just doesn\u2019t get it.\n\nHe also INSISTS on paying for EVERYTHING. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I really appreciate when guys pay on dates, it\u2019s a nice gesture and I am happy to let them do that. However, I feel like you have to draw the line at some point. I am not allowed to buy anything for him or else he throws a fit, even something little like a snack after basketball practice. Instead of making me feel appreciated it makes me feel incapable.\n\nLast weekend we went rock climbing together and I showed him up big time. He was super pissed about it and kept making all of these excuses for why I was doing better than him when I hadn\u2019t even said anything about how he, well, frankly, sucked. Later that night we were texting about our dream careers after college and he said that he would always be making more money than me, and he couldn\u2019t date a girl with a higher salary.\n\nI called him out on his ignorance and he quickly apologized for the comment, but that whole day was just sort of the final straw with this guy. I have a feeling he just apologized to avoid an argument and he still really feels that way, and I am tired of constantly being treated like a princess. On the other hand, in his eyes he is being a man and respectful by treating me this way. I know I can be independent to a fault and idk, maybe I\u2019m being overly sensitive to the whole thing. \n\nSo, AITA for getting \u201ctriggered\u201d and thinking he\u2019s sexist and we should break up, or am I right to think this dude is too 50s for me?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in their situation with their boyfriend. The scenario is presented as an AITA (Am I the Asshole) question, and the user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but is seeking a different perspective.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points from the author's story. The author is 18F, comes from a traditional family but one that encourages independence and self-reliance. The boyfriend, from a traditional family, has views that the author finds sexist. Specific incidents include the boyfriend's reaction to her mowing lawns, insisting on paying for everything, getting upset when she outperforms him in rock climbing, and making a comment about always earning more than her. The author feels disrespected and wants to break up, but the boyfriend apologizes and claims he's just being a man and respectful. The author is questioning if she's overreacting.\n\nNow, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). The user initially thinks A but is curious about the answer. \n\nTo determine this, I need to assess whether the boyfriend's actions are indeed problematic and whether the author's reaction is justified. The boyfriend's comments about mowing lawns and not needing to work could be seen as dismissive of her independence and implying that such work isn't suitable for her. Insisting on paying for everything, even small things, might undermine her autonomy. The comment about always making more money than her is clearly sexist and based on outdated gender roles. The fact that the boyfriend apologizes but the author feels he's just avoiding conflict might be valid concern. \n\nThe author values independence and self-reliance, which her parents taught her. The boyfriend's behavior contradicts those values. The author isn't being overly sensitive; these are legitimate issues about equality and mutual respect in a relationship. The boyfriend's insistence on traditional roles and his sexist remarks are problematic. The author has the right to be in a relationship where both partners are equals. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to break up over these issues. The correct answer would be B (No).\n"
