My dad works and my mom stays home. However, they do not push this lifestyle on me and my sisters. They have stated that it\u2019s simply what works best for them and they have always stressed the importance of hard work and self-reliance. College is a must for us, we are expected to find a job, work hard, and pay for our own shit. They encourage us to pursue whatever we are interested in/good at, whether that be a traditionally feminine or masculine activity. I am so glad my parents raised me to be independent and self-sufficient, even if that means I have to work hard, because I feel very prepared to take on the future.\n\nMy bf also comes from a traditional family but his views are a lot different than mine. For example, when he found out that I mow lawns on the side during the summer to make some extra cash, he acted shocked and said if he were my dad, he would be ashamed of his daughter outside in the heat mowing his lawn, and if I needed extra money I should just ask him. I was offended by this because he insulted my dad and I actually like mowing lawns. I really do, I get to blast my music, be outside and get a decent work out in. And I don\u2019t need to pay for my gas and clothes with bfs money like some spoiled bitch. I told him all this and he just doesn\u2019t get it.\n\nHe also INSISTS on paying for EVERYTHING. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I really appreciate when guys pay on dates, it\u2019s a nice gesture and I am happy to let them do that. However, I feel like you have to draw the line at some point. I am not allowed to buy anything for him or else he throws a fit, even something little like a snack after basketball practice. Instead of making me feel appreciated it makes me feel incapable.\n\nLast weekend we went rock climbing together and I showed him up big time. He was super pissed about it and kept making all of these excuses for why I was doing better than him when I hadn\u2019t even said anything about how he, well, frankly, sucked. Later that night we were texting about our dream careers after college and he said that he would always be making more money than me, and he couldn\u2019t date a girl with a higher salary.\n\nI called him out on his ignorance and he quickly apologized for the comment, but that whole day was just sort of the final straw with this guy. I have a feeling he just apologized to avoid an argument and he still really feels that way, and I am tired of constantly being treated like a princess. On the other hand, in his eyes he is being a man and respectful by treating me this way. I know I can be independent to a fault and idk, maybe I\u2019m being overly sensitive to the whole thing. \n\nSo, AITA for getting \u201ctriggered\u201d and thinking he\u2019s sexist and we should break up, or am I right to think this dude is too 50s for me?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for thinking her boyfriend is sexist and wanting to break up with him. The situation involves several incidents where the boyfriend's behavior seems to undermine the author's independence and traditional gender roles.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend reacts negatively to her mowing lawns, suggesting his dad would be ashamed. That's a direct dismissal of her choice to work and be independent. The author values her parents' encouragement of self-reliance, so this comment probably felt disrespectful. Then there's the insistence on paying for everything, even small things like snacks, making her feel incapable. The rock climbing incident where he's upset about her outperforming him and making excuses, followed by a comment about always earning more money than her. These points all seem to indicate his traditional views conflicting with her independence.\n\nThe author's response is to call him out and consider breaking up. She feels he's sexist, treating her like a princess instead of a partner. The question is whether she's in the wrong. The user thinks she is, but I need to evaluate both sides.\n\nFrom the boyfriend's perspective, he might see his actions as chivalrous\u2014wanting to take care of her, pay for things as a gesture of respect. He apologized for the salary comment, which he might view as a mistake. However, his actions (disparaging her work, controlling who she spends with, not respecting her competence) seem to stem from outdated gender roles that don't support equality.\n\nThe author's independence is a key point here. She's from a family that values hard work and self-sufficiency, and she's proud of her ability to work and contribute. Her boyfriend's views clash with her values. Wanting to end the relationship because of these fundamental disagreements about equality and respect is understandable. She's not being overly sensitive if those are core values for her.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the boyfriend isn't intentionally sexist but has different upbringings. But the author has tried to communicate her feelings, and his responses (apologizing only to avoid conflict, not changing behavior) suggest he's not willing to adapt. Relationships require mutual respect and understanding, and if his behavior is consistently undermining hers, it's valid for her to seek a partner who aligns better with her values.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. Her feelings are justified based on the examples given. The answer should be B.\n"
