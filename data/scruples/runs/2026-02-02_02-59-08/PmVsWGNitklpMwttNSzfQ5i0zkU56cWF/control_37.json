My dad works and my mom stays home. However, they do not push this lifestyle on me and my sisters. They have stated that it\u2019s simply what works best for them and they have always stressed the importance of hard work and self-reliance. College is a must for us, we are expected to find a job, work hard, and pay for our own shit. They encourage us to pursue whatever we are interested in/good at, whether that be a traditionally feminine or masculine activity. I am so glad my parents raised me to be independent and self-sufficient, even if that means I have to work hard, because I feel very prepared to take on the future.\n\nMy bf also comes from a traditional family but his views are a lot different than mine. For example, when he found out that I mow lawns on the side during the summer to make some extra cash, he acted shocked and said if he were my dad, he would be ashamed of his daughter outside in the heat mowing his lawn, and if I needed extra money I should just ask him. I was offended by this because he insulted my dad and I actually like mowing lawns. I really do, I get to blast my music, be outside and get a decent work out in. And I don\u2019t need to pay for my gas and clothes with bfs money like some spoiled bitch. I told him all this and he just doesn\u2019t get it.\n\nHe also INSISTS on paying for EVERYTHING. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I really appreciate when guys pay on dates, it\u2019s a nice gesture and I am happy to let them do that. However, I feel like you have to draw the line at some point. I am not allowed to buy anything for him or else he throws a fit, even something little like a snack after basketball practice. Instead of making me feel appreciated it makes me feel incapable.\n\nLast weekend we went rock climbing together and I showed him up big time. He was super pissed about it and kept making all of these excuses for why I was doing better than him when I hadn\u2019t even said anything about how he, well, frankly, sucked. Later that night we were texting about our dream careers after college and he said that he would always be making more money than me, and he couldn\u2019t date a girl with a higher salary.\n\nI called him out on his ignorance and he quickly apologized for the comment, but that whole day was just sort of the final straw with this guy. I have a feeling he just apologized to avoid an argument and he still really feels that way, and I am tired of constantly being treated like a princess. On the other hand, in his eyes he is being a man and respectful by treating me this way. I know I can be independent to a fault and idk, maybe I\u2019m being overly sensitive to the whole thing. \n\nSo, AITA for getting \u201ctriggered\u201d and thinking he\u2019s sexist and we should break up, or am I right to think this dude is too 50s for me?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for thinking her boyfriend is sexist and wanting to break up with him. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the situation from both sides. The author (18F) comes from a traditional family but her parents are supportive of her independence. She works, mows lawns, and is self-sufficient. Her boyfriend, on the other hand, has traditional views. He's upset she mows lawns, insists on paying for everything, and made a comment about not dating a woman who earns more than him. \n\nShe's offended by his comments and actions. She likes mowing lawns because it's fun for her, and she doesn't want to rely on him for money. He calls her dad's job into question and gets upset when she outperforms him in rock climbing. He apologizes when caught, but she feels he's not sincere and still holds sexist views.\n\nNow, the key points here are about gender roles and mutual respect. The boyfriend's behavior seems to stem from traditional gender norms that the author finds problematic. He's not respecting her autonomy and independence, which are important to her. His insistence on paying for everything and his reaction to her career aspirations suggest a belief that men should be the primary earners and women should be financially dependent. That's a classic sexist viewpoint.\n\nThe author is standing up for her values, which her parents instilled in her. She's not being overly sensitive; she's setting boundaries because his behavior conflicts with her need for independence. The boyfriend's apologies might be insincere, as he doesn't seem to understand her perspective. \n\nIn a healthy relationship, both partners should respect each other's values and work through differences. If the boyfriend isn't willing to adapt or understand her stance, it's a red flag. The author is justified in feeling that his views are incompatible with hers. Therefore, she's not in the wrong for wanting to end the relationship because of his sexist attitudes.\n"
