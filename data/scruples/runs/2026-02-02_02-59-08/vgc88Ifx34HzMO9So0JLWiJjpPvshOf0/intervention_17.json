Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by reading the situation carefully.\n\nThe author is engaged to someone who is unvaccinated. They had discussed alternative vaccine schedules before the engagement, maybe even following a different country's schedule. The fianc\u00e9e is against vaccines in general, especially the Hep B vaccine at birth because she doesn't see how a baby would contract it. The author, being a healthcare worker, is concerned about the risk of the baby getting sick from others. The author gives an ultimatum that the baby can't wait more than a month before starting some alternative schedule. The fianc\u00e9e is now upset, calling the author manipulative and abusive for giving ultimatums. She had agreed before to work towards vaccination but has changed her mind. The author is frustrated because they've shown data from WHO and CDC, but she's still not convinced, citing big pharma conspiracies and that vaccines don't work. The author is now asking if they're in the wrong for walking away if she doesn't agree.\n\nHmm. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, both parties had discussed vaccines before engagement. The author knew the fianc\u00e9e was unvaccinated and they agreed on a compromise of an alternative schedule. Now, after a month, she's more opposed. The author is a healthcare worker, which might influence their stance. They're setting a firm boundary, which can be seen as an ultimatum. The fianc\u00e9e feels pressured and accuses the author of being manipulative. \n\nOn one hand, the author is standing by their values and health beliefs. On the other hand, giving an ultimatum over a significant issue like vaccines can be seen as extreme. The author might be overstepping by not allowing any flexibility beyond the one-month delay. The fianc\u00e9e's change of heart could be due to her own evolving beliefs or fear of medical procedures. \n\nBut the author had set boundaries from the start and tried to find a middle ground. The fianc\u00e9e agreed initially but is now resisting. The author is trying to protect the child's health based on their professional background. However, ultimatums in relationships can be destructive, even if the issue is important. The key here is whether the author's approach was reasonable given the prior agreement and the fianc\u00e9e's current stance.\n\nThe author might not be in the wrong because they had warned her beforehand and tried to find a compromise. But giving an ultimatum can strain a relationship, especially if one partner feels forced to comply. However, if the author is prepared to walk away because the fianc\u00e9e won't meet them halfway, it might be a matter of differing values. The fianc\u00e9e's refusal to accept any vaccination, despite evidence, could be a deal-breaker for the author.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a nuanced situation. The author isn't wrong for standing by their stance, but the way they present it as an ultimatum might be problematic. However, since they had discussed it before and the fianc\u00e9e changed her mind, maybe the author is justified in holding their ground. But I have to consider if giving an ultimatum is inherently wrong regardless of the issue. Sometimes in relationships, non-negotiable issues are discussed, and if one party can't meet them, the relationship ends. So perhaps the author isn't in the wrong. But the answer might depend on cultural or personal beliefs about compromise in relationships. I'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong (B), but I'm a bit conflicted because ultimatums can be seen as harsh. However, given the context of prior agreement and the importance of the issue, maybe it's justified.\n"
