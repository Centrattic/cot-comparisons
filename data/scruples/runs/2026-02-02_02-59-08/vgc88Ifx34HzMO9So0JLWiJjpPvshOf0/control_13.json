Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong for giving an ultimatum about vaccines to their fianc\u00e9e. So, I need to analyze the situation and decide whether the author is at fault.\n\nFirst, the background: The fianc\u00e9e was unvaccinated before the engagement. They discussed alternative schedules, maybe from another country, to ease her concerns about overloading the baby. They agreed the kids would be vaccinated. Now, after a month, she's bringing up her strong opposition again, especially against the Hep B vaccine at birth. The author, a healthcare worker, is giving her an ultimatum: either follow a modified schedule starting after a month or the author might walk away. The fianc\u00e9e is upset, calling it manipulative and abusive.\n\nSo, the key points here. The author made their stance clear from the start. They tried to compromise with alternative schedules. Now they're setting a boundary because the fianc\u00e9e is backtracking on their agreement and is anti-vax, despite evidence. The author is a healthcare worker, which adds credibility to their pro-vaccine stance. The fianc\u00e9e is not just hesitant but believes vaccines are a hoax, despite data showing effectiveness. The ultimatum is that the author can't go beyond a one-month delay. The fianc\u00e9e is now upset and accusing the author of being manipulative.\n\nIs the author wrong? Well, giving an ultimatum in a relationship is a big step. But the author mentions that they discussed this before, and the fianc\u00e9e initially agreed. Now she's changing her stance. The author is standing by their non-negotiable line. The question is about whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nIn relationships, it's important that both partners can meet in the middle. If one partner can't budge on a core value, it's a significant issue. The author's stance is about the health of their future children. The fianc\u00e9e's refusal to accept even a modified schedule, despite evidence and prior agreement, might indicate she's not willing to compromise. The author is trying to protect their children's health, which is a valid concern. However, giving an ultimatum can be seen as extreme, but if the other person is unwilling to compromise, maybe it's justified.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9e's arguments are based on misinformation, and she's not engaging with factual data. The author has tried to reason with her but she's not budging. So the author is trying to set a boundary where they can't compromise further. In that case, maybe the author isn't in the wrong because they're standing up for their core belief, which is about their children's health. The fianc\u00e9e's unwillingness to meet even a modified schedule might make the ultimatum necessary. \n\nBut maybe the author could have found another way to handle it, but the question is about being in the wrong. Since the author made their stance clear from the start, and they tried to compromise, but the fianc\u00e9e is now not honoring the previous agreement, the author's ultimatum is a last resort. So the answer might be that the author is not in the wrong.\n"
