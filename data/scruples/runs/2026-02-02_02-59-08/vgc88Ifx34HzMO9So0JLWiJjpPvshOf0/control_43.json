Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a fianc\u00e9 giving an ultimatum regarding vaccines. Let me break down the details.\n\nFirst, the author knew their fianc\u00e9e was unvaccinated before proposing. They had previously discussed alternative schedules, maybe from another country, to ease her concerns about \"overloading the baby.\" They agreed the kids would be vaccinated but on some schedule. Now, after a month of engagement, she's bringing it up again, strongly against vaccines, especially the Hep B at birth. She's not in medical environments, so the risk seems low, but he's a healthcare worker and wants to minimize any risk. He's given her an ultimatum: either get the baby vaccinated within a month or he walks away. She's now upset, calling him manipulative and abusive. He tried showing her data from WHO and CDC, but she's still not convinced, thinking it's a big pharma scam. He's asking if he's in the wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are the ultimatum, the prior agreement, and the fianc\u00e9e's current stance. The author is firm on vaccinations, which he believes are safe and effective, and he's given her a choice. She's changed her position, and he's standing his ground. \n\nNow, considering ethical and moral grounds. Is it wrong to have strong beliefs about your children's health? Maybe not, especially if those beliefs are backed by scientific consensus. However, giving an ultimatum in a relationship can be a big deal. But in this case, the author mentions that they had already discussed this before and there was an agreement. Now she's backing out. The author is standing by his decision because he's in a healthcare field, so his concern about risk is more than just personal\u2014it's professional. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9e's arguments against vaccines are based on conspiracy theories and misinformation. The author has tried to counter with facts but she's not listening. In such cases, people have different thresholds for compromise. The author's offer to a delayed schedule (one month) seems like a middle ground. But she's refusing any vaccination schedule, which is the core issue. \n\nIs it wrong to walk away? The author isn't forcing her to do anything; he's stating his non-negotiable boundary. If the fianc\u00e9e can't meet that, then the relationship ends. In relationships, it's common for people to have deal-breakers, especially when it comes to children's health. The author isn't violating any terms of the engagement he had with her. She initially agreed to work towards vaccination, but now she's not. \n\nOn the flip side, some might argue that the ultimatum is harsh, but given the importance of vaccination (especially with scientific consensus), it's a valid stance. The author is not forcing her to believe in vaccines but is setting a boundary for their children. \n\nIn terms of manipulation or abuse, the fianc\u00e9e is the one who accused him of that. However, the author isn't coercing her; he's presenting his position and the consequences. If she can't accept his terms, then he can't proceed. That's not manipulation but setting clear expectations. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. He's standing by a prior agreement, has valid professional reasons, and is not forcing her to change her beliefs but is protecting his non-negotiables.\n"
