Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for giving an ultimatum about vaccines to his fianc\u00e9e. \n\nFirst, the background: They were already in a relationship, and before proposing, they discussed alternative vaccination schedules. They agreed the kids would be vaccinated, just maybe a different schedule. Now, after a month of engagement, the fianc\u00e9e is more opposed, especially to the Hep B vaccine at birth. The author is a healthcare worker, concerned about risks, and has given a firm deadline for an alternative schedule. The fianc\u00e9e feels manipulated and is upset, even though she previously agreed to work towards vaccination.\n\nThe author is a healthcare worker, so he has a professional stake in this. He's given a specific timeframe (one month) as his maximum flexibility. The fianc\u00e9e is now resistant, bringing up conspiracy theories and rejecting data. The author is considering walking away, hence the AITA question.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to evaluate both sides. \n\nFrom the author's perspective, he's standing by his values and profession. He's made compromises already by considering alternative schedules. He's clear about his boundaries to protect the child's health. He's not forcing her to vaccinate immediately but is setting a firm limit. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9e's side is that she initially agreed but is now more opposed. She's upset about the ultimatum, sees it as manipulative. She may be under pressure from a controlling partner, but her views on vaccines are extreme and not based on evidence. \n\nThe key points here are consent and communication. The author set his position early, and she was aware. The fianc\u00e9e's views have shifted, but the author is unwilling to compromise further. In relationships, both parties need to respect each other's boundaries. If one's dealbreaker is non-negotiable, it's their right to set that boundary. However, the author's ultimatum could be seen as abrupt, especially after a month of engagement when issues might have been expected to be resolved.\n\nBut the fianc\u00e9e has not changed her stance despite evidence. The author is trying to protect the child's health, which is a valid concern. The question is whether the ultimatum is too harsh. However, since they have a child-related decision that's fundamental, the author is within his rights to set a boundary. The fianc\u00e9e's resistance to all evidence might make the author's position more reasonable. \n\nSo, considering both sides, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. He's standing by his values and protecting the child. The fianc\u00e9e's refusal to budge despite initial agreement adds complexity, but the author's firm stance is his right. Therefore, answer B.\n"
