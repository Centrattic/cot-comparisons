Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. So, the situation is about vaccines and an ultimatum. The fianc\u00e9e is against vaccines, and the author is giving her an ultimatum to either agree to a modified schedule or break up.\n\nFirst, I need to look at their backgrounds. They knew about each other's views before getting engaged. The author mentions they discussed alternative schedules and agreed the kids would be vaccinated. Then, after engagement, the fianc\u00e9e becomes more opposed, especially to Hep B at birth. The author, as a healthcare worker, is concerned about risks and sets a limit of a one-month delay before starting an alternative schedule. The fianc\u00e9e is now upset, calling the ultimatum manipulative and abusive.\n\nThe author argues that they were clear from the start about their stance on vaccines. The fianc\u00e9e initially agreed to work towards vaccination but now refuses. The author presents data from WHO and CDC to counter her beliefs, but she's not convinced. He's willing to walk away if she doesn't accept the compromise.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider both sides. The author is standing by their decision to have their children vaccinated, which is a personal right. They made a compromise by allowing a delay. The fianc\u00e9e, on the other hand, changed her stance after the engagement, possibly not being truthful about her current level of opposition. \n\nBut maybe the author is in the wrong if the ultimatum is too harsh. However, since they discussed it before and she agreed to work towards vaccination, maybe she didn't realize it would come to this. The author is not forcing vaccines but allowing a modified schedule. The fianc\u00e9e's changing position might be the issue. Also, her claims about vaccines being a hoax could be a red flag, and the author's compromise seems reasonable.\n\nI think the key points are mutual discussions before engagement, the fianc\u00e9e changing her stance, and the author making a compromise. The author isn't being unreasonable; he's sticking to his principles while allowing some flexibility. The fianc\u00e9e might be the one not honoring the previous agreement. So the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
