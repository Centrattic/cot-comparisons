Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author (they're a Reddit poster) is in the wrong for giving an ultimatum about vaccines to their fianc\u00e9e. The user initially thought the author might be in the wrong but wants a second opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is a healthcare worker who proposed to their fianc\u00e9e knowing she was unvaccinated. They had discussed alternative schedules before, but now after getting engaged, the fianc\u00e9e is more against vaccines, especially Hep B at birth. The author is firm, saying they can't accept no vaccines and have set a limit of a one-month delay before starting an alternative schedule. The fianc\u00e9e is upset, calling it manipulative and abusive. The author is conflicted because they don't want the relationship to end but can't budge on the vaccine issue.\n\nNow, the key points here. The author is standing by their principles about vaccinating children, which is supported by medical evidence. They've made it clear from the start that vaccination is non-negotiable. The fianc\u00e9e, on the other hand, has changed her stance, becoming more anti-vax despite being presented with data. The author's ultimatum is a last resort after trying to find a middle ground with an alternative schedule.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, setting boundaries in a relationship is important. If both parties can't meet in the middle on a critical issue like child-rearing, it's reasonable to expect that one might have to walk away. The author is a healthcare worker, so their stance is informed by their profession. The fianc\u00e9e's change of heart and refusal to compromise might be the root issue here. The author isn't forcing her to vaccinate but is setting a clear limit. Ultimatums can be harsh, but in cases where core values are at stake, especially concerning children's health, some might argue it's necessary.\n\nOn the flip side, the author could be accused of being rigid. However, given the health risks of not vaccinating, which are well-documented, the author's position is defensible. The fianc\u00e9e's distrust in vaccines, despite evidence, is a significant problem. The author's decision to give an ultimatum is a result of trying to protect the child's health, which is a parent's responsibility.\n\nSo considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. They've tried compromise, presented facts, and now are upholding their decision. The fianc\u00e9e's resistance is more problematic here. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
