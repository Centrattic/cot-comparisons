Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for giving an ultimatum over vaccines to their fianc\u00e9e. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author knew the fianc\u00e9e was unvaccinated before proposing. They discussed alternative schedules, maybe from another country. They agreed the kids would be vaccinated. Now, after a month, the fianc\u00e9e is against vaccines entirely, especially Hep B. The author is a healthcare worker concerned about risks and sets a limit: the baby can't start vaccines until one month old, then follow an alternative schedule. The fianc\u00e9e is upset, calling the author manipulative. The author doesn't want to end the relationship but won't budge, leading to the ultimatum.\n\nSo, the key points are mutual initial agreement, the fianc\u00e9e's change of heart, and the author's ultimatum. The question is whether the author is wrong for this.\n\nFrom the author's side, they had prior discussions and made a compromise. They're standing by their non-negotiable stance on vaccines. The fianc\u00e9e, however, has become more opposed, denying vaccine effectiveness and citing conspiracy theories. The author is using logical arguments and data, which the fianc\u00e9e isn't accepting.\n\nLegally, both parents have rights, but in a relationship, decisions are mutual. If one parent refuses vaccines, it can be a conflict. The author is enforcing a compromise they thought was agreed upon, but the fianc\u00e9e isn't honoring that agreement. The author's ultimatum is a firm line in the sand, which might be necessary if they can't reach a middle ground.\n\nHowever, ultimatums can be seen as controlling. The author is a healthcare worker, which might make their stance more informed, but that doesn't automatically make it right. Relationships require compromise. If the fianc\u00e9e changed her mind, maybe the author should have revisited the discussion rather than an ultimatum. But given the fianc\u00e9e's refusal to consider data and the prior agreement, the author is protecting their values.\n\nThe problem is whether the author is wrong for setting a limit. If they had a prior agreement and the fianc\u00e9e is violating that, the author isn't wrong for enforcing it. However, if the agreement was vague, maybe the author is overstepping. The initial agreement was to follow some schedule, not necessarily full vaccination. The author adjusted to a delayed schedule, which is a compromise. If the fianc\u00e9e is against all vaccines, then the author's compromise might not be enough.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, both have to meet in the middle. If one parent refuses all vaccines, it's a major issue. The author is trying to find a middle ground but the fianc\u00e9e isn't budging. The author's stance is firm but based on prior agreement. So, I think the author isn't in the wrong because they tried to compromise and the fianc\u00e9e isn't honoring the agreement. The answer would be B.\n"
