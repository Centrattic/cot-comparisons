Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a fianc\u00e9 giving an ultimatum regarding vaccines. The user is asking if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, let's recap the details. The author knew their fianc\u00e9e was unvaccinated before proposing. They had discussed alternative schedules, maybe from another country. They agreed the kids would be vaccinated. Now, a month into engagement, she's bringing it up again, being more against vaccines, especially Hep B at birth. The author wants to start the schedule after a month, which they consider a maximum compromise. The fianc\u00e9e is upset, calling it manipulative and abusive. She initially agreed to work towards vaccination but now isn't. The author cites data from WHO and CDC, but she's still adamant, believing vaccines are a hoax and don't work. The author gives an ultimatum: take the modified schedule or leave it.\n\nNow, the key points to consider. The author had prior discussions, set boundaries, and tried to find a middle ground. The fianc\u00e9e, however, is now changing her stance and refusing to compromise. The author is in a healthcare role, which adds weight to their concern about risks. The fianc\u00e9e's arguments are based on misinformation, and she's not engaging with evidence presented. The ultimatum is about the author's non-negotiable line regarding their children's health.\n\nIs the author wrong for setting this boundary? Well, in a relationship, major decisions like vaccination are significant. If both partners can't agree on something they value highly, parting ways is a possible outcome. The author tried to accommodate by suggesting a delayed schedule but not full refusal. The fianc\u00e9e's refusal to budge, despite prior agreement, could be seen as the main issue here. \n\nHowever, ultimatums can be seen as harsh, even if justified. But in this case, the author is standing by a decision that's non-negotiable for them. The fianc\u00e9e's behavior might be contributing to the conflict by not being open to evidence and changing her position after initial agreement.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They've tried to find a compromise, set clear boundaries, and the fianc\u00e9e is the one not following through. The answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
