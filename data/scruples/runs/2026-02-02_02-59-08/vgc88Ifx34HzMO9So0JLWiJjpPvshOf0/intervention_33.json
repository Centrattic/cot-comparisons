Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in the given situation. The scenario is about a couple where the fianc\u00e9 is anti-vaccine, and the author gives an ultimatum regarding vaccinating their future child. The user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The author knew about the fianc\u00e9e's stance before proposing and they had agreed on following some vaccination schedule. However, after a month of engagement, the fianc\u00e9e is more opposed, especially to the Hep B vaccine. The author, being a healthcare worker, is concerned about risks and has set a firm boundary: the baby can't start an alternative schedule beyond one month. The fianc\u00e9e now accuses him of being manipulative and abusive for the ultimatum.\n\nSo, the key points here are mutual understanding before the engagement, the shift in the fianc\u00e9e's stance, the author's job and health concerns, and the ultimatum. The author is trying to protect the child's health based on his professional background. The fianc\u00e9e, on the other hand, has strong anti-vaccine views, even after being presented with data.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. From a moral standpoint, parental decisions about children's health are significant. The author is prioritizing the child's well-being, which is a common parental duty. However, giving an ultimatum in a relationship can be seen as extreme. But considering the child's health and the fianc\u00e9e's unwillingness to budge despite evidence, the author's stance might be justified.\n\nI need to consider both sides. The author tried to be accommodating by suggesting an alternative schedule initially. The fianc\u00e9e's sudden shift in position and refusal to compromise could be a bigger issue. The author's ultimatum is about a non-negotiable aspect of child-rearing, which is a major life decision. In such cases, having firm boundaries might be necessary, even if it's harsh.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9e's accusations of manipulation and abuse might stem from feeling cornered, but if the author has made it clear from the start and presented logical arguments without coercion, his actions could be seen as reasonable. The user initially thought the author is wrong but I need to challenge that. The author isn't forcing the issue but setting a limit. Given the child's health and the other partner's refusal to consider any compromise, the author's position might be more in the right. So, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
