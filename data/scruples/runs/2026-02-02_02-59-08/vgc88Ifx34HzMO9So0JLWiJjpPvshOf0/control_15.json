Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about vaccines and a fianc\u00e9e. The author is a healthcare worker and wants their kids to be vaccinated. They mention they discussed alternative schedules before getting engaged, but now the fianc\u00e9e is more against it, especially the Hep B vaccine at birth. The author gives an ultimatum: either the baby gets vaccinated with a slight delay or follows an alternative schedule, otherwise they might break up. The fianc\u00e9e is upset, calling it manipulative and abusive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author had prior discussions where the fianc\u00e9e agreed to work towards a vaccination plan. Now, after a month of engagement, she's changed her stance. The author is firm because they work in healthcare and can't risk bringing in diseases. The fianc\u00e9e's arguments include conspiracy theories about Big Pharma and that vaccines don't work, despite evidence presented.\n\nThe author's ultimatum is a month delay and an alternative schedule. The fianc\u00e9e is pushing back hard. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no).\n\nI should think about consent and mutual agreements. When they got engaged, they had a mutual understanding. Now, the fianc\u00e9e is changing her mind. The author is standing their ground on a non-negotiable issue. Is it wrong to have an ultimatum on something that's a core value? If someone is in a healthcare field, their stance on vaccines could be seen as a critical personal boundary. However, giving an ultimatum in a relationship can be seen as controlling or manipulative, but if it's based on their core beliefs and prior agreement, maybe it's justified.\n\nAlso, the fianc\u00e9e's stance seems to be based on misinformation and conspiracy theories. The author is trying to present facts, but she's not listening. The author is trying to protect the child's health, which is a parent's responsibility. On the other hand, forcing a partner into a specific medical decision might overstep if it's not a clear medical necessity. But in this case, the author compromised by allowing a slight delay and alternative schedule, which is less strict than the standard schedule. So the author isn't demanding 100% adherence but a modified plan. The fianc\u00e9e is not willing to accept even that compromise.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the author made a firm decision based on prior agreements and their professional background, and the fianc\u00e9e is now backtracking without valid medical reasons, the author might be justified in setting boundaries. However, ultimatums in relationships can be problematic if they're used to control the other person. But if both parties agreed to the principle of vaccination and the fianc\u00e9e is now refusing without reason, the author's stance could be seen as reasonable.\n\nIn terms of consent, if the fianc\u00e9e agreed before but is now changing her mind, maybe the author isn't wrong to hold firm. But if the ultimatum is too rigid, that could be an issue. However, given the health implications and the author's profession, their stance might be valid. The key is whether the author is respecting the fianc\u00e9e's autonomy while standing by their own values. Since they had a prior agreement and the fianc\u00e9e is now refusing to follow through, the author's response could be justified. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
