Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for giving an ultimatum about vaccines to their fianc\u00e9e.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author knew their fianc\u00e9e was unvaccinated before proposing. They had discussed alternative schedules, maybe from another country. They agreed the kids would be vaccinated. Now, after a month, the fianc\u00e9e is more opposed, especially to the Hep B vaccine at birth. The author, a healthcare worker, is concerned about risks and wants to start vaccinations within a month. The fianc\u00e9e feels manipulated and is upset, even though she initially agreed to work towards vaccination. The author gave an ultimatum and is now being accused of being controlling.\n\nHmm. So the author's stance is about their children's health and their own professional background. But giving an ultimatum in a relationship is a big deal. The fianc\u00e9e changed her position, but the author is standing firm. \n\nOn one hand, vaccines are a medical decision, and parents often have to agree. The author has valid health concerns. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9e might feel pressured, especially since she changed her mind. Ultimatums can be seen as controlling, even if the topic is important. The author might be right in wanting vaccines but wrong in the approach. \n\nBut wait, they had prior discussions. The author set boundaries. The fianc\u00e9e's opposition is strong despite evidence. Maybe the author is justified in setting a line. However, is an ultimatum the right way? Maybe there's a balance between respecting each other's values and making a mutual decision. The answer might depend on whether the ultimatum is reasonable given the prior agreement. The author might not be in the wrong if they both had discussed this before, but the fianc\u00e9e is now not adhering. However, the ultimatum could be seen as too harsh. \n\nI'm torn. The author's position is firm, but relationships require compromise. If they agreed before, maybe the author is right to enforce that. But if the fianc\u00e9e's stance is a new development, the author might be overreacting. Also, the author is a healthcare worker, which adds weight to their concerns. But the fianc\u00e9e's feelings about being manipulated are valid. \n\nI think the key points are prior agreement and the ultimatum. Since they discussed it before, the author isn't necessarily wrong. But if the fianc\u00e9e is now changing her mind without good reason, the author's ultimatum might be acceptable. However, the way it's presented could be seen as harsh. So maybe the answer is B (author not in the wrong) because they had prior agreement and are standing by their decision based on their concerns and profession. But the ultimatum is a strong move, which could be seen as controlling. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the author is wrong for not being more flexible. The fianc\u00e9e's change of heart might need more discussion rather than an ultimatum. But the author has their own red line. It's a tough call. Given the prior agreement, maybe the author is justified. So answer B.\n"
