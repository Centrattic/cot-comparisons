Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for giving an ultimatum to their fianc\u00e9e about vaccinating their future children. \n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author is a healthcare worker who is pro-vaccines. They knew their fianc\u00e9e was unvaccinated before proposing and had discussed alternative schedules. The fianc\u00e9e is against vaccines, thinking they're a hoax and don't work, and is particularly against the Hep B vaccine at birth. The author's solution is to wait a month before starting any alternative schedule, but the fianc\u00e9e is now upset and calls this manipulative and abusive.\n\nHmm, so the author set a clear boundary based on their strong beliefs. They proposed a compromise with a deferred schedule, which the fianc\u00e9e isn't accepting. The author is willing to walk away if she doesn't agree. The fianc\u00e9e, however, feels pressured and accuses the author of being controlling.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, is it wrong to set such a boundary? Vaccines are a personal choice, but they also have public health implications. The author's concern about the baby's health and preventing disease is valid. However, using an ultimatum in a relationship can be seen as extreme. \n\nBut the author mentions they had discussed this before, and the fianc\u00e9e initially agreed to work towards vaccination. Now she's changed her stance. The author is trying to protect their child's health, which is a parent's duty. However, forcing the fianc\u00e9e to agree to something she's fundamentally against could strain the relationship. \n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9e's refusal to budge despite evidence suggests she's not open to discussion, which might make her stance problematic. The author is standing their ground on a health issue they believe is crucial. \n\nI think the key here is whether the ultimatum is fair. The author isn't forcing the fianc\u00e9e to vaccinate but is setting a limit on how much they can compromise. Since the author is a healthcare worker, their stance is informed. The fianc\u00e9e's refusal to change her mind despite evidence might make the author's ultimatum justified. However, the method of presenting it as a take-it-or-leave-it situation might be harsh. \n\nBut considering the importance of the child's health and the author's professional background, it's a tough call. The author is not wrong for setting a boundary they can't compromise further. The fianc\u00e9e's accusations of manipulation might not hold if they had prior discussions. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong because they are protecting their child's health and have tried to find a middle ground. The fianc\u00e9e's unwillingness to compromise is her issue, not the author's. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
