Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about vaccines and a fianc\u00e9e. The author is a healthcare worker who's pro-vaccines, while the fianc\u00e9e is anti-vax. Before they got engaged, they discussed an alternative schedule, but now the fianc\u00e9e is more against it, especially the Hep B vaccine at birth. The author gave an ultimatum: either follow a modified schedule with a one-month deferral or break up.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author has a clear stance on vaccines, which is supported by medical evidence. They even mention their healthcare background, which adds credibility. They tried to find a middle ground with an alternative schedule, showing compromise. The fianc\u00e9e, on the other hand, is very anti-vax, believes in big pharma conspiracies, and refuses to budge despite presented evidence. She's upset about the ultimatum, calling it manipulative and abusive.\n\nThe key points here are consent and compromise. The author set boundaries and communicated them. They mentioned that they wouldn't compromise on their children being vaccinated, which is their right. The fianc\u00e9e agreed initially but changed her mind. The author's ultimatum is based on their non-negotiable stance, which is reasonable given their profession and the health risks involved. \n\nHowever, giving an ultimatum in a relationship can be seen as extreme. But considering the fianc\u00e9e's refusal to change her position despite evidence, the author might feel it's necessary. The question is whether the author is wrong for setting such a boundary. Since the author made it clear from the start and tried to compromise, it's a matter of personal values. The fianc\u00e9e's refusal to accept any vaccination schedule, even an alternative one, might make the ultimatum justified from the author's perspective.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong because they communicated their stance early, tried to find a solution, and the fianc\u00e9e didn't meet their minimum requirements. The answer should be B (No).\n"
