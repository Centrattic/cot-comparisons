Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong (AITA). The situation involves a fianc\u00e9 giving an ultimatum about vaccination to their partner.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author is a healthcare worker who is pro-vaccine and proposed an alternative schedule. They gave their fianc\u00e9e an ultimatum: either follow a modified schedule starting one month after birth or face the possibility of the relationship ending. The fianc\u00e9e is against vaccines entirely, citing conspiracy theories and distrust in pharmaceutical companies. She's now upset, calling the ultimatum manipulative and abusive.\n\nThe key points to consider are consent and compromise. The author mentions they discussed alternative schedules beforehand, but now the fianc\u00e9e is against vaccines altogether. The author is setting boundaries based on their values and profession. The fianc\u00e9e, however, isn't willing to budge despite evidence presented. \n\nIn relationships, both parties should respect each other's core values. Vaccination is a significant health decision. The author isn't forcing vaccination but is proposing a slightly delayed schedule. However, by making it an ultimatum, they're essentially saying this is non-negotiable. The fianc\u00e9e might feel pressured, especially if she's not on board with any vaccines. \n\nThe term \"ultimatum\" often has negative connotations, implying a threat. Even if the author believes it's for the child's best interest, framing it as a take-it-or-leave-it could be seen as controlling. The fianc\u00e9e might feel her autonomy is being disregarded, especially if she's deeply opposed to vaccines. \n\nHowever, the author has a right to protect their child's health. They\u2019re using their professional knowledge to make an informed decision. The compromise they offered (a one-month delay) might be reasonable, considering the fianc\u00e9e's initial openness to alternative schedules. \n\nThe conflict arises from differing values. The author isn't in the wrong for standing by their beliefs, but the ultimatum approach might be problematic in terms of how it's perceived. Relationships require mutual respect and negotiation. If one partner can't compromise on a core issue, it might lead to the breakdown of the relationship. \n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for setting boundaries, but the manner of the ultimatum could be seen as inflexible. However, given the significant health implications and the fianc\u00e9e's unwillingness to consider any vaccination, the author's stance might be justified. The answer hinges on whether the ultimatum is seen as a reasonable boundary or as an overreach.\n"
