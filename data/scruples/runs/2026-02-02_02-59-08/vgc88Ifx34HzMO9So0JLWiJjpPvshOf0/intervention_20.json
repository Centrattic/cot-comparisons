Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking whether the author (who's giving ultimatums about vaccines to their fianc\u00e9e) is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, context is key. The author knew their fianc\u00e9e was unvaccinated before proposing and they had discussed an alternative schedule. They agreed that the kids would be vaccinated, but now the fianc\u00e9e is more against it, especially the Hep B vaccine at birth. The author, a healthcare worker, is concerned about risks and sets a limit\u2014waiting a month before starting vaccines. The fianc\u00e9e is now upset, calling it manipulative and abusive, and the author is wondering if they're at fault.\n\nI need to consider both perspectives. The author has a clear stance on vaccines, backed by healthcare experience and data from WHO and CDC. They tried to meet halfway with an alternative schedule. However, the fianc\u00e9e's views are strong and based on distrust in big pharma. She's not budging, even when presented with evidence.\n\nThe author's ultimatum is about their non-negotiable line. But is giving an ultimatum inherently wrong? If both parties had agreed on a path before, and the fianc\u00e9e's stance has shifted without prior discussion, maybe the author is justified in setting boundaries. However, the ultimatum might come across as controlling, especially if the fianc\u00e9e feels pressured without room for discussion. The author mentions they tried to find middle ground, but the fianc\u00e9e's refusal to compromise is also a factor.\n\nAlso, the fianc\u00e9e's accusations of manipulation and abuse are serious. Even if the author's intent is to protect the child's health, the approach might be seen as coercive. The key is whether the author gave enough space for discussion or if the ultimatum was the first step. The author did mention discussing it beforehand and setting terms, but the fianc\u00e9e feels blindsided now.\n\nIn terms of ethical considerations, respecting autonomy is important. The author is prioritizing their values, but the fianc\u00e9e's concerns, though based on misinformation, are her personal beliefs. The author has a right to their stance, but using an ultimatum might not be the healthiest way to resolve such a conflict.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a tough call. They tried to find compromise but had to set a limit. However, the way the ultimatum was presented and the fianc\u00e9e's reaction suggest communication issues. The author might be justified in standing by their decision, but the method of presenting it could be problematic. However, given the pre-existing agreement and the author's profession, maybe they're not in the wrong. I think the answer leans more towards B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they had prior discussions and set clear boundaries. The fianc\u00e9e's shift in stance and refusal to engage with evidence complicates things, but the author's right to make decisions based on their values is valid.\n"
