Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a fianc\u00e9e who's against vaccines, and the author gives her an ultimatum. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that before proposing, they discussed alternative vaccine schedules. They agreed the kids would get vaccinated but maybe follow a different schedule. Now, after being engaged a month, the fianc\u00e9e is even more against it, especially the Hep B vaccine at birth. The author, as a healthcare worker, is concerned about the baby's health and wants to start vaccines within a month. The fianc\u00e9e is now calling the author manipulative and abusive for giving an ultimatum.\n\nThe author is clear about his stance on vaccines and had communicated that from the start. He says he's tried to provide data from reputable sources like WHO and CDC, but she's still not convinced. He's given her what he considers the maximum compromise\u2014starting the schedule a month later. But she's upset and the relationship is in jeopardy.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are: Did he have a right to set this boundary? Was the ultimatum reasonable? The author is making a choice about his children's health based on his beliefs and professional background. The fianc\u00e9e, on the other hand, has anti-vaccine views and isn't budging despite evidence. \n\nIt's important to consider that both partners have the right to their beliefs, but when it comes to health decisions for children, parents often have to agree. The author tried to find a middle ground (alternative schedule, deferred start) but she's not willing to meet him halfway now. The ultimatum might be seen as a last resort to protect the child's health, especially since the author is in a healthcare field. \n\nHowever, some might argue that giving an ultimatum is extreme, but given the circumstances, if they can't agree on such a critical issue, maybe it's necessary. The fianc\u00e9e's initial agreement to work towards vaccination but now being vehemently against it complicates things. The author isn't forcing her to vaccinate; he's setting a boundary on how much he can compromise. \n\nIn terms of manipulation or abuse, it's more about differing values and non-negotiables. The author isn't threatening her directly but stating his limits. The fianc\u00e9e's reaction might stem from feeling pressured, but the author's stance is also about protecting the child. \n\nSo, I think the author is not in the wrong. He's standing by his beliefs after trying to find a compromise. The fianc\u00e9e's change in stance and refusal to budge might be the root issue here. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
