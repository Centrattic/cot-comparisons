Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a fianc\u00e9 making an ultimatum about vaccines.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author knew their fianc\u00e9e was unvaccinated before proposing and they had discussed alternative schedules. They agreed the kids would be vaccinated. Now, the fianc\u00e9e is more against it, especially the Hep B vaccine at birth. The author is a healthcare worker concerned about risks and set a one-month delay as the max. The fianc\u00e9e feels manipulated and is upset. The author is considering walking away if she doesn't agree.\n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. The question is whether the author is in the wrong, with options A or B. \n\nLooking at the situation: the author stood by their values but gave some flexibility (alternative schedule, one-month delay). They tried to compromise. The fianc\u00e9e changed her stance, became more anti-vax, and the author feels they can't compromise further. The author's actions are based on their own beliefs and profession, which they communicated early on. However, setting an ultimatum can be seen as extreme, especially in a relationship. But the author is trying to protect their future children's health. \n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9e might feel pressured, especially if she's not anti-vax as much as hesitant. The author's approach could be seen as dismissive of her concerns. But the author did try to find a middle ground. \n\nI think it's a tough call. The author isn't forcing vaccination but setting a boundary. The fianc\u00e9e's refusal to accept any schedule is causing the conflict. In relationships, differing values can lead to breaking points. The author isn't in the wrong for standing by their non-negotiable, especially since they communicated it early. The fianc\u00e9e's change of heart and anti-vax stance is leading to the conflict. So the answer might be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
