Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person in the Reddit post is in the wrong for giving an ultimatum about vaccines to their fianc\u00e9e. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The fianc\u00e9e was unvaccinated before they got engaged. They had discussed alternative schedules, and agreed that the kids would be vaccinated. Now, after a month of engagement, she's more against it, especially the Hep B vaccine. The author, a healthcare worker, is firm on vaccinations, gives her an ultimatum that the baby can't start an alternative schedule beyond one month, and she's upset, calling it manipulative.\n\nSo the author is trying to make a decision that's important to them and setting a boundary. They mention they've discussed this before, and the fianc\u00e9e agreed to work towards it but now isn't. The author is using data from WHO and CDC, but she's not convinced. The key here is whether the ultimatum is reasonable given their prior agreement and the author's strong stance on vaccines.\n\nFrom a relationship perspective, ultimatums can be tricky. However, the author is standing by a decision that's crucial for them, especially involving healthcare of their future children. They've given some flexibility with the alternative schedule, but have a limit. The fianc\u00e9e's change of heart and refusal to compromise might make the author's stance defensible. \n\nBut there's also the aspect of communication. Did they approach this in a way that's respectful? The author says they discussed it before, so maybe they've given her space to reconsider. The fianc\u00e9e's reaction could be emotional, but the author is firm. Whether the author is in the wrong depends on if the ultimatum is fair and if they've been consistent. Since they had prior agreement and she's now backtracking, the author isn't necessarily wrong in setting that boundary. \n\nSo, considering the prior discussion, the author's profession, and the fact that the fianc\u00e9e's position has shifted, the answer would lean towards B (the author is not in the wrong). They're standing by their values and the agreed-upon compromise they had before. The fianc\u00e9e's change in stance might be the more problematic factor here.\n"
