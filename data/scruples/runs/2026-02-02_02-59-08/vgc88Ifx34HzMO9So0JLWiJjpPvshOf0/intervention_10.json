Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong regarding a vaccine ultimatum given to his fianc\u00e9e. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The fianc\u00e9e was unvaccinated before the engagement, and they had discussed alternative vaccine schedules. The author proposed following some sort of schedule, but now the fianc\u00e9e is more against vaccines, specifically the Hep B at birth. The author, a healthcare worker, sets an ultimatum: if the baby isn't vaccinated within a month, he can't continue the relationship. The fianc\u00e9e feels manipulated and abusive.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, he made his stance clear from the start. He tried to compromise by allowing an alternative schedule but has a hard limit. The fianc\u00e9e's position has shifted from being open to working towards vaccination to being firmly against it, despite evidence. The author is standing by his non-negotiable boundary. \n\nBut ultimatums can be problematic in relationships. Giving someone an all-or-nothing choice might be seen as extreme, especially in a committed engagement. However, the author feels that his position is based on health and safety, given his profession. The fianc\u00e9e's refusal to accept any vaccination, even with evidence, is a significant point of conflict. \n\nOn one hand, the author is protecting his values and the child's health. On the other, imposing an ultimatum could be seen as controlling if he's not willing to consider any middle ground. But he did offer an alternative schedule initially. Now, he's set a firm line. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9e's reaction might be influenced by her own beliefs and the emotional weight of the situation. However, the author isn't forcing her to vaccinate; he's stating that he can't proceed without that agreement. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's about whose boundaries are more non-negotiable. If the author's decision is based on his core values and his professional understanding, it's a matter of personal ethics. The fianc\u00e9e might feel disrespected, but he's not violating any laws or unethical standards. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author is not in the wrong. He's standing by his decision after compromises. The answer is B.\n"
