Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for giving an ultimatum to his fianc\u00e9e about vaccinating their future children. Hmm.\n\nFirst, some background: The fianc\u00e9e is unvaccinated and against vaccines, especially the Hep B vaccine at birth. The author, a healthcare worker, wants their kids vaccinated. They had prior discussions about alternative schedules, but after the engagement, she's become more opposed. The author gives an ultimatum\u2014either follow a modified schedule within a month or face a breakup. She's now upset, calling him manipulative and abusive.\n\nSo, the key points here. The author made his stance clear from the start. They discussed alternatives before, but she's now doubling down against vaccines despite evidence. He's setting a boundary based on his professional experience and health concerns. She's not budging, even when presented with data. He's trying to compromise by allowing a delayed schedule, but she's not accepting that. \n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. On one hand, ultimatums can be heavy-handed. But he's standing by his non-negotiable about vaccinations, which is a significant parenting decision. He's given some flexibility (alternative schedule with a one-month delay) but can't compromise further. She's changed her position post-engagement, which complicates things. He's a healthcare worker, so his concerns might be more informed. She's resistant to evidence and sees vaccines as a conspiracy, which is a strong stance. \n\nIn relationships, major disagreements on parenting can be deal-breakers. The author is prioritizing his values and the child's health. But forcing a break up over this might be extreme. However, if she's unwilling to meet him halfway, he's not the one backing down. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong here. He's clear about his stance from the beginning, tried to find a middle ground, and she's not compromising. His decision to set a firm boundary is his right. So, answer B.\n"
