Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for giving an ultimatum about vaccines to their fianc\u00e9e. I need to analyze the situation carefully.\n\nFirst, background: The fianc\u00e9e was unvaccinated before engagement. They discussed alternative schedules, like different countries' schedules. They agreed the kids would be vaccinated. Now, after a month of engagement, she's more against it, especially Hep B at birth. The author, a healthcare worker, is concerned about risks and wants to start vaccines within a month. The fianc\u00e9e is upset, calling it manipulative and abusive. The author says they discussed this at the start, and she agreed to work towards it, but now she's refusing. He's given her an ultimatum, and she's upset about walking away.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The author set boundaries based on his beliefs and profession. They had prior discussions, so there was some agreement. Now, the fianc\u00e9e's stance has hardened, leading to conflict. The author is firm because he's concerned about health, even if the risk is low. The fianc\u00e9e feels pressured and accuses him of being manipulative.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, people have the right to set boundaries for their children's health. However, ultimatums in relationships can be contentious. The author is standing by his convictions, but the fianc\u00e9e feels it's abusive. It's possible both have valid points. The author isn't forcing her to vaccinate, just ensuring their children do. Since they're engaged, they might not be legally bound yet, but relationships require mutual respect. If she's unwilling to compromise, even with alternative schedules, the author is left with a choice. But is he wrong for setting that boundary?\n\nAlternatively, could the author have handled it differently? Maybe. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. Considering that he's a healthcare worker and the fianc\u00e9e's stance is against evidence, some might say he's justified. Others might argue that an ultimatum isn't the right approach in a relationship. However, given the context of prior agreement and the author's concerns, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong). But I need to make sure there's no nuance I'm missing. The key is whether imposing his will is wrong. Since it's about children's health and he's not forcing her to vaccinate herself, but the children, it's a parental decision. If they can't agree, then he's not in the wrong for setting that as a deal-breaker. So probably B.\n"
