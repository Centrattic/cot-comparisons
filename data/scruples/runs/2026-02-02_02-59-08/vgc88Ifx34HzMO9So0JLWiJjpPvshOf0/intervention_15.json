Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a fianc\u00e9e who is unvaccinated and against vaccines, and the author gives her an ultimatum about vaccinating their future children. The author is a healthcare worker and has set a strict condition that the kids must be vaccinated, with a slight delay for an alternative schedule. The fianc\u00e9e is upset, calling it manipulative and abusive.\n\nSo, the key points here: The author knew about her stance on vaccines before proposing and had discussed alternative schedules. After engagement, she became more opposed, leading the author to set an ultimatum. The fianc\u00e9e feels pressured, while the author believes he's standing his ground on a health issue.\n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, the author is firm about his beliefs regarding vaccination, which is important for public health. He's in a position where he's a healthcare worker, so his concern about potential risks is valid. He also tried to compromise by allowing a delayed schedule. On the other hand, giving an ultimatum in a relationship can be seen as extreme. The fianc\u00e9e might feel that her autonomy is being disregarded, especially if she's not convinced by the evidence presented. \n\nThe author mentions that she's been resistant to evidence, believing vaccines are a hoax. That's a significant point. If someone is set against scientific consensus despite evidence, it's challenging for the other partner to find a middle ground. However, using an ultimatum might not be the healthiest approach in a relationship, as it could be perceived as controlling. \n\nBut then again, when it comes to medical decisions for children, there's a responsibility to protect their health. The author might feel that he can't compromise on something so critical. The fianc\u00e9e's change of heart after engagement could also be a factor. The author had warned her earlier about his stance, so maybe she didn't fully consider the implications. \n\nI think the author's position is understandable given his profession and the importance of vaccines. However, the way he's handling it\u2014giving an ultimatum\u2014might be crossing a line, even if his intentions are good. It's a tough spot for both people. But considering that he's standing by his convictions and trying to protect future children, perhaps he's not in the wrong. The fianc\u00e9e's reaction might be part of her resistance to the issue, but the author has the right to set boundaries regarding his children's health.\n"
