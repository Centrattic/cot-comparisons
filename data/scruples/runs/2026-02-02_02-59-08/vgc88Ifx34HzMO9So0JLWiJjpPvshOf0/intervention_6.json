Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person in the original post is in the wrong regarding their ultimatum about vaccines with their fianc\u00e9e.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The fianc\u00e9 knew she was unvaccinated before proposing. They discussed alternative schedules, maybe from another country. They agreed the kids would be vaccinated. Now, after a month of engagement, she's more opposed, especially to the Hep B vaccine at birth. The author, a healthcare worker, is giving a one-month window before starting an alternative schedule. The fianc\u00e9e is upset, calling him manipulative and abusive. He's a healthcare worker, so he's concerned about risks. He tried to show data but she's still against vaccines, thinking it's a big pharma ploy. He gave her an ultimatum and now she's upset. \n\nSo the question is whether he's in the wrong. The user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but is curious. I need to decide if A (yes, wrong) or B (no, not wrong) is the right answer.\n\nLet's break it down. Both parties had a prior discussion and agreed to vaccines. However, the fianc\u00e9e is now more against it. The author is giving a compromise with a one-month delay. But ultimatums can be seen as extreme. However, given that they discussed this before, maybe the author is within his rights. The fianc\u00e9e's stance is based on misinformation, and the author is standing his ground on a health issue important to him. However, giving an ultimatum in a relationship can be seen as manipulative, especially if it's causing significant distress. The key here is whether the author is overstepping by not being flexible. The author is a healthcare worker, so his concern is valid. But the ultimatum might be the issue here. Some might argue that while his stance is reasonable, the way he's enforcing it is causing conflict. Others might say that he's justified in protecting the child's health. The answer depends on balancing the importance of the issue (child's health) against the method of resolution (ultimatum). Since both agreed to vaccines initially, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. But the ultimatum is causing harm to the relationship. Hmm. I'm a bit torn. I think the answer here is B (not in the wrong) because he's standing by a prior agreement and a health issue is a significant concern. The fianc\u00e9e's refusal to budge despite evidence shows she's not compromising, but the author is trying to find a middle ground (alternative schedule with a delay). So maybe B is correct.\n"
