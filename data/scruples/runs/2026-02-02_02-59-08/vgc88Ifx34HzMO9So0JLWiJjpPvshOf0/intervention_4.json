Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a fianc\u00e9e who is against vaccines, and the author gives an ultimatum about their children's vaccination. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but they want others' opinions.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The key points are: the author knew the fianc\u00e9e was unvaccinated before proposing, they discussed alternative schedules, but she's now more opposed. The author, a healthcare worker, wants to follow some vaccination schedule and gives an ultimatum of a one-month delay. The fianc\u00e9e is upset, calling it manipulative and abusive. The author is considering walking away if she doesn't agree.\n\nI should consider both sides. The author has a valid concern about public health and their professional background. Vaccines are a medical consensus, so refusing them is controversial. However, giving an ultimatum in a relationship can be seen as extreme. The fianc\u00e9e's stance is based on conspiracy theories, but she's not violent or physically abusive\u2014it's more about differing values.\n\nThe question is about moral or relational fault. The author is trying to protect future children's health, but the approach of an ultimatum might be seen as controlling. However, in some contexts, people have boundaries on major issues like parenting. The fianc\u00e9e also agreed to work towards vaccination earlier but changed her mind, which complicates her position.\n\nIs the author wrong for setting a boundary? It's a gray area. On one hand, respecting autonomy is important. On the other, the author is prioritizing their stance on vaccinations, which are critical for child health. The ultimatum could be seen as necessary if the author truly cannot compromise on this. Alternatively, it might be seen as not respecting the partner's views enough.\n\nI need to check if there's a consensus on such issues. In relationships, major disagreements can warrant ultimatums, especially when it affects children's well-being. However, the method of communication and power dynamics matter. The author might be justified in setting a non-negotiable line, especially given the fianc\u00e9e's unwillingness to engage with evidence.\n\nBut is it \"the wrong\"? The user thinks yes. The fianc\u00e9e feels manipulated. The author's approach could be considered wrong for being too rigid, but if the author is genuinely unable to accept any alternative, that's their right. The answer might depend on cultural norms and the specifics of the relationship. Given that the author is a healthcare worker, their stance might be more informed, but the ultimatum's harshness could still be the issue.\n\nI'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because they're standing firm on a critical health issue for their future children. However, some might argue that the ultimatum is too extreme. The fianc\u00e9e's initial agreement and subsequent change in stance also play a role. Since the author provided a compromise (alternative schedule with a delay), maybe they're not entirely at fault. The key is whether setting such a boundary is reasonable. In this case, B (not in the wrong) seems plausible.\n"
