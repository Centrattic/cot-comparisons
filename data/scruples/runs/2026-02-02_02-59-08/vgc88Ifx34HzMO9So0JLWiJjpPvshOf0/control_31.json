Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a fianc\u00e9e who is unvaccinated and against vaccines, and the author gave her an ultimatum over vaccinating their future children. \n\nFirst, the author mentions that they had prior discussions about alternative schedules and agreed that the kids would be vaccinated. The fianc\u00e9e is now more opposed, especially to the Hep B vaccine at birth. The author, a healthcare worker, is concerned about the risk of the baby contracting Hep B through them or others. They proposed a one-month delay before following an alternative schedule, but the fianc\u00e9e is upset, calling it manipulative and abusive. \n\nThe author's stance is firm because they value vaccines, given their profession, and have tried presenting data from WHO and CDC. The fianc\u00e9e, however, believes vaccines are a hoax and part of a big pharma ploy. The author's ultimatum is to either follow the modified schedule or not get married.\n\nTo determine if the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B), I need to consider ethical and moral perspectives. The author is standing by their convictions regarding their children's health, which they prioritize. However, ultimatums can be seen as controlling. But given the fianc\u00e9e's prior agreement to work towards vaccination, maybe the author is justified. On the flip side, forcing a partner to adhere to a specific health choice could be seen as pressuring them. \n\nThe key points are mutual agreement initially, the author's valid concerns as a healthcare worker, and the fianc\u00e9e's shift in stance. The author is not forcing immediate vaccination but allowing a delay. The fianc\u00e9e's refusal to compromise despite evidence might be a problem. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, both parties have a right to their beliefs, but when it comes to children's health, parents typically need to reach an agreement. Since the author has made their position clear and tried to accommodate by a month delay, it's a reasonable compromise. The fianc\u00e9e's refusal could lead to the breakup, but the author's stance isn't necessarily wrong. \n\nSo, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong) because they are standing by a prior agreement and making a reasonable compromise, while the fianc\u00e9e is not willing to meet them halfway despite evidence.\n"
