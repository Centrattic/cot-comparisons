Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for giving an ultimatum about vaccines to their fianc\u00e9e. I need to analyze the situation from both perspectives.\n\nFirst, the author knew their fianc\u00e9e was unvaccinated before proposing. They discussed alternative schedules and agreed the kids would be vaccinated. Now, after a month of engagement, the fianc\u00e9e is more against vaccines, especially Hep B at birth. The author, a healthcare worker, is concerned about risks and wants a modified schedule but not to delay more than a month. They gave an ultimatum, leading to the fianc\u00e9e feeling manipulated.\n\nThe key points here are the initial agreement versus the current stance. The fianc\u00e9e changed her position, which the author might not have anticipated. The author is firm on vaccination, which is a valid health concern. However, giving an ultimatum can be seen as extreme, especially if the fianc\u00e9e feels pressured. The author's stance is based on health data and professional experience, but the fianc\u00e9e's trust in big pharma and alternative views are deeply held beliefs. The ultimatum might not respect her autonomy, even if the author's intention is to protect the child. Relationships require compromise, and this ultimatum could be seen as not allowing further discussion or compromise, which might be why the author is in the wrong. However, the author's position is also about protecting the child's health, which is a valid concern. Balancing these factors, it's a tough call. The initial agreement was about following some schedule, but the fianc\u00e9e's shift to complete opposition and the author's firm stance without flexibility might place the author in the wrong. So, answer A.\n"
