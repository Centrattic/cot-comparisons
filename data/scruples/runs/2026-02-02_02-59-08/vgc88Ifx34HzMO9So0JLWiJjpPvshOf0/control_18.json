Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for giving an ultimatum about vaccines to their fianc\u00e9e. Let me break down the details.\n\nThe author mentions they knew their fianc\u00e9e was unvaccinated before proposing. They discussed alternative schedules, maybe from another country, but agreed the kids would be vaccinated. Now, after a month of engagement, the fianc\u00e9e is more against vaccines, especially the Hep B at birth. The author is a healthcare worker and has concerns about risk, so they set a limit: the baby can't start any alternative schedule after one month. The fianc\u00e9e is upset, calling it manipulative and abusive. The author tried to present data from WHO and CDC, but she's still not convinced, citing big pharma conspiracies and vaccines not working.\n\nSo the question is, is the author in the wrong? I need to consider both perspectives. The author is standing firm on their values regarding vaccines, which they've previously discussed. They're a healthcare worker, so their stance has some credibility. They're trying to compromise by allowing an alternative schedule but with a time limit. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9e feels pressured and accuses the author of being manipulative. She might feel that her views are being dismissed, even if she hasn't changed her stance. \n\nIs it wrong to have an ultimatum on such a significant issue? Vaccines are a major decision affecting a child's health. The author is trying to protect the child's health based on their profession and research. But marriage requires compromise on both sides. If the fianc\u00e9e was on board initially but now refuses to budge, maybe the author is justified in setting boundaries. However, some might argue that giving an ultimatum is extreme, especially if the fianc\u00e9e feels it's not respectful. But since they discussed this before, and the author made their position clear, perhaps it's reasonable for the author to enforce their limits. \n\nAlso, considering the fianc\u00e9e's views are based on misinformation (like big pharma conspiracy), the author is trying to make an evidence-based decision. It's a tough spot where personal values and health choices clash. The author's compromise (allowing a deferred schedule for a month) shows some flexibility. If the fianc\u00e9e refuses any vaccination entirely, the author might have a right to prioritize the child's health as per their beliefs. \n\nIn summary, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because they've tried to compromise and made their stance clear. The fianc\u00e9e's refusal to accept any vaccination despite evidence could make the ultimatum a necessary step for the author. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
