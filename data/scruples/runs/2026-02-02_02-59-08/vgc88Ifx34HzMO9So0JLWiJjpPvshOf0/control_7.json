Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong. The situation is about a fianc\u00e9e who was unvaccinated and the author setting an ultimatum regarding vaccinating their future children.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points of the story. The author knew the fianc\u00e9e's stance on vaccines before proposing and had discussed alternative schedules. They agreed that the kids would be vaccinated. Now, after a month, the fianc\u00e9e is more resistant, especially to the Hep B vaccine. The author, a healthcare worker, is concerned about risks and wants the baby vaccinated within the first month. The fianc\u00e9e is upset, calling the author manipulative and abusive for the ultimatum. The author is trying to stick to their decision, using data from reputable sources, but she's not budging.\n\nSo the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The author set boundaries based on their values and concerns for the child's health. They tried to compromise with an alternative schedule initially, but now the fianc\u00e9e is backtracking. The author is a healthcare worker, which probably reinforces their confidence in vaccines. The fianc\u00e9e, on the other hand, has anti-vax beliefs, even after being presented with data. The ultimatum is a serious decision, but the author isn't forcing her to get vaccinated themselves, just setting a limit for their child's vaccines.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's about personal choice and respect. The author isn't forcing her to take vaccines but is standing firm on their own values. Since vaccines are a personal/medical choice, but when it comes to children, parents often agree on medical decisions. The author is making a firm decision because they can't compromise further. The fianc\u00e9e is upset because the ultimatum feels controlling, but the author isn't being physically abusive or manipulative in a malicious way. They're stating their non-negotiable line. The fact that they had prior discussions and even considered alternative schedules shows they tried to meet halfway. The fianc\u00e9e's change in stance might be a reason for the author's firmness. \n\nIn relationships, when core values or non-negotiables are involved, it's reasonable to set boundaries. While ultimatums can be harsh, if the author's stance is a fundamental part of their values (like ensuring their child's health), it's not inherently wrong. The key is that the author isn't infringing on the fianc\u00e9e's autonomy in her own health but is making a decision for the child. The fianc\u00e9e's opposition is based on misinformation, and the author is trying to protect the child. So the author isn't in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
