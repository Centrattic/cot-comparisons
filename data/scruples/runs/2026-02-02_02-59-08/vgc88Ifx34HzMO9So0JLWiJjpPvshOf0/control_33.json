Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the fianc\u00e9) is in the wrong for giving an ultimatum over vaccines. The situation is that the fianc\u00e9e is unvaccinated and strongly against vaccinations, even after prior agreements. The author is a healthcare worker and wants their children to be vaccinated, offering a maximum of a one-month delay before starting an alternative schedule. The fianc\u00e9e is now upset, calling the ultimatum manipulative and abusive, despite having agreed earlier.\n\nFirst, consider the key points. The author knew her stance beforehand and had discussions. They compromised on an alternative schedule. Now, she's changed her mind. The author is standing firm on their boundary. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, personal boundaries in relationships are important. If someone has non-negotiable values, especially regarding health, they have the right to set those. The fianc\u00e9e initially agreed but changed her position. The author is not forcing her to vaccinate; they offered a modified schedule. However, the ultimatum might be seen as extreme if the alternative is acceptable. But given the fianc\u00e9e's refusal to budge, the author's stance could be justified to protect the child's health.\n\nOn the other hand, giving an ultimatum could be seen as extreme, especially in a new engagement. However, the author tried to find middle ground. The fianc\u00e9e's refusal to consider evidence and her strong anti-vax stance might make the author's decision reasonable. \n\nLegally and ethically, parents have the right to make medical decisions for their children, and vaccines are a public health priority. The author's concern about disease risks versus vaccine complications supports their position. \n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They tried to accommodate but have a right to protect their child's health. The fianc\u00e9e's reaction might be an overreaction given her prior agreement and the author's reasonable compromise. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
