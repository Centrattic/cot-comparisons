Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author and their fianc\u00e9e had a discussion before the engagement about vaccines. They agreed that their kids would be vaccinated, but maybe on an alternative schedule, possibly from another country. The fianc\u00e9e's concern is about \"overloading the baby's body,\" which is a common anti-vaccine sentiment. The author is a healthcare worker, so they're probably pro-vaccine.\n\nNow, after a month of being engaged, the fianc\u00e9e brings up the vaccine issue again, this time being more opposed. She specifically mentions the Hep B vaccine at birth, which the author acknowledges is a bit of a stretch since she has no risk factors. The author sets a limit: the baby can go one month before starting a schedule. The fianc\u00e9e is upset, calling the author manipulative and abusive for the ultimatum. The author mentions they had a prior agreement, but the fianc\u00e9e is now backing out. The author is a healthcare worker, uses data from WHO and CDC, and the fianc\u00e9e is still resistant, even bringing up conspiracy theories about Big Pharma and vaccine effectiveness. The author is now considering ending the relationship if the fianc\u00e9e doesn't agree to the compromise.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key factors here are the prior agreement, the fianc\u00e9e's change of heart, the author's compromise, and the fianc\u00e9e's refusal to budge despite evidence.\n\nThe author tried to find a middle ground with an alternative schedule and a one-month delay. The fianc\u00e9e, however, is now against vaccines in general, which is a significant shift. The author is standing firm on their stance, which is based on their professional experience and data. The fianc\u00e9e's refusal to accept any schedule, even an alternative one, and her emotional response (calling the author abusive) could indicate her stance is not just about the issue but also about the ultimatum.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong for setting a clear boundary? The author had discussed this before the engagement, so there was an expectation set. The fianc\u00e9e agreed then but is now retracting. However, changing one's mind on a serious issue could be valid if new information comes in, but in this case, the fianc\u00e9e's beliefs seem to be based on misinformation. The author is trying to protect the child's health, and vaccines are a critical public health issue. The compromise offered isn't extreme\u2014just a one-month delay and possibly an alternative schedule, which is still within medical guidelines. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9e might feel pressured by the ultimatum, but the author is also at their limit, especially given the fianc\u00e9e's extreme anti-vaccine stance. Since the author is a healthcare worker, their perspective is likely informed by professional knowledge, which adds weight to their position. The fianc\u00e9e's unwillingness to consider any alternative schedule that still involves vaccination is a deal-breaker for the author. \n\nIn relationships, major incompatible values can lead to breaking up. Vaccines might be such a value, especially when it comes to protecting a child's health. The author isn't forcing vaccination but is setting a boundary. The fianc\u00e9e's reaction might be an overreaction or a sign of deeper issues, but the author isn't wrong for prioritizing their values. So, I think the answer is B (Not in the wrong).\n"
