Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong regarding the vaccine ultimatum to his fianc\u00e9e. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The fianc\u00e9e was aware of the author's stance on vaccines before they got engaged. They had discussed alternative schedules, so there was some compromise. Now, after a month of engagement, she's more opposed, especially to the Hep B vaccine. The author, as a healthcare worker, is concerned about risks and gave her an ultimatum: either do a modified schedule within a month or he might break up.\n\nThe key points here are mutual understanding before engagement, the compromise, and the current ultimatum. The author's position is that he stood by his original stance, which was agreed upon. The fianc\u00e9e is now backtracking, which he's unwilling to accept. The user thinks the author is wrong, but I need to consider both sides.\n\nIs the author right to give an ultimatum? Well, he made his position clear from the start. If she didn't agree, maybe she should have reconsidered the relationship. However, the ultimatum is about their future children, which is a significant decision. But the author had already compromised by allowing an alternative schedule. Now he's setting a firm line, which some might see as controlling, but others might see as standing up for his values.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9e changed her stance. If she knew his position before, she might be at fault for not being consistent. However, the author's ultimatum could be seen as pressure, especially since she's not convinced by evidence. The debate here is about respecting each other's beliefs and the right to make medical decisions for future children.\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong because he made his stance clear, and they had a prior agreement. The fianc\u00e9e changed her mind later, which complicates things, but the initial compromise was there. The author's ultimatum is within his right if it's part of his non-negotiables. So, answer B (No).\n"
