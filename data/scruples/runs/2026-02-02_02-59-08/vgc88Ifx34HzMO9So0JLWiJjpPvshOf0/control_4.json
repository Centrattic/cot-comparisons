Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the fianc\u00e9) is in the wrong for giving an ultimatum about vaccines to his fianc\u00e9e. \n\nFirst, the context: The fianc\u00e9 knew she was unvaccinated before proposing. They discussed alternative schedules, like maybe a different country's plan. They agreed the kids would be vaccinated, but now the fianc\u00e9e is more opposed, especially to the Hep B vaccine at birth. The author, a healthcare worker, is concerned about risks and wants a delayed schedule, but no more than a month delay. He gave an ultimatum, leading her to accuse him of being manipulative or abusive. He's asking if he's in the wrong (AITA).\n\nNow, to evaluate. The key points are consent in a relationship, respecting each other's values, and the specific ultimatum. The author had previously discussed vaccines with her and she agreed to work towards vaccination. Now, she's changed her stance. The author is giving an ultimatum because his stance is non-negotiable. \n\nIn relationships, major life decisions like vaccinations are significant. Both partners should ideally agree on such matters. The author considered her views and offered a compromise (delayed schedule), but she's unwilling to budge. The ultimatum is based on his own conviction and his professional background. However, giving an ultimatum can be seen as controlling if it's not a mutual decision. \n\nOn one hand, the author has a valid concern for the child's health and is sticking to his principles. On the other, making the decision unilaterally might not respect her autonomy. But since they had discussed it before and she agreed, maybe the ultimatum is justified. However, some might argue that the way he presented it as a take-it-or-leave-it could be problematic.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9e's accusations of manipulation or abuse depend on the dynamics. If the author is using emotional pressure without considering her reasons, that's an issue. But if he's standing by a decision that's in the child's best interest, others might side with him.\n\nThe answer hinges on whether the ultimatum was a reasonable step after prior agreement. Since he gave some flexibility (delay) and she's not budging, maybe he's not in the wrong. But if the ultimatum was too harsh without mutual discussion, then yes. However, the prior agreement might mitigate that. \n\nLooking at similar AITA cases, people often find the person in the right if they're upholding a previously discussed agreement and have given some flexibility. The fianc\u00e9e changed her stance, and the author is enforcing the prior agreement. So the answer is likely B (not in the wrong).\n"
