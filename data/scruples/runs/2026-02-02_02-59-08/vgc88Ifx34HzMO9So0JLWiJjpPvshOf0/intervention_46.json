Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit post (AITA) is in the wrong for giving an ultimatum about vaccines to his fianc\u00e9e. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The fianc\u00e9e is unvaccinated and against vaccines. The author knew about this before proposing and they had discussed a compromise, maybe an alternative schedule. Now, after a month of engagement, she's more opposed, especially to the Hep B vaccine at birth. The author, a healthcare worker, is concerned about risks and sets an ultimatum: if she doesn't agree to a modified schedule (starting one month later), he can't continue the relationship. She's upset, calling it manipulative and abusive, even though they had previously agreed on vaccinating the kids.\n\nThe author is a healthcare worker, which might influence his stance. He's using data from WHO and CDC to argue, but she's not convinced. She thinks vaccines are a hoax, part of a big pharma conspiracy, and they don't work. He's willing to walk away if she doesn't accept his terms.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. On one hand, he's standing by his convictions about vaccines, which he's researched and believes are safe and necessary. He tried to find a middle ground (alternative schedule) but now she's more resistant. On the other hand, giving an ultimatum can be seen as a strong move, but it's also about a fundamental disagreement that affects their future children. He's not forcing her; he's saying he can't compromise further and needs her to accept his terms.\n\nBut is it manipulative or abusive? He says he told her from the start that he wouldn't change his stance on vaccines. She agreed then, but now she's not. He's trying to set a boundary. However, ultimatums in relationships can be contentious, especially when it comes to personal beliefs. But given that the issue is about parenting decisions, which are critical for the child's health, maybe his stance is justified.\n\nThe key points: He tried to find a compromise, she's not budging despite evidence, and the issue is non-negotiable for him. She might feel pressured, but he's not forcing her, just making his position clear. It's a tough balance between respecting her autonomy and protecting the child's health. \n\nI think it's a complex situation. But since he's being clear about his boundaries and she's unwilling to meet the terms he set, maybe he's not in the wrong. However, some might argue that pushing for vaccines in this way could be seen as controlling. But given the context of parenting and health, I'm leaning towards B (No, he's not in the wrong).\n"
