Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for giving an ultimatum over vaccines to their fianc\u00e9e. The scenario is that the author knew the fianc\u00e9e was unvaccinated before proposing and had discussed alternative schedules. Now, after a month of engagement, the fianc\u00e9e is more opposed to vaccines, especially the Hep B vaccine at birth. The author, a healthcare worker, is firm on vaccination and gives an ultimatum that the baby must start vaccines within a month, offering a modified schedule. The fianc\u00e9e is upset, calling it manipulative and abusive, leading the author to question if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has clear values about vaccinating their children and has made that clear from the start. They proposed an alternative schedule as a compromise, allowing some flexibility but with a firm deadline. The fianc\u00e9e, on the other hand, has changed her stance, becoming more anti-vax despite evidence provided. The author is a healthcare worker, so their concern about disease risks might be more informed by their profession.\n\nNow, is the author right to give an ultimatum? Some might argue that giving an ultimatum is controlling, especially in a relationship. However, others might say that when it's about the health of a child, it's a valid stance. The author tried to find a middle ground with an alternative schedule, which shows some compromise. The fianc\u00e9e's refusal to budge despite evidence could be a problem. The author isn't forcing the vaccines but setting a boundary. The key is whether the ultimatum is unreasonable. Since the author allowed for a modified schedule and a one-month delay, it's not entirely rigid. However, the ultimatum is based on the author's strong convictions, which the fianc\u00e9e didn't agree with, leading to conflict.\n\nAnother angle: in relationships, major decisions like vaccination require mutual agreement. If the author knew the fianc\u00e9e's stance beforehand and still proposed, maybe they should have prepared for this conflict. But they did discuss it before, so they might have thought it was settled. The fianc\u00e9e's change of heart could be the main issue here. Also, the author's job as a healthcare worker might influence their perspective on risk versus benefit.\n\nIs the ultimatum abusive? The fianc\u00e9e feels manipulated, but the author is stating their non-negotiable line. It's a tough spot where personal values clash. Depending on cultural or societal norms, some might side with the author for prioritizing public health, while others might see it as imposing personal beliefs. The author isn't forcing the vaccines but setting a deadline, which could be seen as reasonable if the fianc\u00e9e was aware of the stance beforehand.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's actions are based on their values and profession, and they tried to find a compromise. The fianc\u00e9e's refusal to accept any vaccination could be the issue here. Whether the author is in the wrong depends on whether setting such a firm boundary is acceptable in the context of their prior agreement. Since they discussed it before engagement and the author allowed some flexibility, the answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong. However, the ultimatum could be seen as harsh. But given the health implications, it's a complex situation. I think the answer is B (author not in the wrong).\n"
