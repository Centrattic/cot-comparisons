Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author (the fianc\u00e9e) is in the wrong for giving an ultimatum about vaccines. Wait, no, wait\u2014the original post is from the fianc\u00e9 who's asking if he's in the wrong (AITA: Am I the Asshole?), but the user's question is phrased as \"Is the person who wrote this in the wrong...\" So the person in the story is the one giving the ultimatum, and the user is asking if that person (the author of the Reddit post) is in the wrong. The options are A for yes, B for no.\n\nFirst, let's understand the situation. The fianc\u00e9 knew his fianc\u00e9e was unvaccinated before proposing. They discussed alternative schedules, maybe following another country's schedule. He was okay with an alternative but wanted the kids vaccinated eventually. Now, after a month of being engaged, she's reiterating her opposition, especially to the Hep B vaccine at birth. He's a healthcare worker, concerned about the risk of her coming into contact with the disease (though she has no medical history of being exposed). He's given her an ultimatum: either the baby starts the vaccination schedule within a month or follow an alternative. She's upset, calling him manipulative, and he's asking if he's the asshole.\n\nNow, the key points here. Vaccines are a personal choice, but when it comes to children, the parents have joint responsibility. The author is setting a boundary based on his beliefs and job. He's given her a compromise (alternative schedule with a delay) but she's not accepting it. She initially agreed to work towards the vaccination but now says she's against it. He's standing his ground and is ready to walk away if she doesn't agree. \n\nIs he in the wrong? Well, from a public health perspective, vaccines are generally safe and effective, and delaying or skipping them increases disease risk. However, in the US, vaccine exemptions (medical, religious, philosophical) do exist. The author is trying to find a middle ground. However, the Hep B vaccine at birth is recommended because it's effective when given early, especially for preventing mother-to-child transmission. But in this case, the mother isn't a carrier, so the immediate risk is lower. Still, the author is concerned about other exposure routes.\n\nThe author's ultimatum is a deal-breaker. The fianc\u00e9e is now not okay with that. The question is whether he's in the wrong for making that decision. Some might say he's standing up for his values and protecting the child's health. Others might think he's being controlling, especially if the fianc\u00e9e genuinely believes in her stance. But since the fianc\u00e9e was aware of his position from the start and agreed to work towards it, maybe his ultimatum is reasonable. However, if she changed her mind, maybe he's not respecting her autonomy. But the child's health is a shared responsibility. \n\nAnother angle: the fianc\u00e9e's views are based on conspiracy theories (big pharma, vaccines don't work), which he's tried to counter with data but she refuses to budge. He's presented a compromise, but she's not accepting. If he's willing to walk away rather than have unvaccinated children, is that his right? In terms of parental rights, both parents have the right to make decisions for their children, and if they can't agree, one might have to walk away. But it's a tough situation. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author is making a decision based on his values and the health of the child. He's given a compromise, but the fianc\u00e9e isn't willing to accept it. Since they can't reach an agreement, perhaps he's within his rights to set that boundary, especially since he was transparent from the beginning. Therefore, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
