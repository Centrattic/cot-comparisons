Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about vaccines and whether giving an ultimatum is justified.\n\nFirst, the author knew their fianc\u00e9e was unvaccinated before proposing. They discussed alternative schedules and agreed on some plan. But after being engaged a month, she's more opposed now, especially to the Hep B vaccine at birth. The author is a healthcare worker, so they're concerned about risk. They gave her an ultimatum: either follow the modified schedule (starting one month later) or the author would walk away.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9e is accusing the author of being manipulative and abusive. The author had previously stated their stance on vaccines early in the relationship. The fianc\u00e9e initially agreed to work towards it but now is against it, despite evidence provided.\n\nSo, the key points are: Both had an agreement initially. The author gave a compromise (delayed schedule). The fianc\u00e9e changed her mind and is refusing. The author is standing firm, leading to the ultimatum. The question is whether the author is wrong for this.\n\nFrom a perspective of personal boundaries: The author has a strong stance on vaccines, which is their right. If both cannot agree on a plan they can live with, then the ultimatum could be seen as the author protecting their values. But forcing someone to make a medical decision for a child might be seen as overstepping, especially if the child is a dependent. However, in many cultures, parents have the right to make healthcare decisions for their children. The author is a healthcare worker, which adds credibility to their stance.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9e's change in position might be due to misinformation. The author tried to provide evidence, but she's still not convinced. In that case, the author is trying to protect the child's health based on their professional knowledge. However, making a relationship ultimatum can be seen as extreme. But if both partners can't align on such a critical issue for their child's future, it's a valid reason to end the relationship.\n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They tried to find a middle ground, and when that failed, they set a boundary. The fianc\u00e9e's refusal to accept even a modified schedule might be the issue. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
