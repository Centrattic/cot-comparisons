Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe user is a fianc\u00e9 who knew their partner was unvaccinated before proposing. They had previously discussed alternative vaccination schedules, maybe even one from another country, to accommodate the fianc\u00e9e's concerns about \"overloading the baby\u2019s body.\" They agreed that the kids would be vaccinated but under some modified schedule. Now, after a month of engagement, the fianc\u00e9e is bringing up her opposition again, especially against the Hep B vaccine given at birth. The user, as a healthcare worker, is concerned about the risk of transmitting diseases, even though they acknowledge the possibility is low. The user's stance is that the baby can wait a month before starting any alternative schedule, but the fianc\u00e9e is upset, calling the ultimatum manipulative and abusive. The user is confused because they had already made their position clear early in the relationship about vaccinating the children, and the fianc\u00e9e agreed to work towards it. Now, after presenting a compromise (one month delay), she's more resistant than ever, citing conspiracy theories and misinformation. The user is asking if they're the a**hole for walking away if she doesn't accept the ultimatum.\n\nFirst, I should consider the context. The user is a healthcare worker, which probably means they have a professional understanding of vaccines and their importance. The fianc\u00e9e has a history of anti-vaccine beliefs, including thinking it's a big pharma ploy and that vaccines don't work. The user tried to find a middle ground by agreeing to an alternative schedule but now is drawing a hard line at one month. The fianc\u00e9e, on the other hand, feels pressured and is upset about the ultimatum.\n\nThe key issue here is the ultimatum. The user is essentially saying that if the fianc\u00e9e can't agree to at least some delayed but valid vaccination plan, he's willing to end the relationship. Is that fair? Well, vaccines are a critical public health issue, and not vaccinating can put not just the child at risk but others around them, especially in the case of contagious diseases. The user is concerned about that risk, which is valid. However, giving an ultimatum in a relationship is a big deal. Even if the topic is important, the way it's handled matters. \n\nBut the user did mention that they had already discussed this before and reached an agreement. Now the fianc\u00e9e is backtracking. She's being inconsistent, and the user is trying to set boundaries. The user isn't asking for the full schedule upfront but is allowing a one-month delay, which seems like a reasonable compromise. However, the fianc\u00e9e is now doubling down on her anti-vax stance, which the user has evidence against. \n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9e's reaction to being called manipulative and abusive raises the question of whether the ultimatum is too harsh. Relationships involve compromise, but when it comes to the health and safety of a child, it's understandable that someone would be firm. The user is trying to protect the child from preventable diseases, which is a responsible stance. \n\nI should also think about the concept of ultimatums. They can be seen as controlling if not handled carefully. But in this case, the user is setting a clear boundary based on pre-existing discussions and their own values. The fianc\u00e9e's initial agreement and subsequent change might be part of the problem. \n\nAnother angle: the user is using the word \"ultimatum,\" which is a take-it-or-leave-it proposition. Some might argue that in a relationship, especially when planning a family, such a decision is too critical to leave to an ultimatum. But given the fianc\u00e9e's refusal to consider any scientific evidence and her conspiracy theories, the user might feel that there's no middle ground left. \n\nSo, is the user in the wrong? If the fianc\u00e9e had changed her position without any valid new reasons, the user is within their right to set boundaries. However, if the user is using the ultimatum as a manipulative tactic, that's a problem. But the user is a healthcare worker and has a professional responsibility to consider safety. The Hep B vaccine at birth is recommended because the risk of contracting it is higher if delayed, but the user is allowing a month. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9e's opposition seems to be based on misinformation and ideology, not on evidence or medical advice. The user has tried to provide data and counter her arguments but she's not swayed. In that case, the user might be justified in their stance. \n\nBut relationships are about mutual respect. Even if the user has a valid health concern, the way they're enforcing it could be seen as overbearing. However, the user is trying to find a compromise, so maybe it's not entirely their fault. \n\nI think the answer depends on whether the user's ultimatum is reasonable given the circumstances. Since they had prior agreement and the fianc\u00e9e is now refusing, and the user is a healthcare professional, the user's position might be more defensible. However, the use of an ultimatum could still be contentious. But in this case, the fianc\u00e9e's refusal to budge despite evidence might mean the user isn't at fault. \n\nSo I'm leaning towards B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The user is standing by their values and a compromise they had already discussed, and the fianc\u00e9e is not cooperating. The user's concern is legitimate, and they are trying to protect the child's health. The ultimatum here is a firm boundary, which could be necessary when the other person is unwilling to compromise.\n"
