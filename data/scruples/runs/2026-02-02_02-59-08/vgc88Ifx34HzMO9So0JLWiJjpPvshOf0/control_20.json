Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user wants to know if the author (the person in the \"AITA\" post) is in the wrong for giving an ultimatum about vaccines to his fianc\u00e9e. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The fianc\u00e9e is unvaccinated, and they had previously discussed alternative schedules. The author proposed an alternative schedule, but after a month, the fianc\u00e9e became more opposed, especially to the Hep B vaccine at birth. The author, as a healthcare worker, is concerned about risks and set a limit: the baby can't start vaccinations until one month of age. The fianc\u00e9e now accuses him of being manipulative and abusive. The author is considering walking away if she doesn't agree.\n\nSo, the key points: Both agreed on vaccinations but with alternative schedules. The fianc\u00e9e later changed her stance, denying the necessity of Hep B. The author tried to compromise but now faces a breakdown in the relationship.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The fianc\u00e9e's change of heart might be a factor. Did the author give her enough time to adjust? The original agreement was about alternative schedules, but now she's against vaccines entirely. The author is standing by his position, which is reasonable for a healthcare worker. However, giving an ultimatum can be seen as extreme. But considering the importance of health decisions for children, maybe it's justified. \n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9e's refusal to budge despite evidence suggests she's unwilling to compromise. The author tried to find middle ground (delaying by a month), but she's not accepting it. The author's stance is based on factual data and professional experience. \n\nIs there cultural context? Vaccines are a sensitive topic. The author tried to provide evidence, but she's entrenched in anti-vax beliefs. The ultimatum is a last resort when compromise isn't possible. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, both might share some. The fianc\u00e9e changed her position, but the author's ultimatum could be seen as the final straw. However, given the critical nature of child healthcare decisions, the author's position might be defensible. \n\nI think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because he tried to compromise and is standing firm on a critical health issue, especially being a healthcare worker. The fianc\u00e9e's refusal to accept any compromise after changing her stance might mean the problem isn't entirely on the author.\n"
