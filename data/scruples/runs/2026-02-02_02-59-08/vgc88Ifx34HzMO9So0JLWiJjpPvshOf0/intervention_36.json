Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author (the person who posted the story) is in the wrong for giving an ultimatum about vaccines to their fianc\u00e9e.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The fianc\u00e9e is unvaccinated and against vaccines, especially the Hep B vaccine at birth. The author is a healthcare worker and wants their children to be vaccinated. They had discussed this before getting engaged, and the fianc\u00e9e agreed to follow some schedule, maybe a modified one. Now, after a month of engagement, the fianc\u00e9e is more opposed and the author gives an ultimatum: either agree to a delayed schedule (one month wait) or the author will walk away. The fianc\u00e9e is upset, calling it manipulative and abusive.\n\nThe author is asking if they're in the wrong. The user says they think the author is in the wrong but wants to know my take.\n\nHmm. Let's break it down. The key points are consent, communication, and ultimatums in relationships. The author and fianc\u00e9e had prior discussions about this. The author is clear about his stance from the start, and she initially agreed to work towards it. Now she's changed her mind. The author gives a specific compromise (one month delay), which the fianc\u00e9e rejects, leading to the ultimatum.\n\nIs giving an ultimatum about such a significant decision (child's health) a form of manipulation or abuse? The fianc\u00e9e feels that way, but the author sees it as standing by their principles. \n\nIn relationships, both parties should work on issues together. If one person is non-negotiable on a major issue and the other is willing to walk away, it's about values and boundaries. The author's argument is about protecting the child's health and following medical advice. The fianc\u00e9e's refusal, despite evidence, shows a firm stance. \n\nCould the author have handled it differently? Maybe. Perhaps more dialogue or seeking counseling. But the author has tried presenting data, she's not budging. So, is the author in the wrong for walking away? It's a tough call. On one hand, ultimatums can be controlling. On the other, the author is standing firm on a core value. \n\nThe author's compromise (one month delay) is a concession, but the fianc\u00e9e isn't accepting. The author's stance is that they can't compromise further. If both can't meet in the middle, breaking up might be necessary. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because they tried to find a middle ground and communicated their stance early. The fianc\u00e9e's refusal to budge despite prior agreement could be the issue. So, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
