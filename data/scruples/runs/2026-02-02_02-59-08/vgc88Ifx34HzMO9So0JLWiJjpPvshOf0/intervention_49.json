Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a couple where the fianc\u00e9 is unvaccinated and the author wants their kids to be vaccinated. They had discussed alternative schedules before, but now the fianc\u00e9 is against vaccines entirely, especially the Hep B vaccine at birth. The author gives an ultimatum: either they follow a modified schedule starting after one month or the author walks away. The fianc\u00e9 is upset, calling the ultimatum manipulative and abusive. The question is whether the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B).\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is a healthcare worker, so they likely have a strong understanding of vaccine safety and importance. They mention that they discussed alternative schedules before, but now the fianc\u00e9's stance has hardened. The author isn't forcing full vaccination but is offering a slightly delayed schedule as the maximum compromise. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9's refusal to vaccinate is based on distrust of big pharma and misinformation, despite being shown data. The author's ultimatum is a way to stay true to their values regarding their children's health.\n\nBut is giving an ultimatum about a child's healthcare a reasonable action? It's a big decision that affects the future of the family. Some might argue that the author is prioritizing their beliefs over the possibility of the relationship continuing, which could be seen as selfish. Others might say that the author is justified in protecting their children's health, especially since the fianc\u00e9 is unwilling to compromise despite prior agreements.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9's reaction of calling it manipulative and abusive is a red flag. Ultimatums in relationships can be harmful, even if the subject is important. The author might be justified in their stance but the method of handling it\u2014giving an ultimatum\u2014could be problematic. Relationships require mutual respect and negotiation, and an ultimatum might not allow for that. However, when it comes to a child's health, especially when one parent is firmly against vaccination and refuses to budge, the other parent might feel they have no choice but to take a firm stance.\n\nI also need to think about societal norms and what's considered acceptable. In some communities, vaccine hesitancy is more accepted, but in others, vaccination is the norm. The author's profession as a healthcare worker adds weight to their perspective, but personal beliefs can be strong. The key here is whether the author's actions are considered excessive or reasonable. Giving a one-month window for a modified schedule isn't entirely refusing vaccination, which is a middle ground. The fianc\u00e9's unwillingness to accept even that could be seen as inflexible.\n\nUltimately, this is a tough spot. The author is trying to protect their children's health, which is a parent's duty, but the method of handling it might be seen as too rigid. However, if the fianc\u00e9 was aware of the author's stance before engagement and agreed, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. The question is whether the ultimatum crosses a line. I think it's a judgment call. If the author had tried more to find a middle ground or seek counseling, maybe. But given the circumstances, the author might be seen as justified in their decision, even if the approach is contentious. So, I'm leaning towards B (the author is not in the wrong), but it's close.\n"
