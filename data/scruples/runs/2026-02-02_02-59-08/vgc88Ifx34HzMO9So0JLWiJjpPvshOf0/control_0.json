Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's start by understanding the situation. The author is engaged to someone who is against vaccines. They had previously discussed an alternative schedule but now the fianc\u00e9e is more opposed, especially to the Hep B vaccine at birth. The author, being a healthcare worker, is concerned about the risks and has set a limit of waiting one month before starting vaccinations. The fianc\u00e9e feels this is manipulative and abusive, and the author is wondering if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has a clear stance on vaccines and set boundaries for their children. They mentioned they're in healthcare, which likely gives them more exposure to medical information. The fianc\u00e9e, on the other hand, has changed her position, which could create conflict. The author's ultimatum is based on their prior agreement and their professional background.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key points are: prior discussion of alternative schedules, the fianc\u00e9e's current strong opposition, and the author's ultimatum. The author isn't forcing traditional schedules but allowing a delayed start. The fianc\u00e9e's refusal to compromise might be a bigger issue. However, giving an ultimatum in a relationship is a serious step. The author's actions stem from their commitment to vaccination and concern for the child's health. But is setting a firm boundary wrong? \n\nIn relationships, respecting each other's values is crucial. The author's stance is based on health concerns, which are legitimate. However, the ultimatum might be seen as inflexible. The fianc\u00e9e's change in position and refusal to budge could also contribute to the conflict. The author's decision to walk away if the fianc\u00e9e doesn't agree isn't inherently wrong if they feel it's a non-negotiable part of their values. However, it's important to consider communication and whether all efforts were made to find a middle ground. \n\nThe author has tried providing data and discussing the issue, which shows they're trying to reason. The fianc\u00e9e's conspiracy theories and refusal to accept evidence might make compromise difficult. The author's limit of one month seems reasonable given their medical background. The question is whether this is a valid boundary or if it's too rigid. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, both parties have their own values. The author isn't forcing traditional schedules but is setting a boundary. If the fianc\u00e9e can't accept that, it's a matter of mutual respect. The author isn't in the wrong for standing by their convictions, especially regarding their child's health. However, the way the ultimatum was presented and the emotional response from the fianc\u00e9e might indicate a need for more discussion. But the author's actions don't seem malicious; they\u2019re protecting their values. So, the answer would likely be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
