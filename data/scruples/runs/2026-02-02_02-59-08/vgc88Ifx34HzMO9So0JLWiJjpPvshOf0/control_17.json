Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again to make sure I understand all the details. \n\nThe author is engaged to someone who is unvaccinated. They had previously discussed alternative vaccination schedules, maybe even from another country, to accommodate the fianc\u00e9e's concerns about \"overloading the baby's body.\" They agreed that the kids would be vaccinated under some schedule. Now, after a month of engagement, the fianc\u00e9e is bringing up her opposition again, especially against the Hep B vaccine at birth. The author is a healthcare worker concerned about the risk of transmitting Hep B to the baby, even though the fianc\u00e9e has no medical history that would put the baby at risk. \n\nThe author sets an ultimatum: the baby can start an alternative schedule no later than one month old. The fianc\u00e9e is now upset, calling the author manipulative and abusive. The author mentions they had already discussed this before entering the relationship, and the fianc\u00e9e agreed. Now she's changing her stance, and despite the author showing data from WHO and CDC, she's still against vaccines, citing Big Pharma conspiracies and vaccine ineffectiveness. The author is considering walking away if she doesn't accept the compromise. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nFirst, let's consider the author's perspective. They made a compromise by allowing an alternative schedule but set a limit. They are a healthcare professional, so they have expertise in this area. They made their stance clear from the start, and the fianc\u00e9e had agreed. The author's actions are based on wanting to ensure the child's health and safety, which is a valid concern for any parent. \n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9e is now refusing to budge, even after the compromise. The author is giving her a choice, which could be seen as an ultimatum. But given the importance of vaccinations, especially for a child's health, the author is trying to find a middle ground. The fianc\u00e9e's refusal to accept even a modified schedule might be seen as putting her beliefs above the child's well-being. \n\nHowever, the author is giving her an option to choose an alternative schedule within a timeframe, which is not completely refusing vaccines. The Hep B vaccine at birth is a common practice, especially for preventing mother-to-child transmission. Since the fianc\u00e9e has no risk factors, maybe the author's stance is reasonable. The author is not being rigid but allowing some flexibility. \n\nIs giving an ultimatum inherently wrong? It depends on the circumstances. If the author is willing to walk away because they can't compromise further, but still allows for an alternative schedule, it's a tough call. The fianc\u00e9e's change of heart after agreeing earlier might indicate inconsistency on her part. \n\nThe author hasn't forced the issue; they're presenting a compromise. The fianc\u00e9e's response of calling it manipulative could stem from her opposition rather than the author's actions. The author's actions are based on prior agreement and their professional background. \n\nConsidering that the author is trying to balance both their views and is open to an alternative schedule, but has a limit, it's a reasonable approach. The fianc\u00e9e's refusal to accept any vaccination schedule might make the author's stance the correct one. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
