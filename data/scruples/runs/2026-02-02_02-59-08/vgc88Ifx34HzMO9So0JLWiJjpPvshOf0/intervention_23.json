Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for giving an ultimatum regarding vaccines to their fianc\u00e9e. The scenario is that the author knew the fianc\u00e9e was unvaccinated before proposing and had discussed alternative schedules. They agreed that the kids would be vaccinated. Now, the fianc\u00e9e is against vaccines more strongly, especially the Hep B vaccine at birth. The author, a healthcare worker, is concerned about risks and has set an ultimatum: the baby can be unvaccinated for one month before starting an alternative schedule. The fianc\u00e9e is upset, calling the author manipulative and abusive for the ultimatum, and the author is questioning if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and moral aspects here. The author has clear personal beliefs about vaccination, which they've held for a long time and communicated early in the relationship. They even proposed a compromise with an alternative schedule. The fianc\u00e9e, however, has shifted her stance, becoming more anti-vaccine and distrustful of the medical system. The author, after trying to reason with her using data and evidence, has set a firm boundary, which the fianc\u00e9e is now reacting strongly to.\n\nIs the author justified in setting this ultimatum? The author is prioritizing their values and the health of their future children. They're not forcing the fianc\u00e9e to accept all vaccines but are offering a compromise. However, the ultimatum aspect\u2014saying they can take it or leave it\u2014might be seen as too rigid. In a relationship, especially one as committed as an engagement, ultimatums can be destructive. The fianc\u00e9e might feel cornered, especially if she's not ready to change her views despite the evidence presented. The author could be seen as being inflexible, not allowing room for dialogue or compromise. On the flip side, the author is standing up for what they believe is right for their children's health.\n\nAnother angle is the communication aspect. The author states they told the fianc\u00e9e early on about their stance on vaccines. The fianc\u00e9e agreed to work towards it, but now the author is giving an ultimatum, which might be a step too far. Even if the author's intentions are good, the method of presenting the ultimatum could be perceived as manipulative or controlling, especially if the fianc\u00e9e feels coerced into a decision. The fact that the author is a healthcare worker adds weight to their concerns about public health, but personal beliefs must be balanced with respecting a partner's autonomy.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9e's reaction might be partly due to feeling that her autonomy is being undermined. If she genuinely believes vaccines are harmful and the author is insisting despite her convictions, it's a clash of deeply held beliefs. The author might be in the right in terms of their own values, but the way they're enforcing it could be the issue. The question is whether setting a strict boundary is a fair negotiation in a relationship. Sometimes, relationships require both parties to meet in the middle, and an ultimatum can break that balance.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's concern for the children's health is understandable, the use of an ultimatum might be seen as inconsiderate of the fianc\u00e9e's perspectives and could be viewed as a form of control. The author might not be entirely in the wrong, but their approach could be problematic. However, the answer hinges on whether an ultimatum is a reasonable way to resolve such a significant disagreement in a committed relationship.\n"
