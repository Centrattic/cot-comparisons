Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for giving an ultimatum about vaccines to his fianc\u00e9e. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author and his fianc\u00e9e had previously discussed vaccination schedules, and he was aware she was unvaccinated before proposing. They agreed that the kids would be vaccinated, but now she's more against it, especially the Hep B vaccine at birth. He offers a one-month delay before starting an alternative schedule, but she's upset and calls him manipulative. He's a healthcare worker and doesn't want the risk of the baby getting sick. He's given her data from WHO and CDC, but she still refuses, thinking vaccines are a big pharma scam. He says he's willing to walk away if she doesn't accept his terms.\n\nNow, to determine if he's in the wrong. On one hand, he's standing by his decision to vaccinate, which is a personal right. He's given her information, and they had prior agreement. He's setting boundaries for their future children's health. On the other hand, ultimatums can be seen as controlling. But given that they're planning a family, and his stance is based on health concerns, maybe it's reasonable. \n\nBut is it manipulative? He's being clear about his limits, which is important in a relationship. If she knew his position from the start and agreed, then he's not changing his stance. However, she's now more opposed than before, which complicates things. The key is whether his ultimatum is reasonable. Since he's made a compromise (one-month delay), it's a middle ground. \n\nConsidering that he's tried to find a middle ground and provided evidence, but she's not budging, maybe he's justified in setting the boundary. The fact that he's a healthcare worker adds to his perspective on risk. The question is about being in the wrong. If both sides have valid points, but he's not forcing her, just stating his limits, then he's not necessarily wrong. So the answer might be B (No).\n"
