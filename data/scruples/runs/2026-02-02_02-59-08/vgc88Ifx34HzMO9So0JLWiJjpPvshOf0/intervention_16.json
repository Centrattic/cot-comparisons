Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author (the fianc\u00e9) is in the wrong for giving an ultimatum about vaccines to their fianc\u00e9e. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The fianc\u00e9 knew their partner was unvaccinated before proposing. They had discussed alternative schedules, maybe from another country, to ease her concerns about overloading the baby. They agreed the kids would be vaccinated. Now, after a month of engagement, she's bringing it up again, being more against vaccines, especially the Hep B vaccine. The fianc\u00e9, a healthcare worker, wants a schedule where the baby gets Hep B at birth, but she refuses. The fianc\u00e9's compromise is a one-month delay before starting an alternative schedule. The fianc\u00e9e is upset, calling it manipulative, and threatening that if she doesn't agree, the author would walk away. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know my opinion.\n\nSo, key points: Both had agreed on vaccines, but the fianc\u00e9e is now more anti-vax. The author gives a compromise but an ultimatum. The fianc\u00e9e feels pressured, leading to the argument.\n\nNow, considering the question of right or wrong. The author is standing their ground on a core value\u2014vaccinating children. They tried to compromise. The fianc\u00e9e changed her stance. The author is giving her a choice. Is this an ultimatum that's too harsh? Or is the author justified in their position?\n\nIn relationships, when one person's non-negotiable issues clash with the other's, it's a tough spot. The author has a valid concern for the child's health. The fianc\u00e9e's change of heart might be a problem. The author tried to find middle ground but has a limit. The fianc\u00e9e accuses him of being manipulative, but he's stating his boundaries. \n\nHowever, the author is using an ultimatum, which is a major decision. Is it fair to end the relationship over this? It's a personal choice. But if the fianc\u00e9e had agreed before and is now backing out, maybe the author is justified in not backing down. On the flip side, maybe the author should have been more patient or found another solution. \n\nThe user thinks the author is wrong, but I'm not sure. The author is clear about their stance and tried to compromise. The fianc\u00e9e's refusal could lead to a break-up, which is tough, but sometimes necessary when core values conflict. So, I think the author isn't in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
