Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for giving an ultimatum about vaccines to their fianc\u00e9e. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The author knew their fianc\u00e9e was unvaccinated before proposing and had discussed alternative schedules. They agreed that the kids would be vaccinated. Now, after a month of engagement, the fianc\u00e9e is more opposed, especially to the Hep B vaccine at birth. The author, a healthcare worker, is concerned about the risk and sets a limit that the baby can wait one month before starting an alternative schedule. The fianc\u00e9e feels manipulated and abusive because of the ultimatum.\n\nThe key points here are consent and communication. The author mentions that they had discussed this before, so there was an agreement. The fianc\u00e9e's current stance seems to have shifted, which the author finds confusing. The author is standing their ground because of their professional background and health concerns. \n\nBut is the ultimatum reasonable? The author is willing to compromise by deferring the first vaccine by a month, which is a middle ground. However, giving an ultimatum can feel coercive, even if based on prior agreements. The fianc\u00e9e's feelings of being manipulated might stem from the pressure to conform to the author's stance without room for negotiation. \n\nAlso, the fianc\u00e9e's beliefs about vaccines being a hoax are deeply rooted, and the author's attempts to provide data haven't changed her mind. In such cases, forcing a decision might not be the best approach. While the author's stance is based on health facts, imposing a choice without mutual agreement could strain the relationship. \n\nHowever, the author is clear about their non-negotiable line regarding their children's health. It's a personal choice with significant health implications, so they might feel justified in not backing down. That said, the way the ultimatum was presented might have been harsh, contributing to the conflict. \n\nConsidering all aspects, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for setting boundaries based on their values and professional knowledge. But the method of presenting the ultimatum could have been more collaborative. Ultimately, it's a situation where both parties need to respect each other's values, and if that's not possible, the author's choice to walk away might be their only option.\n"
