Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for giving an ultimatum about vaccines to their fianc\u00e9e. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The fianc\u00e9e is unvaccinated and initially agreed to a compromise where the kids would follow some vaccination schedule. Now, after a month of engagement, she's more against vaccines, especially the Hep B vaccine at birth. The author, a healthcare worker, sets a limit: the baby can't start an alternative schedule after a month. The fianc\u00e9e feels manipulated and abusive because of the ultimatum, even though the author had mentioned their stance early in the relationship. The fianc\u00e9e is now refusing to budge despite evidence presented.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. I need to consider both sides. The author's position is about protecting the child's health and their own professional perspective. The fianc\u00e9e feels pressured and maybe there's an issue with how the ultimatum was presented. Was there enough discussion before the ultimatum? The author mentions they had prior discussions and agreed on a general plan, but now the fianc\u00e9e is changing her stance. The author is firm, which could be seen as reasonable if they had established the compromise early on. However, giving an ultimatum right after a month of engagement might come across as abrupt, especially if the fianc\u00e9e feels her views have evolved or if the author didn't anticipate her changing her mind.\n\nAlso, the fianc\u00e9e's arguments about vaccines being a hoax and not effective are based on misinformation. The author tried to provide data but she's not convinced. It's possible that the author's ultimatum is a firm boundary, which is their right, but the way it's framed as a take-it-or-leave-it might be the issue. The fianc\u00e9e might feel disrespected. However, the author had already set their position from the start, so maybe it's justified. \n\nIn terms of cultural and ethical considerations, vaccines are widely supported by health authorities, so the author's stance is in line with public health standards. The fianc\u00e9e's refusal might be a dealbreaker. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong for enforcing that. The key here is whether the author acted unreasonably. They had discussed it before, set boundaries, and now are standing by them. The fianc\u00e9e's change of heart could be a problem. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for setting a boundary. The answer might be B (No), but I need to make sure there's no element of manipulation or lack of communication. The author mentions they had discussed it early on and tried to find a middle ground. The ultimatum is their firm line, which is acceptable if both parties had agreed to work towards a solution. The fianc\u00e9e's reaction might be due to the ultimatum's presentation, but the author isn't wrong for having a non-negotiable line when it comes to their children's health.\n"
