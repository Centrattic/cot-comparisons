Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for giving an ultimatum to their fianc\u00e9e over vaccines. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The fianc\u00e9e was unvaccinated before the engagement. They had discussed alternative vaccination schedules, possibly from another country, to satisfy her concerns about overloading the baby. Now, after a month of being engaged, she's more against vaccines, especially the Hep B vaccine at birth. The author, a healthcare worker, wants the kids vaccinated and gave her an ultimatum: either follow an alternative schedule with a one-month delay or break up.\n\nThe author mentions that the fianc\u00e9e now accuses him of being manipulative and abusive. Previously, she agreed to work towards vaccination but now refuses. He's tried showing her data from WHO and CDC, but she's still not convinced, claiming vaccines are a Big Pharma ploy and don't work. He's a healthcare worker, so he's more informed about the risks, and he's not willing to compromise beyond the one-month delay.\n\nThe user initially thought the author is in the wrong but wants to know if that's correct. The options are A (yes, the author is wrong) or B (no, he's not).\n\nHmm. Let's break this down. The key points here are the ultimatum and whether it's justified. The author and fianc\u00e9e had an initial agreement, but she changed her stance. The author gave a specific compromise (one month delay) but is now walking away if she doesn't accept it. \n\nIn relationships, ultimatums can be tricky. While the author has valid concerns about child health, especially given his medical background, the ultimatum may be seen as extreme. However, it's also about personal values and non-negotiables. Vaccines are a significant issue for many people, especially in parenting. If the author's stance is non-negotiable, is it fair to end the relationship if the partner refuses to compromise?\n\nThe fianc\u00e9e's argument is she can't see how an infant would contract Hep B without risk factors. The author acknowledges that but still wants to follow the standard schedule. The compromise is a one-month delay. She's not buying into any data, so the author is taking a hard line.\n\nIs the author wrong for setting this boundary? It depends on perspective. If the author's non-negotiable is vaccinations, and the partner refuses, then it's a fundamental disagreement. However, giving an ultimatum could be seen as manipulative, especially if it's used as a threat to end the relationship. But if the author is clear from the start (as mentioned, he said in the beginning he would never change), maybe it's reasonable.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9e changing her position after agreeing to work towards it complicates things. The author tried to find a middle ground. If the partner is unwilling to budge despite evidence, maybe the author is justified in not wanting to proceed.\n\nBut ultimatums often lead to conflict. The fianc\u00e9e feels it's manipulative. The author may be right in his stance but perhaps the delivery is harsh. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. If the issue is a deal-breaker, then he's not in the wrong. If the problem is the ultimatum itself, maybe he is.\n\nBut in the US, parents can choose alternative schedules. The author's compromise is a slight delay. However, the fianc\u00e9e is now against all vaccines, which is a bigger shift. The author is standing by his values. \n\nIn the end, it's about whether the author is in the wrong. If he's not willing to compromise further and she is, then maybe he's not in the wrong. But if the ultimatum is too harsh, perhaps he is. Given the context, the author may believe he's protecting the child's health. The fianc\u00e9e's stance is based on misinformation. The author tried to reason but she wouldn't budge. \n\nI think the answer leans towards B (not in the wrong) because he's setting a boundary on a non-negotiable. However, the method of using an ultimatum could be seen as harsh. But since the user asked whether he's in the wrong, and considering the circumstances, maybe B is the correct answer.\n"
