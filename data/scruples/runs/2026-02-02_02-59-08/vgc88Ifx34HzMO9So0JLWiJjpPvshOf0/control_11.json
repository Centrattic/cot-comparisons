Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for giving an ultimatum about vaccines to his fianc\u00e9e. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The fianc\u00e9e is unvaccinated and initially agreed to a modified schedule. Now, after being engaged a month, she's more against vaccines, especially the Hep B vaccine at birth. The author, a healthcare worker, is concerned about disease risks and is clear that he won't compromise beyond a one-month delay. He's given her an ultimatum, and she's now accusing him of being manipulative and abusive. \n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). The key points here are consent, communication, and respect. The fianc\u00e9e initially agreed to vaccinate the kids but is now changing her stance. The author is setting a firm boundary based on his beliefs and professional experience. \n\nI need to consider if an ultimatum is a valid approach in this scenario. While it's important to respect each other's values, the author is making it clear that this is a non-negotiable issue for him. However, ultimatums can be seen as coercive, especially in a relationship where both parties are supposed to make compromises. The fianc\u00e9e's change of heart might indicate that she's not fully committed to the agreement they made. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is standing firm on something he considers crucial for the children's health. He's provided evidence and tried to reason with her, but she's not budging. His stance is based on facts and public health data, which he's shared. \n\nBut is it wrong to walk away over this? It's a significant decision, and it's possible that the fianc\u00e9e's current position isn't aligned with their original agreement. However, the way the ultimatum was presented might be the issue. If he's giving her no room to reconsider or discuss further, it could be seen as controlling. \n\nThere's also the aspect of respect. Even if he's in the right about vaccines, the method of handling the disagreement matters. Relationships require mutual respect, and using an ultimatum can strain that. However, if the issue is non-negotiable for both parties, then it's a matter of values clashing. \n\nIn summary, the author is not in the wrong for setting a boundary on something he's clear about, especially since it's a health-related issue. But the method of presenting the ultimatum might be problematic. However, given the fianc\u00e9e's initial agreement and her current stance, the author's firmness is understandable from a health perspective. So, the answer is B (No).\n"
