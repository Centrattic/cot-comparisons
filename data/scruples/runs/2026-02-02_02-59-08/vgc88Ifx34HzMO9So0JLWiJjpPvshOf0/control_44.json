Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a fianc\u00e9e who is against vaccines, and the author is giving her an ultimatum. The author knew she was unvaccinated before proposing and they had discussed alternative schedules. They agreed that the kids would be vaccinated somehow.\n\nNow, a month into engagement, the fianc\u00e9e is even more against vaccines, especially Hep B at birth. The author is a healthcare worker and is concerned about the risk of the baby getting Hep B from others. He offers a compromise of waiting a month before starting any schedule. The fianc\u00e9e is upset, calling him manipulative and abusive for the ultimatum. She had previously agreed to work towards vaccination but now isn't willing to budge despite presented evidence.\n\nThe author is asking if he's in the wrong for giving an ultimatum. So, first, did they have an agreement beforehand? Yes, they had discussed alternative schedules. Then, when the fianc\u00e9e is still not on board, the author sets a boundary. Is setting a boundary acceptable? Well, if you have a core value that you're not willing to compromise on, like vaccinating children, it's reasonable to set that as a condition for the relationship. However, giving an ultimatum can be seen as extreme, especially if the fianc\u00e9e felt pressured or if the compromise isn't sufficient.\n\nBut wait, the author did offer a slight compromise (waiting a month), which is more lenient than standard schedules. The fianc\u00e9e's stance has shifted from being willing to work towards vaccination to being vehemently against it. The author is trying to protect the child's health based on his profession and data. The fianc\u00e9e is not changing her mind despite evidence. So, the author is trying to balance his values with her objections, but she's not budging. \n\nIs the author wrong? It's about whether the ultimatum is justified. If both parties can't meet in the middle and one has non-negotiable values, it's not necessarily wrong to set those boundaries. However, the ultimatum might be seen as harsh if it's a deal-breaker for the relationship. But considering the author's stance was made clear from the start, maybe it's reasonable. The fianc\u00e9e's accusation of manipulation might be an overreaction since the author had prior discussions. \n\nAlternatively, is the author being too controlling? The fianc\u00e9e might feel her autonomy is being violated. But if the author made his position clear early on and she agreed, then it's a matter of following through. The key points are prior agreement and non-negotiable values. The author is not forcing vaccines but setting a limit. So, in this case, the author might not be in the wrong because he's standing by a pre-existing agreement and his professional concerns.\n"
