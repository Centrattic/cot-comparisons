Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for giving an ultimatum about vaccines to their fianc\u00e9e. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author and their fianc\u00e9e had previously discussed an alternative vaccine schedule. Now, the fianc\u00e9e is more opposed than before, especially against the Hep B vaccine at birth. The author, a healthcare worker, is firm about some vaccination, giving a one-month window before starting an alternative schedule. The fianc\u00e9e is upset, accusing the author of being manipulative and abusive.\n\nSo, the key points are: prior agreement, fianc\u00e9e changed her stance, author sets a firm deadline, fianc\u00e9e is now upset. The author is a healthcare worker, which adds weight to their concern about infections. The fianc\u00e9e's arguments include conspiracy theories and disbelief in vaccine effectiveness despite data presented.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the author is standing by their non-negotiable stance on vaccination, which is based on their professional background and health concerns. However, giving an ultimatum in a relationship is a heavy step. The question is whether it's justified.\n\nIn some cultures or perspectives, having a firm stance on child rearing is seen as responsible, especially when health is at stake. But others might argue that the author should have found a middle ground or sought couples counseling before an ultimatum. However, the fianc\u00e9e's position is not just a preference but a rejection of medical consensus, which can pose real health risks. The author is trying to protect the child they are planning to have, which is a significant responsibility.\n\nThe author mentions that they discussed this before the engagement, but the fianc\u00e9e's stance has hardened. It's possible that the author didn't anticipate such a shift, leading to the ultimatum. The fianc\u00e9e's accusations of manipulation might be valid if the author didn't adequately consider her feelings or if the ultimatum was sudden. However, the author is also in their rights to set boundaries, especially regarding their child's health.\n\nUltimately, it's a complex situation. The author's actions are based on health and safety concerns, but the method of handling it (ultimatum) could be seen as harsh. However, when it comes to child welfare, some might side with the author's firm stance. So, the answer is likely B (not in the wrong) because they're prioritizing the child's health based on their profession and research, despite the relationship strain.\n"
