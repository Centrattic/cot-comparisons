Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for giving a vaccination ultimatum to their fianc\u00e9e.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author knew their fianc\u00e9e was unvaccinated before proposing and they had discussed alternative vaccine schedules. They agreed that the kids would be vaccinated. However, after the engagement, the fianc\u00e9e became more opposed, especially to the Hep B vaccine at birth. The author, a healthcare worker, is concerned about the risk of the baby getting sick and has set a limit: the baby can't go more than a month without starting some schedule. The fianc\u00e9e is upset, calling it manipulative and abusive, and the author is wondering if they're in the wrong.\n\nSo, the key points are: prior agreement, fianc\u00e9e changed her stance, author is firm on vaccines, leading to conflict. \n\nNow, considering ethics and relationships. In a relationship, both parties should respect each other's values and make compromises. However, when it comes to medical decisions for children, parents have differing opinions. The author is standing by their belief in vaccines, which are medically supported. The fianc\u00e9e is anti-vax, which is against scientific consensus.\n\nThe author isn't forcing the fianc\u00e9e to vaccinate herself, but is setting a boundary for the children. They\u2019re not taking a hard line on the exact schedule but allowing some flexibility with a maximum delay of a month. The fianc\u00e9e's opposition is based on misinformation (Big Pharma conspiracy, vaccines don't work), despite being shown data and evidence.\n\nIs it wrong to walk away from a relationship over a fundamental disagreement on child-rearing? It's a matter of personal values and priorities. If one parent is completely against medical consensus and won't budge, the other may feel it's necessary to set a boundary to protect the child's health. The author isn't being coercive but is clear about their stance, which they had communicated early on.\n\nHowever, giving an ultimatum can be seen as extreme. The fianc\u00e9e might feel pressured, and the author's approach could be perceived as controlling. But the author's position is based on health concerns for the child, which is a valid and serious matter. The fianc\u00e9e changed her position after the engagement, which complicates things. The author had warned earlier about their stance on vaccines, so the fianc\u00e9e should have known this could be a deal-breaker.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a complex issue. The author's actions are a reflection of their commitment to their values and child's health. The fianc\u00e9e's resistance is based on misinformation and a change of heart. The author isn't in the wrong for setting a boundary that protects their child's health, especially when the alternative would put the child at risk. So, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
