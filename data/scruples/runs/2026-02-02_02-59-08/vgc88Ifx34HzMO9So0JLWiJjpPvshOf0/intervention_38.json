Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong. The author is a fianc\u00e9 who gave an ultimatum regarding vaccines to their fianc\u00e9e. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The fianc\u00e9e was unvaccinated and they discussed alternative schedules before getting engaged. Now, after a month of engagement, she's more opposed to vaccines, specifically the Hep B vaccine at birth, even though there's no risk there. The author, a healthcare worker, set an ultimatum that the baby can't start any alternative schedule beyond one month. The fianc\u00e9e is upset, calling the author manipulative and abusive.\n\nThe author feels they are justified because they've discussed this before, the fianc\u00e9e agreed to work towards vaccination, and they're citing data from WHO and CDC to support vaccines. The fianc\u00e9e, on the other hand, believes vaccines are a hoax and doesn't want them. The author is now considering walking away if the fianc\u00e9e doesn't comply.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points are consent, ultimatums, and mutual respect. In a healthy relationship, both partners should have mutual agreement on important issues like child-rearing. The author tried to find a middle ground with an alternative schedule but now has a firm line. However, giving an ultimatum, especially on such a sensitive and personal matter, could be seen as controlling. The fianc\u00e9e might feel pressured and not truly in agreement. \n\nBut the author argues that they had the discussion before, and the fianc\u00e9e changed her stance. The author is also concerned about health risks, being a healthcare worker. However, the fianc\u00e9e's stance is rooted in personal beliefs, which the author hasn't been able to change despite evidence. \n\nIs it right to force a partner to adhere to one's views, even if they disagree? Relationships require compromise. If the author is unwilling to adjust their stance beyond a month, and the fianc\u00e9e is unwilling to vaccinate, it's a dealbreaker. But the method (ultimatum) might be the issue. The author could be seen as in the right to follow their convictions, but using an ultimatum might be seen as the wrong approach. However, since it's about a fundamental difference in parenting, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. It's a tough call. But given that they had prior agreement and she changed her mind, the author's stance might be justified. Alternatively, the ultimatum could be seen as too harsh. I'm a bit conflicted. Maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong) because it's about their core beliefs and the author is standing by their decision, but the method of ultimatum might be the issue. But according to the user's initial thought, they think the author is in the wrong. Hmm.\n"
