Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author and their fianc\u00e9e were discussing vaccines before they got engaged. They talked about alternative schedules, maybe a different country's schedule to ease her concerns about overloading the baby's body. They agreed that the kids would be vaccinated but on some schedule. Now, a month into engagement, the fianc\u00e9e is bringing up her opposition again, especially against the Hep B vaccine at birth. The author is a healthcare worker and is concerned about the risk of the baby being exposed to Hep B if unvaccinated, especially since the fianc\u00e9e has no medical history indicating she's positive for Hep B. The author's maximum compromise is waiting a month before starting an alternative schedule. The fianc\u00e9e is now upset, calling the author manipulative and abusive because of the ultimatum. She had previously agreed that vaccines were okay but now seems to be changing her stance. The author is considering walking away if she doesn't agree to the condition.\n\nThe key points here are the initial agreement, the fianc\u00e9e's change of heart, and the ultimatum given by the author. The author is in a position where their personal beliefs about vaccination are being challenged by their partner's shift in stance. The author is a healthcare worker, which adds credibility to their concerns about risks. The fianc\u00e9e, however, has moved from being open to working towards vaccination to becoming anti-vaccine, citing conspiracy theories about Big Pharma. \n\nNow, considering the context of a committed relationship, especially one that's moving towards marriage and having children, both partners need to make compromises. The author tried to find a middle ground by allowing an alternative schedule with a one-month delay, which is a significant concession considering the initial agreement. The fianc\u00e9e's refusal to budge, despite evidence and data presented, suggests a fundamental disagreement on the issue. \n\nIs the author wrong for setting a boundary? In relationships, it's important for both partners to respect each other's non-negotiables. The author clearly communicated their stance before the engagement, and the fianc\u00e9e initially agreed. Now, after a shift in her opinion, the author is standing by their position. While ultimatums can be stressful, they are sometimes necessary when core values are involved, especially regarding the health and safety of future children. \n\nHowever, the fianc\u00e9e's reaction, calling the author manipulative and abusive, might be an overreaction, but it's also valid to feel pressured when a partner sets strict boundaries. The question is whether the author's ultimatum is a reasonable way to address a non-negotiable issue. Given that the author had discussed their stance early on and compromised as much as possible (with the one-month delay), it seems the author is protecting their values and the health of future children. \n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9e's change of heart could be due to new information or evolving beliefs, but the author had already made their position clear. The author isn't forcing vaccines but is setting a limit on when they can be delayed, which is a reasonable boundary. The author's position isn't about control but about adhering to their own values and health concerns. \n\nSo, considering all these factors, I think the author is not in the wrong. They've made their stance clear, attempted compromise, and now are standing by their decision when faced with a shift in their partner's position. The fianc\u00e9e's reaction might be emotional, but the author's actions are about protecting their values and the child's health. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
