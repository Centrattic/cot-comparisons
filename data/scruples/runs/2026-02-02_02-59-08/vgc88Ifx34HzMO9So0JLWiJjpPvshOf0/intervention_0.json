Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is about a fianc\u00e9e who's against vaccines, and the author gave an ultimatum.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the details. The author knew the fianc\u00e9e was unvaccinated before proposing. They discussed alternative schedules, maybe from another country, to ease her concerns. They agreed that the kids would be vaccinated. Now, after a month, she's more opposed, especially to the Hep B vaccine at birth. The author, a healthcare worker, is concerned about risks and wants the baby to start on a modified schedule but within a month. He's given her an ultimatum, and she's calling it manipulative and abusive. He doesn't want the relationship to end but is willing to walk away if she won't agree.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to evaluate both sides. The author's stance is based on wanting vaccinated children, which they considered before the engagement. The fianc\u00e9e, on the other hand, has strong anti-vaccine views despite evidence presented. The ultimatum is about setting a boundary based on personal values and health concerns.\n\nFrom a relationship perspective, ultimatums can be tough. But the author has tried to compromise by allowing a modified schedule. The fianc\u00e9e's refusal to budge, even with data and evidence, shows she's not willing to meet halfway. The author's position is about a fundamental value (child's health) that they discussed upfront. It's a matter of whether the ultimatum is fair given prior agreements. \n\nConsidering that the author made their stance clear from the start and offered a compromise, the decision to set a boundary might be justified. However, the way it's framed as an ultimatum could be seen as harsh. But given the importance of the issue and the fianc\u00e9e's unwillingness to compromise, the author might not be in the wrong. The key points are prior discussion, compromise offered, and the fianc\u00e9e's refusal to adjust despite evidence. So the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong). But there's a nuance here. Maybe the ultimatum is too abrupt, but given the circumstances, maybe it's reasonable. I think the author is in the right because they communicated their stance early, tried to find a middle ground, and the fianc\u00e9e isn't willing to budge. So the answer is B.\n"
