Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So the user is asking if the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for giving an ultimatum to their fianc\u00e9e over vaccines. The situation involves the fianc\u00e9e being unvaccinated and the author setting a firm line about vaccinating their future children. \n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author mentions that they discussed vaccination schedules before proposing, agreeing that the kids would be vaccinated. Now, after a month of engagement, the fianc\u00e9e is more opposed, even to the Hep B vaccine at birth, which she thinks is unnecessary. The author, being a healthcare worker, is concerned about risks and is only willing to delay vaccines by a month. They gave her an ultimatum, leading to her feeling manipulated and the relationship possibly ending.\n\nThe key points here are consent in a relationship, communication, and the validity of the author's stance on vaccines. The author set boundaries based on their beliefs and profession, which is reasonable. However, ultimatums can be a sensitive area in relationships. The fianc\u00e9e feels coerced into changing her views, which she holds strongly. \n\nBut the author argues they tried to compromise by suggesting an alternative schedule initially. Now, after the fianc\u00e9e's stance hardened, they set a firm limit. Since vaccines are a medical decision, and the author is concerned about their children's health, their position is defensible. However, the ultimatum might be seen as extreme, especially if the fianc\u00e9e's stance isn't based on evidence but on personal beliefs.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9e's refusal to accept even a delayed schedule, despite evidence presented, shows she's not willing to compromise. The author's compromise was already adjusted from the original agreement. So, given that both parties have made their positions clear, the author isn't necessarily wrong for standing their ground, especially since they communicated their stance early on. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer hinges on whether giving an ultimatum on such a significant medical decision is fair. Since vaccines are crucial for public health and the author's concern is legitimate, their decision to set a firm boundary isn't in the wrong. The fianc\u00e9e, however, might be in the wrong for not compromising. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
