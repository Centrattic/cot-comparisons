Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for giving an ultimatum about vaccines to their fianc\u00e9e. \n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author is a healthcare worker and wants their kids vaccinated. They proposed an alternative schedule but have a limit: the baby can't go unvaccinated for more than a month. The fianc\u00e9e is against vaccines, thinks they're a hoax, and now the author is giving an ultimatum, leading to conflict.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to consider the nuances. Vaccine hesitancy is a sensitive topic. The fianc\u00e9e's stance is based on distrust of big pharma and believes vaccines don't work, despite evidence. The author is firm because of their profession and health concerns.\n\nNow, the question is about whether the author is wrong for setting this ultimatum. On one hand, the author has valid reasons related to public health and their professional expertise. On the other, the fianc\u00e9e feels pressured and accused of being manipulative. \n\nThe author gave her a choice, which is a personal decision in a relationship. But is it wrong to prioritize your values in a marriage? The fianc\u00e9e might feel disrespected, but the author isn't forcing her; they're stating their non-negotiable. \n\nIn terms of ethics, if the author is not being abusive, just stating their boundaries, then they might not be in the wrong. However, the way it's framed as an ultimatum could be seen as controlling. But given the context of a future child's health, it's a serious issue. \n\nSo, considering all angles, the author might not be in the wrong because they're making a decision based on their beliefs and professional knowledge, within the context of a relationship where both parties should have discussed such important matters beforehand.\n"
