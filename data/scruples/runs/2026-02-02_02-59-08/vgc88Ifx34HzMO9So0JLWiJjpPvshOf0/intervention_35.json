Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the original post (AITA) is in the wrong. The situation is about a fianc\u00e9e who is against vaccines, and the author is giving an ultimatum.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author knew the fianc\u00e9e was unvaccinated before proposing. They had discussed alternative schedules, but after a month, the fianc\u00e9e became more opposed. The author, as a healthcare worker, is concerned about the baby's vaccination and sets a firm limit\u2014either follow a modified schedule or break up. The fianc\u00e9e is upset, calling the author manipulative and abusive, and the author is asking if they're in the wrong.\n\nNow, considering the ethical aspects. Vaccines are a sensitive topic. The author is standing by their convictions, which are important to them, but is it reasonable to end a relationship over this? The fianc\u00e9e's stance is based on her beliefs, even though they are against medical consensus. The author provided evidence, but she's not budging. \n\nIs the author wrong for setting such a strict ultimatum? It's a personal choice, but is it fair to end a relationship because of differing values? Some might say that while the author's position is valid, using an ultimatum is extreme. Others might argue that it's their right to make decisions about their child's health. Also, the fianc\u00e9e's views are harmful and could affect the child's health. \n\nThe author is a healthcare worker, so their perspective is informed by their profession. However, the fianc\u00e9e's distrust of big pharma and vaccines is a belief she's holding strongly. The author tried to compromise with a modified schedule but is now firm. \n\nIn relationships, major disagreements can lead to breaking up. But the author is using an ultimatum, which is a significant decision. Whether it's right or wrong depends on balancing personal values and respect for the partner's autonomy. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether setting such a strict boundary is fair. The author isn't forcing vaccines, just a modified schedule beyond a certain point. However, the fianc\u00e9e's rejection of vaccines altogether is a non-negotiable for the author. \n\nI'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong (B), because they're making a decision based on their values and the child's health. But some might say it's too harsh. However, the fianc\u00e9e's stance is against medical advice, so the author's ultimatum might be justified from their perspective.\n"
