Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a fianc\u00e9e who's unvaccinated and the fianc\u00e9 is giving her an ultimatum over vaccines for their future children.\n\nFirst, the author knew his fianc\u00e9e's stance before proposing and they discussed alternative schedules. So he wasn't completely blindsided. He's a healthcare worker, which probably influences his perspective. He's set a limit where he's willing to let the baby wait a month before starting an alternative schedule. But she's now upset, calling him manipulative and abusive for giving ultimatums. She also previously agreed to work towards vaccination but now isn't. \n\nThe key points here are consent and ultimatums. The author is using an ultimatum, which can be a red flag in relationships. It might seem controlling if he's not being flexible. However, he's setting boundaries based on his beliefs and career. The fianc\u00e9e's stance has shifted, and she's holding strong anti-vaccine views despite evidence. \n\nOn one hand, the author is standing by his principles, which is important, especially when it comes to health decisions. On the other hand, forcing someone into a situation where they have to choose between their beliefs and the relationship can be seen as abusive. The question is whether the author's ultimatum is reasonable or overstepping.\n\nBut the author mentions they had prior discussions and agreed on something. Now she's going back on that agreement. He's adjusting his stance based on her current position. The problem is the ultimatum itself. Even if the author has valid reasons, using an ultimatum to end the relationship over this could be seen as extreme. However, if she's not willing to compromise and he's clear about his boundaries, maybe he's not at fault.\n\nI think it's a tough call. The author isn't wrong for having strong beliefs, but using an ultimatum might be crossing a line. But given that she's not budging and he's made it clear from the start, maybe he's not in the wrong. It's a situation where both sides have their own convictions, and the ultimatum is a consequence of her refusal to meet his conditions.\n"
