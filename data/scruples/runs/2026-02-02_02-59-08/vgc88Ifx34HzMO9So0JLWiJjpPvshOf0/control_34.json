Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this. The user is asking whether the author (the fianc\u00e9) is in the wrong for giving an ultimatum regarding vaccines. The situation involves a fianc\u00e9e who's against vaccines, and he's standing his ground. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. They were planning to have kids, and vaccines were a topic discussed before engagement. The fianc\u00e9e is against Hep B at birth, which is a common vaccine given immediately after birth. The author is a healthcare worker, so he's likely more informed about the risks. He's given her a compromise of a one-month delay before an alternative schedule. She's now upset, calling him manipulative and abusive for setting this ultimatum.\n\nThe key points here are consent and communication. They had discussed this before, and she agreed to work towards vaccination. Now she's changed her stance. The author is firm because he's in a healthcare setting and wants to minimize risks. But is an ultimatum the right approach? \n\nOn one hand, the author has valid concerns about public health and the well-being of their future children. Vaccines are proven to be effective, and his stance is backed by medical data. On the other hand, ultimatums can be seen as controlling, especially if they involve someone's autonomy over their child's healthcare. The fianc\u00e9e might feel that her views are being dismissed, even if they're based on misinformation. \n\nBut the author did try to compromise by allowing a delay and alternative schedules. He also presented evidence, which she's not accepting. The question is whether being firm in a health-related decision is wrong. In such matters, personal beliefs can clash, and it's a tough spot. However, if both parties can't agree, it's a matter of what one is willing to tolerate. The author isn't forcing her but setting boundaries based on his beliefs. \n\nIn relationships, major life decisions require mutual agreement. If both can't find a middle ground, it's a test of values. The author's approach might be seen as necessary for him, but the fianc\u00e9e's reaction shows how sensitive this issue is. The ultimatum isn't about control but about non-negotiables. So, is he in the wrong? If he's given a reasonable compromise and she's not budging, maybe not. But if the ultimatum is seen as coercive, then perhaps yes. However, given the health implications, it's a complex issue. \n\nFinal thoughts: Health decisions for children are critical. The author's stance is based on evidence, and he's offering a compromise. His fianc\u00e9e's refusal despite evidence could be the root of the conflict. The author isn't necessarily wrong for setting a boundary he can't cross.\n"
