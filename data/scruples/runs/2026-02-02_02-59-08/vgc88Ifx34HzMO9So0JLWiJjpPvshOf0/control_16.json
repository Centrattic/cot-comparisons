Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user provided a Reddit-style \"Am I the Asshole?\" story where the author is engaged to someone who is against vaccines. The author knew their fianc\u00e9e was unvaccinated before proposing and had discussed alternative schedules. Now, the fianc\u00e9e is more against vaccines, especially the Hep B vaccine at birth. The author, a healthcare worker, wants the kids vaccinated and gives an ultimatum: either follow a modified schedule (like delaying by one month) or the relationship ends. The fianc\u00e9e is upset, calling it manipulative and abusive. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze both sides. The author's stance is based on wanting their children vaccinated, which aligns with public health recommendations. They've tried to meet her halfway with alternative schedules, even allowing a delay. The fianc\u00e9e, on the other hand, has strong anti-vaccine beliefs, even citing conspiracy theories about Big Pharma and questioning vaccine efficacy despite evidence presented. She's unwilling to budge, leading to the ultimatum.\n\nThe key points here are about autonomy and decision-making in relationships. The author is setting boundaries regarding their own health and their future children's health. They\u2019re a healthcare worker, so they might have more trust in the medical system. The fianc\u00e9e's refusal to consider vaccines, despite evidence, could be seen as putting the children at risk. The author's ultimatum is a way to enforce their non-negotiable boundary.\n\nHowever, the way the ultimatum is framed could be problematic. Giving someone an ultimatum is a serious step and can be perceived as controlling. The fianc\u00e9e might feel that her autonomy is being violated, especially if she's being asked to change her deeply held beliefs. But the author argues that this is a fundamental issue for them, so they're not in the wrong for setting a boundary.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9e's initial agreement to work towards vaccination but now being opposed could indicate inconsistency. The author might feel they've been honest from the start, so the fianc\u00e9e is the one changing her stance. However, the author's response might be seen as too harsh, especially if the fianc\u00e9e's beliefs are based on misinformation but not harmful in practice. Yet, the author isn't forcing her to vaccinate immediately; they're allowing a delay.\n\nIn terms of ethics, vaccines are a public health issue, and the author has a right to protect their children. The fianc\u00e9e's refusal could pose a risk to the children's health. The author's ultimatum is about their non-negotiables, which is a reasonable approach in a relationship. However, the emotional impact on the fianc\u00e9e and the potential for coercion need to be considered. But given the circumstances, the author isn't wrong for protecting their health values.\n"
