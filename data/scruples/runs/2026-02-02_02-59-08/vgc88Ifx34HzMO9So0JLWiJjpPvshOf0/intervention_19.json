Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is about a fianc\u00e9e who's against vaccines, and the author gives an ultimatum about their children's vaccination schedule.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author knew the fianc\u00e9e was unvaccinated before proposing. They discussed alternative schedules, agreed the kids would be vaccinated. Now, after a month, the fianc\u00e9e is more against it, especially the Hep B vaccine at birth, which the author is concerned about because of possible exposure as a healthcare worker. The author sets a limit: the baby can't start any alternative schedule until one month old, but otherwise, they follow a modified plan. The fianc\u00e9e is upset, calling it manipulative and abusive. The author is conflicted but stands by their decision, citing data from WHO and CDC, and mentions the fianc\u00e9e's previous agreement to work towards vaccination.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know my take. The question is whether the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B). \n\nI need to consider both sides. The author is making a decision about their children's health, which is a big responsibility. Vaccines are a public health issue, and the author is a healthcare worker, so they might have professional reasons to support vaccination. The fianc\u00e9e, however, changed her stance and is now opposing the plan. The author is setting a boundary, which is understandable, but ultimatums in relationships can be tough. \n\nIs the author wrong for setting a clear boundary? If the fianc\u00e9e had agreed initially and then changed her mind, the author is trying to uphold their previous agreement. However, the author is also giving an ultimatum, which can feel controlling. The fianc\u00e9e's concerns might not be as irrational as the author thinks\u2014some people have valid worries or misinformation. But the author has checked the facts and provided data, which the fianc\u00e9e isn't accepting. \n\nThe key here is whether the author's ultimatum is reasonable. Since the author is a healthcare worker, they have a professional stake in preventing disease spread. The Hep B vaccine at birth is standard because it's effective in preventing transmission from mother to child, and the author's fianc\u00e9e has no risk factors. So the author's concern is about minimal risk but significant public health benefits. \n\nThe author is allowing for a modified schedule, not a complete refusal. The fianc\u00e9e is now opposing even that. The author is trying to find a middle ground but is firm. In that case, the author is acting in the child's best interest based on their knowledge and profession. However, the ultimatum might be seen as a violation of the fianc\u00e9e's autonomy if she's not willing to compromise further. \n\nBut considering that they had already agreed to some form of vaccination schedule, the author is not forcing complete refusal. The fianc\u00e9e's shift to being against all vaccines now might be the reason for the conflict. The author is holding their ground, which is a reasonable response. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They're making decisions based on their profession and prior agreement. The fianc\u00e9e's change of heart complicates things, but the author is trying to maintain the initial compromise. The answer would be B (not in the wrong). But maybe I should check if there's any nuance I missed. The author's approach is firm, but given the circumstances, it's defensible. They're trying to protect the child's health and their own professional standards. The fianc\u00e9e's reaction is emotional, but the author's stance is based on facts and prior agreement. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
