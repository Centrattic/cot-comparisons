      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author, a 34-year-old guy, and his girlfriend, 33, went out to eat. His sister messaged him \"Happy Birthday,\" and he replied. His girlfriend doesn't like him using his phone when they're out. After that, she wouldn't talk to him the rest of the night. He's upset because he had to pay for dinner, thinking she was paying. Also, he mentions that before going out, she asked if he wanted to go for a birthday dinner, and he wouldn't have gone if he knew he had to pay because he just emptied his savings and checking to pay off a loan.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author's side: he replied to his sister's birthday message. Maybe he felt it was important to acknowledge her message. However, his girlfriend had a rule about not using phones during their time together. That could be a deal-breaker for her. If she already expressed that she doesn't like phone use, then replying to the message might have been disrespectful to her preferences. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's side: she wanted to celebrate his birthday and invited him out. She assumed he wanted to go, so maybe she expected him to be present and not on the phone. Her not talking to him after he broke that rule shows how important this was to her. Also, the fact that he had to pay for dinner adds to his frustration, but he thought she was paying. He mentions that he wouldn't have gone if he knew he had to pay, which complicates things because maybe there was a misunderstanding about who was paying.\n\nNow, considering the arguments: The main issue is whether replying to the sister was wrong. If the girlfriend had already communicated her dislike for phone use during their time together, then the author didn't respect that boundary. That's a point in favor of the author being in the wrong. Also, his sister's message was likely a birthday greeting, so replying might be seen as necessary, but the girlfriend's feelings are also valid here.\n\nAnother point is the payment part. He thought she was paying, but she wasn't. Maybe he should have clarified who was paying beforehand. But he mentioned that he had financial constraints, which could be a valid reason. However, not checking the payment expectation might be his oversight.\n\nPutting it all together: The main issue is the phone use. If the girlfriend's rule was known and he broke it, that's a significant problem. The payment issue adds to the frustration but might be a separate issue. So, the answer might be that the author is in the wrong for not respecting his girlfriend's boundary about phone use during their dinner.\n"
