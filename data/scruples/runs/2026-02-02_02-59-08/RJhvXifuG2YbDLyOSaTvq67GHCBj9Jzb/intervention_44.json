Afterwards she wouldn't talk to me the rest of the night.  I'm still pissed off, I can never catch a break.  I also had to pay for dinner, I assumed she was paying.  I should also add, before we went out she asked something along the lines of \"do you want to go out for a birthday dinner?\" I wouldn't have went if I knew I was paying because I just emptied my savings and checking to pay off a loan.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for replying to their sister's birthday message during dinner. Let's see.\n\nFirst, the author's girlfriend doesn't like when he uses his phone during meals. So, he used his phone to respond to his sister, which made her upset and caused her to not talk to him the rest of the night. That's a big issue because they were on a date, and phone use was a known pet peeve. The author is frustrated because he had to pay for dinner, which he thought his girlfriend would cover. He also mentions that he just paid off a loan and had no money left, which adds context about his financial situation.\n\nThe key points here are: 1) The girlfriend had previously mentioned not liking phone use during meals, so the author should have been aware. 2) He used his phone anyway, which upset her. 3) He assumed she would pay for dinner, but she didn't, leading to more tension. \n\nHe also mentions that his sister asked if he wanted to go out for birthday dinner. Wait, no, actually the sister is separate from the girlfriend. The sister sent the birthday message during the dinner with the girlfriend. The girlfriend had asked if he wanted to go out for his birthday dinner, and he agreed. But he thought she would pay, but she didn't. So he's out of money and now has to pay for dinner, which he's upset about.\n\nSo, the main issue is using the phone despite knowing it's a problem for his girlfriend. Even if the sister's message was about his birthday, he could have waited to respond. Also, the financial aspect adds to his frustration, but the immediate problem was the phone use. The girlfriend's boundaries were ignored, leading to the conflict. \n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. The question is whether the author is wrong for replying. Given that the girlfriend had made it clear she didn't like phone use during meals, and he ignored that, it's likely he's in the wrong. The financial issue is a separate problem, but the phone use directly caused the conflict. So the answer is A.\n"
