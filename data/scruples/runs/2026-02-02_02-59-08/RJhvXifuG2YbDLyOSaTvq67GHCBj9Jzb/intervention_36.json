Afterwards she wouldn't talk to me the rest of the night.  I'm still pissed off, I can never catch a break.  I also had to pay for dinner, I assumed she was paying.  I should also add, before we went out she asked something along the lines of \"do you want to go out for a birthday dinner?\" I wouldn't have went if I knew I was paying because I just emptied my savings and checking to pay off a loan.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for replying to their sister's birthday message while on a date with their girlfriend. The GF doesn't like when he uses his phone during meals, and after replying, she became upset and didn't talk to him the rest of the night. Also, he had to pay for dinner, which he thought she would cover.\n\nFirst, the main issue is using the phone during the date. The GF has already expressed that she doesn't like when he uses his phone while they're out. The sister's message was a birthday wish, which is a valid reason to respond. However, the GF's feelings about phone use might be more about wanting undivided attention from her boyfriend. So, replying to the sister could be seen as prioritizing the sister over the girlfriend's comfort, leading to the GF's upset reaction.\n\nSecond, the payment issue. The author thought the GF would pay, but she didn't. This could be a communication breakdown. If he assumed she would pay without discussing it, that's an oversight. However, the GF might have had her own expectations. The author's financial situation was tight, which adds context, but he might have taken the initiative to check if she expected to pay.\n\nConsidering both factors, the GF's main grievance was likely the phone use. Even if the message was a birthday response, the GF valued her time together without phone distractions. The author's action, while understandable, disregarded her expressed preference, leading to the argument. The payment issue might be a secondary factor but still a point of miscommunication.\n\nSo, the author is in the wrong for using his phone during the date despite knowing it upsets the GF, and for assuming she would pay without clear communication. Answer A.\n"
