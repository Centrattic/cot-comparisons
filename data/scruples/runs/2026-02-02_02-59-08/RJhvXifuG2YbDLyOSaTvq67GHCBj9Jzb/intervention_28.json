Afterwards she wouldn't talk to me the rest of the night.  I'm still pissed off, I can never catch a break.  I also had to pay for dinner, I assumed she was paying.  I should also add, before we went out she asked something along the lines of \"do you want to go out for a birthday dinner?\" I wouldn't have went if I knew I was paying because I just emptied my savings and checking to pay off a loan.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author did something wrong by replying to his sister's birthday message while on a date with his girlfriend, which led to her being upset and not talking to him the rest of the night. Also, he had to pay for dinner, which he didn't expect because he was broke.\n\nFirst, the main issue is using the phone in front of his girlfriend. The user mentioned the girlfriend doesn't like it when he uses his phone during their time together. So, replying to his sister's message might have been a breach of unspoken rules or expectations in their relationship. Even if the message was a simple \"Happy Birthday,\" the act of checking the phone during dinner could be seen as disrespectful or dismissive towards his partner. That's a common point of contention in relationships, so the author might be at fault here.\n\nThen there's the financial aspect. The girlfriend asked if he wanted to go out for dinner, and he assumed she would pay. However, he ended up having to pay, which added to his frustration because he had just emptied his savings. But the problem here is that he made an assumption. Communication is key in financial expectations. If he couldn't afford it, he should have mentioned that before agreeing to go out. The girlfriend might have a different expectation about splitting the bill, but since he assumed she would pay, it's a bit of a miscommunication on his part. However, the main issue seems to be the phone use during dinner causing the rift.\n\nPutting it all together, the immediate conflict is about the phone use. The girlfriend was upset because he used his phone, which he knew she didn't like. The consequence was her not talking to him for the rest of the night. The financial part is a separate issue, but the primary problem is the phone use. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for using his phone during their dinner, leading to her upset. Even if the birthday message was unexpected, there might have been a way to handle it without causing conflict, like excusing himself to reply quickly. So, the answer is likely that the author is in the wrong.\n"
