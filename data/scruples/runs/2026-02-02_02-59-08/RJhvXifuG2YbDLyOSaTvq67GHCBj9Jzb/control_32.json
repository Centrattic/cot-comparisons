Afterwards she wouldn't talk to me the rest of the night.  I'm still pissed off, I can never catch a break.  I also had to pay for dinner, I assumed she was paying.  I should also add, before we went out she asked something along the lines of \"do you want to go out for a birthday dinner?\" I wouldn't have went if I knew I was paying because I just emptied my savings and checking to pay off a loan.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author replied to their sister's birthday message while they were out to eat with their girlfriend. The girlfriend doesn't like when he uses his phone during dates. After that, she didn't talk to him the rest of the night. Plus, he had to pay for dinner, thinking she would cover it. He mentions he just paid off a loan and was tight on money.\n\nFirst, replying to a birthday message might seem like a small thing, but if the girlfriend specifically doesn't want him using his phone during their time together, then it's a boundary he crossed. Even if the sister's message was about his birthday, honoring the girlfriend's preference would be important in maintaining respect in the relationship. So, that part might be where he went wrong.\n\nThen there's the issue of paying for dinner. He assumed she would pay, but she expected him to. That led to resentment, especially since he's in a financial bind. If he had known he had to pay, he might not have gone out. However, maybe they had a prior understanding or it's customary in their relationship for the person initiating the dinner to pay. But since he didn't mention that beforehand, it could have been a miscommunication. \n\nPutting it all together, the main points are using the phone against her wishes and the financial assumption. Both actions caused her to withdraw from the evening. While the phone use was a direct violation of her boundaries, the payment issue might be a misunderstanding. However, not addressing her feelings about the phone use and the resulting silence could have made things worse. So, the author's actions led to a negative outcome, so he might be in the wrong.\n"
