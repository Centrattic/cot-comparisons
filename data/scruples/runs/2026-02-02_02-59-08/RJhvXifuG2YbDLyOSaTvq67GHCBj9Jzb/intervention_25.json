Afterwards she wouldn't talk to me the rest of the night.  I'm still pissed off, I can never catch a break.  I also had to pay for dinner, I assumed she was paying.  I should also add, before we went out she asked something along the lines of \"do you want to go out for a birthday dinner?\" I wouldn't have went if I knew I was paying because I just emptied my savings and checking to pay off a loan.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The main points are:\n\n1. The author replied to his sister's birthday message when they were out to eat. His girlfriend doesn't like him using his phone during meals. After that, she stopped talking to him for the rest of the night.\n2. He was upset because he had to pay for the dinner, assuming she would cover it. He mentions he just paid off a loan and had no savings left, so he wouldn't have gone out if he knew he had to pay.\n\nFirst, the phone use: The girlfriend had expressed disapproval before. So, the author knew her preference, but he still used his phone. That seems like a mistake on his part. Even if it's a birthday message, maybe he should have waited or explained. Ignoring her previous requests might be disrespectful.\n\nSecond, the dinner payment issue. The author assumed she would pay, but she didn't. He might have been out of pocket when he couldn't afford it. However, he didn't clarify beforehand, even though she asked if he wanted to go. If he was financially strained, he should have communicated that before agreeing. Assuming she would pay without discussing it could be his fault. \n\nPutting it all together, both issues stem from not communicating his financial situation and not respecting her boundaries about phone use. The girlfriend's reaction of not talking to him was her response, but the root causes lie in the author's actions. So, he might be in the wrong for not addressing these points upfront.\n"
