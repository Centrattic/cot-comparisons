Afterwards she wouldn't talk to me the rest of the night.  I'm still pissed off, I can never catch a break.  I also had to pay for dinner, I assumed she was paying.  I should also add, before we went out she asked something along the lines of \"do you want to go out for a birthday dinner?\" I wouldn't have went if I knew I was paying because I just emptied my savings and checking to pay off a loan.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is a 34-year-old male who got a birthday message from his sister while he and his girlfriend were out to eat. He replied to her message, which upset his girlfriend because she doesn't like him using his phone during meals. After that, she stopped talking to him for the rest of the night. He's angry about it and also had to pay for dinner, which he didn't expect since he thought she would cover it. He mentions he had just emptied his savings and checking accounts to pay off a loan, so he's under financial stress.\n\nFirst, the key points here are: 1) Did the author do something wrong by replying to his sister's message? 2) Is he responsible for the girlfriend's reaction and the dinner payment? \n\nRegarding the phone use: The girlfriend had previously expressed that she doesn't like when he uses his phone when they're out. By replying to his sister's message, he disregarded her preference. This could be seen as dismissive of her feelings, possibly leading to her not talking to him the rest of the night. So, maybe he's at fault here for not respecting her boundaries.\n\nAs for the dinner payment: The user thought she would pay, but she didn't. It's unclear if there was a prior agreement. If he assumed she would pay but she had different expectations, then he might have misread the situation. However, if there was no clear agreement, both could be at fault. He also mentions financial strain, which adds context to his frustration.\n\nPutting it all together: The main issue is the phone use. If he knew she disliked it, replying was a mistake. The dinner payment issue might be a separate point of misunderstanding. The author's frustration is valid given his financial situation, but his actions during the dinner might have contributed to the problem. So, probably, he's at least partially in the wrong.\n"
