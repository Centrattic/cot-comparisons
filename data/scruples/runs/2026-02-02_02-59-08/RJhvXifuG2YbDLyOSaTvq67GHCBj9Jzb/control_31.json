Afterwards she wouldn't talk to me the rest of the night.  I'm still pissed off, I can never catch a break.  I also had to pay for dinner, I assumed she was paying.  I should also add, before we went out she asked something along the lines of \"do you want to go out for a birthday dinner?\" I wouldn't have went if I knew I was paying because I just emptied my savings and checking to pay off a loan.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for replying to his sister's birthday message while they were out to eat with his girlfriend. \n\nFirst, the girlfriend doesn't like him using his phone during meals. So, when he did reply, she got upset and didn't talk to him for the rest of the night. That's a key point. He also mentions that he had to pay for dinner, which he wasn't expecting because he thought she was paying. He had just emptied his savings and checking accounts to pay off a loan, so this was a financial strain.\n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. Let's consider both sides. On one hand, the girlfriend's feelings are valid. Many people dislike being distracted by phones during their time together. He acknowledged that she doesn't like it, so by replying, he might have prioritized his sister over her presence, which could be seen as disrespectful. Also, the financial aspect is a problem because he assumed she would pay, which led to him having to cover the cost when he was already in a tight financial situation. Miscommunication here could be his fault for not clarifying who pays.\n\nOn the other hand, replying to a birthday message is a common courtesy. Maybe he thought it was a quick response. The financial part is more about miscommunication. However, the main issue seems to be the phone use. Even if it was a quick reply, if she has a clear boundary about no phones during meals, then he should respect that. His actions led to her being upset for the rest of the night, which is significant. Plus, he's frustrated that he ended up paying when he thought she was, which adds to the tension.\n\nSo, considering the girlfriend's boundaries about phone use and the financial misunderstanding, the author might be at fault. The act of replying to the message, despite knowing her dislike, shows a lack of consideration for her feelings in the moment. Financial issues are a separate issue but contribute to the overall conflict. Therefore, he's in the wrong for not respecting her boundaries, leading to the argument and the awkward dinner.\n"
