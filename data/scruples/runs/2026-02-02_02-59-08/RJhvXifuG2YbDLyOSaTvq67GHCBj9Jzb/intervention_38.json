Afterwards she wouldn't talk to me the rest of the night.  I'm still pissed off, I can never catch a break.  I also had to pay for dinner, I assumed she was paying.  I should also add, before we went out she asked something along the lines of \"do you want to go out for a birthday dinner?\" I wouldn't have went if I knew I was paying because I just emptied my savings and checking to pay off a loan.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person in question is a 34-year-old man who went out for dinner with his girlfriend on his birthday. His sister wished him a happy birthday via message during their dinner. The girlfriend doesn't like him using his phone when they're out, so he replied to her message, which upset the girlfriend. As a result, she didn't talk to him the rest of the night. Additionally, he had to pay for dinner, thinking the girlfriend would cover it, but he was broke after paying off a loan.\n\nFirst, the main issue is whether replying to his sister's birthday message was wrong. The girlfriend's boundary is clear\u2014she doesn't like phone use during their time together. By replying, the author broke that boundary, which led to her being upset. That seems like a valid point against him.\n\nThen there's the payment issue. He assumed she would pay, but he had no money left. However, it's generally not okay to assume someone else will pay unless it's been explicitly agreed upon. If she hadn't mentioned paying beforehand and he just assumed, that's a problem. But he also mentioned she asked if he wanted to go out for dinner, and he agreed without clarifying payment. That might have contributed to the misunderstanding.\n\nHe's still angry about it, feeling like he can't catch a break. But the fact that he used his phone during their dinner was a direct violation of her preferences. Even if the message was about his birthday, he could have waited to respond after the dinner. The girlfriend's discomfort with phone use is a legitimate boundary, so ignoring it caused the conflict.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The main issue is the phone use, which he's in the wrong for. The payment issue is a separate point, but his assumption there is also a mistake. However, the primary problem here is the phone use during their dinner. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
