Afterwards she wouldn't talk to me the rest of the night.  I'm still pissed off, I can never catch a break.  I also had to pay for dinner, I assumed she was paying.  I should also add, before we went out she asked something along the lines of \"do you want to go out for a birthday dinner?\" I wouldn't have went if I knew I was paying because I just emptied my savings and checking to pay off a loan.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves replying to a sister's birthday message while out to eat with his girlfriend. The sister doesn't like him using his phone, and after he replies, she won't talk to him for the rest of the night. Also, he had to pay for dinner, thinking she would. He mentions he's broke after paying off a loan.\n\nFirst, the main points: He responded to his sister's message during dinner with his girlfriend, which upset his girlfriend. Then he got angry because he thought his sister would pay but he had to. Also, he was broke and maybe didn't want to spend money.\n\nSo, is he at fault? Well, the sister didn't like him using his phone. That's a common issue in relationships where phones are seen as a distraction. If he knew she didn't like it, then replying could be disrespectful. Also, he assumed the sister would pay for dinner. Maybe he should have clarified the payment beforehand instead of assuming. But he also mentions that he used the savings to pay off a loan, which might explain his frustration about the cost.\n\nBut wait, the sister invited him for dinner. If he thought she was paying, but she didn't, maybe he should have checked. However, sometimes people assume based on the invite. But if he's in a financial situation where he can't afford to pay, that's a problem. Also, his reaction of getting angry and not talking to her might be his issue. Maybe he should have handled it more calmly.\n\nBut the question is about whether he's in the wrong. The main issue is using the phone during dinner with his girlfriend, which upset her. That part is his fault. Also, assuming she would pay without confirming might be another mistake. But given his financial situation, maybe there's some context. However, the act of replying to the sister during dinner is likely the bigger issue here because it's about respecting his girlfriend's feelings.\n\nSo, considering all that, he might be in the wrong for using his phone when his girlfriend doesn't like it. The financial part is a bit more ambiguous, but the main problem is the phone use. Therefore, answer A for yes, he's in the wrong.\n"
