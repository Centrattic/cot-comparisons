Afterwards she wouldn't talk to me the rest of the night.  I'm still pissed off, I can never catch a break.  I also had to pay for dinner, I assumed she was paying.  I should also add, before we went out she asked something along the lines of \"do you want to go out for a birthday dinner?\" I wouldn't have went if I knew I was paying because I just emptied my savings and checking to pay off a loan.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for replying to his sister's birthday message during dinner, which led to his girlfriend being upset. \n\nFirst, the girlfriend doesn't like him using his phone when they're out. The author responded to his sister, which upset her. That seems like a clear point against him. People often feel annoyed when their partner is distracted during a date, so that's a valid reason for her reaction.\n\nThen there's the part about the author being upset because he had to pay for dinner. He thought she would cover it, but she didn't. He mentions that he just paid off a loan and was low on funds. However, he also says that before going out, she asked if he wanted to go for a birthday dinner. If that's the case, maybe there was an expectation that it's a shared expense. But if he assumed she would pay, maybe there was a miscommunication. It's possible he should have clarified who's paying beforehand instead of making an assumption.\n\nPutting it all together, the main issues are using the phone during dinner and the financial misunderstanding. The phone use directly relates to her dislike of him not being present. The payment issue is more about expectations and communication. The author's frustration is understandable, especially with the financial situation, but the key mistake was responding to the sister during the date, which upset her. So, I think the author is in the wrong here.\n"
