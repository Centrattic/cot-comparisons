I should also add, before we went out she asked something along the lines of \"do you want to go out for a birthday dinner?\" I wouldn't have went if I knew I was paying because I just emptied my savings and checking to pay off a loan.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person is in the wrong here. The situation is that the guy replied to his sister's birthday message during dinner with his girlfriend. The girlfriend doesn't like him using his phone when they're out. Then she wouldn't talk to him the rest of the night. Plus, he had to pay for dinner, thinking she would, and he's broke from paying off a loan.\n\nHmm. First, the main issue is responding to the sister. The girlfriend's boundaries about phone use are important. Even if it was a birthday message, if she's expressed that she doesn't like phone use during meals, he should respect that. Maybe he could have explained he was in the middle of dinner and would reply later. But he didn't, so that's a point against him.\n\nThen there's the dinner payment issue. The user says he assumed she was paying, but she didn't. That's a problem. Even if he's broke, assuming someone else will pay without confirming is on him. Maybe he should have clarified beforehand. But he mentions she asked if he wanted to go out for dinner, which might imply a mutual decision. However, splitting costs or taking turns isn't always discussed, so if he assumed she'd pay and she expected him to, that's a miscommunication. Both might share some blame here.\n\nHe's also upset because he's broke. That adds to his frustration, but it's not an excuse for not considering her feelings about phone use. The fact that he's mad at her for not talking to him might be his own reaction, but he should have anticipated her reaction if he knew her boundaries.\n\nSo, putting it all together: replying to the sister without checking if the girlfriend was okay with it, leading to her upset and the dinner payment issue. He's in the wrong for not respecting her boundaries and maybe miscommunication about dinner costs. But maybe the girlfriend overreacted? Not sure. The main points are his actions violating her boundaries and the misassumption about payment. So, likely answer A (he's in the wrong).\n"
