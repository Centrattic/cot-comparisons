Afterwards she wouldn't talk to me the rest of the night.  I'm still pissed off, I can never catch a break.  I also had to pay for dinner, I assumed she was paying.  I should also add, before we went out she asked something along the lines of \"do you want to go out for a birthday dinner?\" I wouldn't have went if I knew I was paying because I just emptied my savings and checking to pay off a loan.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for replying to their sister's birthday message while on a dinner date with their girlfriend. The girlfriend doesn't like phone use during meals, and she was upset the rest of the night. The author is also upset because he had to pay for dinner, thinking she would cover it, and he's struggling financially after paying off a loan.\n\nFirst, the main issue is the phone use. The girlfriend had already expressed that she doesn't like when he uses his phone during their time together. The author responded to his sister, which the girlfriend found disrespectful. Even though the message was a simple \"Happy Birthday,\" the act of using the phone during dinner might have been a breach of their agreed-upon boundaries. If the girlfriend communicated her preference beforehand, the author should have respected that to avoid conflict.\n\nThen there's the financial aspect. The author thought the girlfriend would pay, but she didn't. He mentions he's in a tough financial spot, which adds to his frustration. However, assuming someone else will pay without confirmation isn't the best approach. Clear communication about splitting the bill could prevent such misunderstandings. If the girlfriend expected to pay, she might have mentioned it earlier.\n\nThe sister's message was sent before the dinner, so the author might have felt the need to respond. But considering the girlfriend's feelings about phone use, maybe he should have checked with her first or waited until they left. The situation highlights a miscommunication on both sides\u2014author didn't clarify payment expectations, and the girlfriend's disapproval of phone use wasn't perhaps made clear enough. However, the act of using the phone in a situation where the partner has expressed dislike for it is a common relationship issue. The author's main mistake was not respecting the girlfriend's preference, leading to her upset. So, the answer leans towards the author being in the wrong.\n"
