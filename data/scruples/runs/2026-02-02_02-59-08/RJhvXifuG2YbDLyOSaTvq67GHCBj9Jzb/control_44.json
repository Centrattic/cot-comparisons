Afterwards she wouldn't talk to me the rest of the night.  I'm still pissed off, I can never catch a break.  I also had to pay for dinner, I assumed she was paying.  I should also add, before we went out she asked something along the lines of \"do you want to go out for a birthday dinner?\" I wouldn't have went if I knew I was paying because I just emptied my savings and checking to pay off a loan.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for replying to his sister's birthday message while they were out to eat with his girlfriend. The main points are:\n\n1. The sister doesn't like when he uses his phone during their outings. He replied to her message, which made her upset, and she didn't talk to him the rest of the night.\n2. He had to pay for dinner, assuming she would cover it. He mentions he's broke from paying off a loan, so he's upset about that too.\n3. Before going out, she asked if he wanted to go for a birthday dinner. He didn't realize he'd have to pay, which is a problem because he's financially strained.\n\nFirst, the phone issue. The girlfriend had expressed disapproval of phone use during meals. The author replied to his sister, which she found disrespectful or inconsiderate. Even though it was a birthday message, using the phone might have been a breach of her boundary. That's a point against him.\n\nThen, the payment issue. He assumed she was paying, but she didn't clarify. However, it's common for people to split the bill or have an understanding beforehand. Since he didn't check and ended up paying when he couldn't afford it, maybe he's at fault for not confirming. But she should have clarified who's paying, especially knowing his financial situation after he mentioned paying off a loan. \n\nAlso, the sister's question about the dinner might imply she wanted to take him out, so expecting her to pay makes sense. But if there was no prior agreement, he might have been wrong to assume. However, his sister's message was just a birthday wish, not related to the dinner plans. He might have confused his sister's message with the girlfriend's dinner arrangement.\n\nPutting it all together, the author replied to his sister's message during dinner, violating the girlfriend's boundary, which led to tension. He also didn't confirm payment, leading to financial stress. These actions likely contributed to the girlfriend's upset. So, he might be in the wrong for not respecting her boundary and miscommunication about the dinner payment. However, the financial part is a bit ambiguous. But overall, the main issues are his phone use and not clarifying payment, which he could have handled better. So Answer A.\n"
