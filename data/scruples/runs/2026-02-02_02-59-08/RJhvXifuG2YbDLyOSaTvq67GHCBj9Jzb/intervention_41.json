Afterwards she wouldn't talk to me the rest of the night.  I'm still pissed off, I can never catch a break.  I also had to pay for dinner, I assumed she was paying.  I should also add, before we went out she asked something along the lines of \"do you want to go out for a birthday dinner?\" I wouldn't have went if I knew I was paying because I just emptied my savings and checking to pay off a loan.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for replying to their sister's birthday message while out to dinner with their girlfriend. The girlfriend doesn't like when he uses his phone, so she's upset the rest of the night. Also, he had to pay for dinner, thinking she would, and he's still paying off a loan by emptying his savings and checking.\n\nFirst, the main issue is using the phone during dinner. The girlfriend expressed a preference before they went out, so he should have respected that. Even if it was a birthday message from his sister, it's about considering her feelings. The argument could be that family messages are important, but the girlfriend's discomfort with phone use is a boundary he crossed.\n\nThen there's the payment issue. He assumed she'd pay, but she didn't. That's a separate issue where his assumption led to conflict. He might have a point about financial strain, but assuming someone will pay without confirming can cause problems.\n\nPutting it all together, the main wrong is using the phone despite knowing her dislike for it. The payment issue is a mistake in communication, but the phone use is the bigger factor in the argument. So, the answer is A.\n"
