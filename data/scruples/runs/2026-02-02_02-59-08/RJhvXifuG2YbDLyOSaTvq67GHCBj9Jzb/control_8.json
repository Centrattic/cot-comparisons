Afterwards she wouldn't talk to me the rest of the night.  I'm still pissed off, I can never catch a break.  I also had to pay for dinner, I assumed she was paying.  I should also add, before we went out she asked something along the lines of \"do you want to go out for a birthday dinner?\" I wouldn't have went if I knew I was paying because I just emptied my savings and checking to pay off a loan.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a birthday dinner with his girlfriend where he replied to his sister's message. His girlfriend doesn't like him using his phone during meals. After replying, she didn't talk to him the rest of the night. He's upset because he had to pay for dinner, thought she was paying, and had emptied his accounts to pay off a loan. Before going out, she asked if he wanted to go for a birthday dinner.\n\nFirst, the key points: He used his phone during dinner, which upset his girlfriend. She didn't talk to him afterward. He had to pay for dinner, which he didn't expect. He mentions he was in financial trouble.\n\nSo, the question is whether he's in the wrong. The girlfriend's dislike of phone use during meals is a boundary he crossed. Even if his sister's message was a birthday greeting, responding immediately might have been disrespectful in their shared time. Also, not clarifying payment expectations beforehand could be an issue. He assumed she would pay, but she might have thought he was. Financial stress is a factor, but that doesn't excuse breaking her boundaries. The sister's message was a minor thing compared to the girlfriend's feelings. So, he's in the wrong for using the phone and not discussing payment beforehand. Answer A.\n"
