Afterwards she wouldn't talk to me the rest of the night.  I'm still pissed off, I can never catch a break.  I also had to pay for dinner, I assumed she was paying.  I should also add, before we went out she asked something along the lines of \"do you want to go out for a birthday dinner?\" I wouldn't have went if I knew I was paying because I just emptied my savings and checking to pay off a loan.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to break this down. The person is asking if the author is in the wrong for replying to his sister's birthday message when they were out to eat with his girlfriend. The girlfriend doesn't like him using his phone when they're out, and after he replied, she didn't talk to him the rest of the night. Also, he had to pay for dinner and thought she would cover the cost, but he was in a financial tight spot.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author replied to his sister's message during dinner. The girlfriend had previously mentioned not liking phone use during meals. So, the author might have known this was a sensitive issue. Even if it was a birthday message, using the phone could be seen as disrespectful or inconsiderate towards his partner.\n\nThen, the author mentions he was still upset because he had to pay for dinner. He thought she was paying, but he was in a financial situation where he had just paid off a loan. This adds another layer of stress. But was his reaction justified? The girlfriend's silence could be because she felt disrespected by the phone use, leading to her not talking to him. The author's anger might stem from the financial burden, but maybe the root issue was the phone use.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, he used his phone despite knowing it's a pet peeve. That could have been the main trigger for the girlfriend's reaction. Even if the sister's message was a birthday greeting, there might have been a better way to handle it, like excusing himself or replying later. The financial misunderstanding is another point, but that's a separate issue. However, the phone use likely caused the immediate conflict. So, the author might be at fault for not respecting his girlfriend's boundaries, leading to the subsequent fallout. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
