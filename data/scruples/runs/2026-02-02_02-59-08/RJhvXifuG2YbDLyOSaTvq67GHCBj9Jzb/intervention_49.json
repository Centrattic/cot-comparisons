I should also add, before we went out she asked something along the lines of \"do you want to go out for a birthday dinner?\" I wouldn't have went if I knew I was paying because I just emptied my savings and checking to pay off a loan.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're at fault for replying to their sister's birthday message during a dinner with their girlfriend. The girlfriend doesn't like phone use when they're out. The user thinks they're in the wrong, but the assistant needs to decide.\n\nFirst, the main issues here are: using the phone during dinner, the girlfriend being upset afterward, and not paying for dinner as expected. The user replied to their sister, which upset the girlfriend. The girlfriend had previously mentioned not liking phone use when they're out. So, the user didn't respect her boundary, leading to her not talking to him the rest of the night. \n\nThen, there's the payment part. The user assumed the girlfriend would pay, but he ended up paying. He mentions he just emptied his savings and checking to pay off a loan, which might add context about financial strain. However, the main conflict here is about the phone use and the resulting tension.\n\nThe user is also frustrated, feeling like they can't catch a break. He was under the impression that the dinner was her idea, and he didn't know he'd have to pay. But the key point is that he used his phone, which the girlfriend had previously said she didn't like. Even if he thought replying to a birthday message was quick, it's about respecting her boundaries. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the user should have considered the girlfriend's preference before using his phone. The fact that she was upset enough to not talk to him for the rest of the night indicates that this was a significant breach of her comfort. The payment issue might be a secondary issue, but the primary problem is the phone use. \n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the user's action of replying to the sister was a breach of the girlfriend's boundaries. Since the girlfriend had stated her dislike for phone use during meals, the user is at fault for not respecting that. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
