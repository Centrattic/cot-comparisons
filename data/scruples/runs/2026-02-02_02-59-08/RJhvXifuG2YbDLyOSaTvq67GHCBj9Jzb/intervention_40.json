      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the person (34M) is out to eat with his girlfriend (33F). His sister messages him a Happy Birthday, and he replies. The girlfriend doesn't like him using his phone when they're out, and after that, she won't talk to him the rest of the night. The author is upset because he thought she was paying for dinner but ended up paying himself. Also, he mentions he just paid off a loan and had no money left.\n\nFirst, the main issue seems to be the phone use. The girlfriend explicitly said she doesn't like it when he uses his phone when they're together. So, he replied to his sister's message, which upset her. That's probably the first point. Even if the sister's message was a birthday wish, responding during the dinner might have been rude from the girlfriend's perspective. She might have felt ignored or that he was prioritizing his sister over her in that moment.\n\nThen there's the financial part. The author assumed she would pay, but he ended up paying. He's upset because he had to use his savings and checking to pay off a loan, so he's tight on cash. However, the problem here is whether he should have assumed she would pay. If they didn't discuss it beforehand and he just went ahead, that could be an issue. Maybe it's a communication problem. He should have clarified who was paying before the dinner, especially since he knew his financial situation.\n\nAlso, before going out, she asked if he wanted to go out for a birthday dinner. He agreed without knowing he'd have to pay. So maybe he should have clarified his financial situation earlier. If he was in such a tight spot, he might have communicated that to her before agreeing to go out. But maybe she expected him to know she was paying, which isn't always clear. However, since he had to pay off a loan and had no money left, it's possible he should have mentioned his financial state to her before the dinner.\n\nPutting it all together, the main issues are: 1) Using the phone against her wishes, leading to her being upset. 2) Assuming she would pay without confirming, leading to a financial strain. Both actions could be seen as the author's fault. He didn't consider her feelings about phone use and didn't communicate his expectations about paying for dinner. So, he might be in the wrong on both counts. The girlfriend's reaction might be justified if he consistently uses the phone during dinners, but maybe she overreacted. However, the author's actions did contribute to the conflict. So, probably, the answer is A (he's in the wrong).\n"
