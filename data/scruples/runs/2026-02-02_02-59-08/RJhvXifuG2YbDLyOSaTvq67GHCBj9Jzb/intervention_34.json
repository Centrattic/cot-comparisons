      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author, who's 34, and his girlfriend, 33, went out to eat on his birthday. The sister messaged him \"Happy Birthday,\" and he replied. The girlfriend doesn't like him using his phone when they're out. After that, she didn't talk to him the rest of the night. Also, the author ended up paying for dinner, expecting her to pay, but he had just paid off a loan and was out of money.\n\nFirst, the main issue is the phone use. The girlfriend specifically doesn't like when he uses his phone when they're out. So replying to his sister might have been a direct violation of her boundaries. Even if the sister's message was unexpected, the author should have considered her feelings and maybe waited until a more appropriate time to respond. The fact that the girlfriend asked if he wanted to go out for dinner first might indicate that they both agreed it was a birthday dinner, so maybe he should have checked with her before replying.\n\nThen there's the payment issue. He assumed she was paying, but she didn't. Since he had just emptied his accounts to pay off a loan, this could have been a problem. However, the assumption that the other person would pay might not be valid unless it was clearly discussed beforehand. If he didn't clarify who was paying, maybe he's partly at fault for not confirming. But if the girlfriend expected him to pay and he wasn't aware, that's on her for not setting expectations.\n\nThe girlfriend's response of not talking to him the rest of the night seems excessive, but the author's actions (using the phone) might have been the trigger. He's upset because he had to pay, but if he didn't confirm the payment plan, he shares some responsibility. \n\nOverall, the main point is about respecting the girlfriend's boundaries. If she doesn't like phone use during meals, replying to the sister was a breach. The payment issue adds to the problem but might not make the girlfriend entirely wrong. So the author is in the wrong for not respecting her preference about phone use, even if there's some gray area with the payment.\n"
