Afterwards she wouldn't talk to me the rest of the night.  I'm still pissed off, I can never catch a break.  I also had to pay for dinner, I assumed she was paying.  I should also add, before we went out she asked something along the lines of \"do you want to go out for a birthday dinner?\" I wouldn't have went if I knew I was paying because I just emptied my savings and checking to pay off a loan.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author replying to his sister's birthday message while on a dinner date with his girlfriend. The girlfriend doesn't like him using his phone during the meal, leading to her not talking to him the rest of the night. Additionally, the author ended up paying for dinner, thinking the girlfriend would cover it, and he was in a financial tight spot after paying off a loan.\n\nFirst, the main issue seems to be the phone use. The girlfriend had previously expressed disapproval about phone use during their time together. The author's response to his sister's message might have been seen as disrespectful or inconsiderate, especially during a dinner date. Even though it was a birthday message, using the phone could have been perceived as prioritizing the sister over the girlfriend's comfort. Communication here is key. The author might have known the girlfriend's feelings about phone use but chose to reply anyway, which could be seen as dismissive of her boundaries.\n\nThen there's the financial aspect. The author assumed the girlfriend was paying, but she ended up paying. He mentions he had to pay off a loan, which might explain his frustration. However, assuming someone else will pay without confirmation can lead to misunderstandings. It's important to clarify expectations beforehand to avoid such situations.\n\nPutting it all together, the author's actions on both the phone use and financial assumption contributed to the girlfriend's upset. While the sister's message was a birthday greeting, the context of the date and the girlfriend's established boundaries about phone use place the responsibility on the author to respect those boundaries. The financial part adds to the tension but might be a separate issue. Overall, the author's actions likely hurt the girlfriend's feelings and led to the conflict, making him at least partially responsible.\n"
