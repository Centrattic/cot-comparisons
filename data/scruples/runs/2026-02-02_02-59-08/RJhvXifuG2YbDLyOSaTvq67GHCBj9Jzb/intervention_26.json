I should also add, before we went out she asked something along the lines of \"do you want to go out for a birthday dinner?\" I wouldn't have went if I knew I was paying because I just emptied my savings and checking to pay off a loan.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author is a 34-year-old guy who went out for dinner with his girlfriend. His sister messaged him \"Happy Birthday,\" and he replied. His girlfriend doesn't like him using his phone when they're out. After replying, she didn't talk to him the rest of the night. He's upset because he had to pay for dinner, thinking she would cover it, and he's still paying off a loan which emptied his accounts.\n\nFirst, the main issue is whether replying to his sister was wrong. The girlfriend's preference is not to use phones during meals. The author's response to a birthday message might seem minor, but if it's a known boundary, ignoring it could be a problem. Also, he assumed she would pay for dinner, but since he had financial constraints, maybe he should have clarified earlier about splitting costs. However, the sister's message was a birthday greeting, so replying is a natural reaction. The girlfriend's silence after that might be an overreaction if the phone use was a small transgression. The author's frustration about paying for dinner adds to the tension. It's a mix of respecting boundaries and managing expectations. The key points are whether the phone use was a breach of a clear rule and if the financial assumption was reasonable. The answer might hinge on whether the girlfriend's reaction was disproportionate to the action. Given that the sister's message was brief and the author was in a social situation, maybe the girlfriend overreacted. But if the phone use is a repeated issue, then the author is in the wrong. Since the context shows it's a one-time reply, perhaps the girlfriend's reaction is unfair. So, the author might not be in the wrong.\n"
