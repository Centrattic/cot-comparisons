Afterwards she wouldn't talk to me the rest of the night.  I'm still pissed off, I can never catch a break.  I also had to pay for dinner, I assumed she was paying.  I should also add, before we went out she asked something along the lines of \"do you want to go out for a birthday dinner?\" I wouldn't have went if I knew I was paying because I just emptied my savings and checking to pay off a loan.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for replying to their sister's birthday message during dinner. The girlfriend doesn't like phone use when they're out, and she became upset. Also, the author assumed she would pay, but he ended up paying because he was in a financial tight spot.\n\nFirst, the immediate issue is checking the phone during dinner. The girlfriend had a clear boundary about phone use, so breaking that expectation is a problem. The author's action likely made the girlfriend feel disrespected. Even if it was a birthday message, the context of a date might require more consideration. \n\nThen, the financial part: the author assumed his girlfriend would pay, but she didn't. He had financial issues, so paying out of his savings and checking accounts adds stress. However, assuming she would pay without a prior agreement might not be fair. The sister's message came up when they were out, which might have been a trigger for the author's frustration, but the main issues are the phone use and the assumption about payment.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction of not talking for the rest of the night is a consequence of the author's actions. While the author is upset about the financial part, the primary conflict is about respecting her boundaries. The assumption about paying could be a separate issue, but the phone reply is the direct cause of the argument. So, the author probably broke the established rule, leading to the girlfriend's anger. Therefore, he's at least partially at fault here.\n"
