Afterwards she wouldn't talk to me the rest of the night.  I'm still pissed off, I can never catch a break.  I also had to pay for dinner, I assumed she was paying.  I should also add, before we went out she asked something along the lines of \"do you want to go out for a birthday dinner?\" I wouldn't have went if I knew I was paying because I just emptied my savings and checking to pay off a loan.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for replying to their sister's birthday message during a dinner with their girlfriend. The girlfriend doesn't like phone use during meals, and she was upset after. Also, he had to pay for dinner, which he didn't expect, and he's still paying off a loan.\n\nFirst, the main issue here seems to be using the phone during dinner. The girlfriend already mentioned she doesn't like it when he uses his phone when they're out. So, even if the message was a birthday wish from a sister, the act of replying might have been a breach of the unspoken rule they both agreed on. That could be where he went wrong. But then again, maybe the sister's message was unexpected, and he just wanted to respond politely.\n\nAnother point is the payment. The user thought the girlfriend would pay, but she ended up not wanting to, so he had to cover it. That's a separate issue, but maybe it adds to the tension. However, the main question is whether replying to the message was the wrong move. \n\nConsidering social norms, it's generally expected to be present with your partner during dates or dinners, so checking messages might come off as disrespectful. Even if it's a family member, the girlfriend's preference should be respected. Also, the user's frustration about the payment and financial situation is understandable, but that's not directly related to the phone use.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author probably is in the wrong for replying to the message, leading to the girlfriend's upset. The answer would be A.\n"
