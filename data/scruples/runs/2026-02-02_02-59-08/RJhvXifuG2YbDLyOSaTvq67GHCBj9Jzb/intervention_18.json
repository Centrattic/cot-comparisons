Afterwards she wouldn't talk to me the rest of the night.  I'm still pissed off, I can never catch a break.  I also had to pay for dinner, I assumed she was paying.  I should also add, before we went out she asked something along the lines of \"do you want to go out for a birthday dinner?\" I wouldn't have went if I knew I was paying because I just emptied my savings and checking to pay off a loan.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author is a 34-year-old man who got a birthday message from his sister while he was out to eat with his girlfriend. He replied to her message, which upset his girlfriend because she doesn't like when he uses his phone during their time together. She then stopped talking to him the rest of the night. Additionally, he had to pay for dinner, thinking she would cover her own part, but he had just paid off a loan and was short on cash.\n\nFirst, the main issue here is the phone use. The girlfriend had previously expressed that she doesn't like when he uses his phone during their time together. So, by replying to his sister, he's going against her wishes. That's a clear boundary he crossed. Even if it was a birthday message, the girlfriend's comfort and the quality time they're spending should take priority. The fact that she stopped talking to him afterward shows how hurt she was by his actions.\n\nThen there's the dinner payment. The author assumed his girlfriend would pay for herself, but he ended up paying because he was broke. This adds to the tension. Miscommunication about splitting the bill can lead to resentment, especially when one person is financially strained. He didn't clarify the payment arrangement beforehand, which might have been a mistake. She might have expected him to mention his financial situation before agreeing to go out, or he could have brought up the payment method to avoid the awkwardness later.\n\nPutting this together, the author's actions\u2014ignoring his girlfriend's preference about phone use and not addressing the payment plan upfront\u2014contributed to her upset. Even if he had a legitimate reason for replying (like family), respecting her boundaries is crucial in a relationship. The financial part adds to the conflict but isn't the main issue here. The main wrong was not respecting her wishes about the phone use. So, the answer is A, he's in the wrong.\n"
