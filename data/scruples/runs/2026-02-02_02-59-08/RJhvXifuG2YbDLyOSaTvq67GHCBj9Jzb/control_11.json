I should also add, before we went out she asked something along the lines of \"do you want to go out for a birthday dinner?\" I wouldn't have went if I knew I was paying because I just emptied my savings and checking to pay off a loan.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for replying to his sister's birthday message while they were out to eat with his girlfriend. The sister doesn't like him using his phone in public, and after he did, she was silent for the rest of the night. Also, he ended up paying for dinner, which he didn't expect because he had just paid off a loan and was short on cash.\n\nFirst, the main issue is the phone use. The sister has expressed that she doesn't like him using his phone when they're out. He replied to her birthday message, which might have been a short reply, but the sister took it badly. The girlfriend's reaction could be because she felt disrespected or that he wasn't giving her his full attention. That's a common point of contention in relationships. So, from her perspective, he might have been inconsiderate by prioritizing a message from his sister over their time together. That could be on him.\n\nThen there's the issue of paying for dinner. The sister asked if he wanted to go out for a birthday dinner, and he assumed she would pay. But she ended up not paying, and he had to cover the cost, which was a financial strain. If he assumed she would pay based on the way she asked, maybe there was a misunderstanding. However, in some cultures or personal habits, people might expect to split or alternate who pays unless specified. If he didn't clarify, he might have overestimated her generosity. But if she phrased it as an invitation where payment was expected from him, that's different. The ambiguity here is tricky. \n\nSo, putting it together: The phone use is a breach of the girlfriend's preferences, which he should respect. Even if the message was a birthday wish, she might have felt neglected. As for paying, if he didn't confirm who pays and ended up in a situation where he couldn't afford it, maybe there's some fault in not communicating financial expectations. But the main issue is probably the phone use. The girlfriend's reaction is about feeling disrespected, which is a valid reason for her to be upset. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting her boundaries.\n"
