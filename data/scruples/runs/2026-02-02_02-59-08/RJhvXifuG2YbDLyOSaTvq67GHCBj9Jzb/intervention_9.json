      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who posted the situation is at fault. The situation is about replying to a sister's birthday message while out to eat with their girlfriend. The sister doesn't like the guy using his phone during their date. Then, the girlfriend gets upset and doesn't talk to him the rest of the night. Also, he had to pay for dinner, thinking she would cover it. He mentioned he just used his savings and checking to pay off a loan, so he's tight on money now.\n\nFirst, the main issue is the phone use. The sister (girlfriend) has a rule about not using phones when they're out. The author responded to a birthday message, which might have broken that rule. Even if it was a simple \"Happy Birthday\" reply, it could be seen as a breach of her boundary. People often have different tolerance levels for phone usage in relationships, and if she specifically doesn't want him to use his phone during their time together, ignoring that could be a mistake.\n\nThen there's the issue of splitting the bill. The user assumed the girlfriend would pay, but she ended up charging him. That's a common source of conflict. If he was under the impression she would pay but didn't confirm, that's on him. Even if he's in a tight financial spot, assuming someone else will cover the cost without discussing it can lead to resentment. It's important to communicate payment arrangements beforehand to avoid misunderstandings.\n\nAdditionally, the sister (girlfriend) asked if he wanted to go out for dinner. He agreed without knowing he had to pay. If she asked, maybe he should have mentioned his financial situation. But the main point is that he didn't clarify who would pay, leading to an unexpected expense. He might feel wronged because he assumed, but assumptions are risky. The girlfriend might have felt he was taking her for granted by assuming she'd pay, especially if she had her own expectations.\n\nPutting it all together, the user did two things: used his phone against her wishes and didn't clarify payment. Both actions contributed to the girlfriend's upset. The phone use directly violated her boundary, which could be a significant issue. The payment issue is another point where clear communication was lacking. So, in both cases, he's partially at fault for not respecting her preferences and not setting expectations about money. Therefore, he's in the wrong for these actions.\n"
