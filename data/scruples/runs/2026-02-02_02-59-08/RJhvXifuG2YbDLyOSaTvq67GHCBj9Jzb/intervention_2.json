Afterwards she wouldn't talk to me the rest of the night.  I'm still pissed off, I can never catch a break.  I also had to pay for dinner, I assumed she was paying.  I should also add, before we went out she asked something along the lines of \"do you want to go out for a birthday dinner?\" I wouldn't have went if I knew I was paying because I just emptied my savings and checking to pay off a loan.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for replying to his sister's birthday message while on a date with his girlfriend. The girlfriend doesn't like him using his phone during dinners. He also ended up paying for dinner, which he didn't expect because his savings were just used to pay off a loan.\n\nFirst, the main issue is the phone use. The girlfriend has made it clear she's not a fan of him using his phone when they're out. The author replied to his sister, which upset her enough that she stopped talking to him for the rest of the night. That's a significant reaction, and it seems like the author didn't consider her feelings here. Even though it was a birthday message, using the phone in a public setting where the GF is uncomfortable with it could be seen as disrespectful to her preferences.\n\nThen there's the issue of splitting the bill. The author assumed the GF would pay, but he ended up paying. He had just emptied his savings, which adds to his frustration. However, it's a common courtesy to split the bill unless otherwise specified. If the GF expected him to pay, maybe she should have mentioned it, but the author might have made an incorrect assumption. Still, not talking to him the rest of the night over the phone use seems harsh, but the phone issue is the bigger problem here.\n\nThe author is upset that he's \"never catching a break,\" but his actions (using the phone) directly caused the GF's upset. The GF's reaction is valid because boundaries were set, and they were ignored. The payment issue could be a separate point, but the main conflict stems from the phone use. So, the author is in the wrong for not respecting his GF's preference about phone use during their dinner. He should have either explained the situation beforehand or found a way to handle the message without disrupting their time together.\n"
