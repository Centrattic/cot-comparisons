I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author did the right thing by telling their sister's boyfriend about the sister's past abuse. The sister had a history with an abusive ex who was a pimp, and the author believes the boyfriend didn't know about this. The author thought it was wrong for the sister to hide this from her current partner, so they revealed the information directly to him. The boyfriend reacted angrily, and the sister cut off the author.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications of the author's actions. Telling someone else's private information without their consent is generally considered a breach of privacy. The sister might have chosen not to disclose her past for various reasons\u2014maybe she wasn't ready, felt it was personal, or trusted her boyfriend enough to share it herself. The author's intention was to protect the boyfriend from potential harm, assuming he didn't know the truth. However, the author didn't check with the sister first or ask her how she wanted to handle it. \n\nOn one hand, the author's concern is valid. Hiding a past abusive relationship could affect the current relationship, especially since they're considering marriage. The boyfriend has a right to know such significant information. On the other hand, the sister might have her own reasons for not sharing, and the author's method of disclosure\u2014without her knowledge\u2014could be seen as overstepping. The author assumed the role of the sister's advocate, possibly without her consent, leading to her cutting off the author. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction was harsh, but it's possible he felt betrayed by the sister, even if the author's intent was good. The author didn't give the sister a chance to explain or handle the situation herself. This could be seen as a violation of trust between siblings. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the line here is thin. While the information was important, the method of disclosure was problematic. The author didn't respect the sister's autonomy to decide when and how to share her story. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not considering the sister's wishes and boundaries, even if the intention was to protect the boyfriend.\n"
