I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their sister's boyfriend about their sister's past trauma. \n\nFirst, the sister was in an abusive relationship where she was pimped out. The author thinks hiding this from the boyfriend is a problem. The parents weren't sure if the boyfriend knew, so the author decided to tell him. The boyfriend reacted badly, and the sister then cut off the author.\n\nNow, considering the ethics. The sister's past is a sensitive topic. The author's intention was to protect their sister's future partner by sharing important information. But did they have the right to do that? The sister might have chosen not to share that information for her own reasons, maybe to protect herself, rebuild trust, or other personal motives. The author's action might have violated her privacy and autonomy. \n\nHowever, the author's concern is valid. The boyfriend being in the dark about such a significant aspect of his partner's life could affect their relationship. But the way the information was delivered\u2014without the sister's consent\u2014could be problematic. The boyfriend's negative reaction might not have been about the information itself but how it was presented or his own feelings about it. \n\nAlso, the sister cutting off the author is a strong reaction, but maybe she felt her privacy was invaded. The author's request for an apology might not consider the boyfriend's right to process the information and the sister's right to choose what to share.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author might be in the wrong because they overstepped by disclosing private information without consent. Even if the intention was good, the method was intrusive. However, there's also the argument that the information was important for the boyfriend to know. But the decision to share such personal details should rest with the sister, not the sibling. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the answer tilts towards the author being in the wrong (A) because they shared private information without consent, even if their intention was to help. The sister's autonomy and right to privacy are key here.\n"
