I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author told their sister's boyfriend about the sister's past abusive relationship. The sister had a history of being in an abusive situation where she claims she had little agency, maybe even being pimped out. The author thought the boyfriend should know this because it's a major thing that could affect their relationship. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the sister's right to privacy. The sister hasn't told her boyfriend about her past. The author is stepping in and sharing that information without the sister's consent. That's a big deal because personal history, especially something as traumatic as abuse, is sensitive. Even if the author is concerned, sharing it without permission might be overstepping.\n\nThen there's the sister's agency. The author isn't sure if the sister is telling the truth about her lack of agency. But the sister did say it was her history, so maybe she's claiming it's part of her past. The author's parents were also unsure if the boyfriend knew, which adds to the uncertainty. The author's intention was to protect the boyfriend from not knowing something important. But is that the right approach?\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction was aggressive\u2014he yelled and threw the author out. The author then asked for an apology from the boyfriend, leading the sister to cut off the author. The question is whether the author had the right to intervene like that.\n\nI think the key points here are consent and the right to privacy. The author didn't check with the sister if it's okay to share her past. Even with good intentions, sharing someone else's personal trauma without their permission can be harmful. The sister might feel betrayed, which explains why she's angry and cut the author off. The boyfriend's reaction is also valid because he might have felt blindsided, but that doesn't justify his behavior.\n\nThe author might have been trying to be helpful, but the method was problematic. The right approach would have been to talk to the sister first, encourage her to share her history with her boyfriend herself, rather than doing it without consent. The author overstepped their boundaries, even if their intentions were to protect the boyfriend.\n"
