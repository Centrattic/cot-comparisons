I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" scenario is in the wrong. The author told their sister's boyfriend about her past with an abusive ex, which led to the boyfriend yelling and the sister cutting off the author. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but they want my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The sister was in an abusive relationship where she was a victim of abuse and exploitation. The author believes the sister might be downplaying her agency in that situation. The parents also didn't know if the current boyfriend was aware of this history. The author decided to tell the boyfriend, which led to conflict.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether the author had the right to disclose this personal information without the sister's consent. Even if the author's intentions were to protect the boyfriend or the sister, sharing such sensitive information without permission is a breach of trust. The sister's right to privacy and autonomy is important here. The author might have thought they were doing the right thing, but without consent, it's a violation of her privacy. \n\nAdditionally, the sister's reaction (cutting off the author) shows the impact of this disclosure. The boyfriend's anger could be due to being blindsided, but the author's action still crossed a line. Even if there's concern about the sister's well-being, the approach was misguided. The author should have discussed this with the sister first, not gone straight to the boyfriend. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author acted without considering the sister's boundaries and privacy, which makes them the asshole in this situation. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
