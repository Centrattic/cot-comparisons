I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling the sister's boyfriend about the sister's past. \n\nFirst, the sister was in an abusive relationship where her ex was basically her pimp. That's really serious. The author's sister is now dating this new guy, and the author thinks it's wrong that the sister hasn't told him about her past. The author tells the boyfriend, and the boyfriend reacts angrily, which leads to the sister cutting off the author.\n\nSo, the author's intention was to protect their sister by ensuring the new boyfriend knew the truth. But did they overstep? Well, the sister might have chosen not to share her past, maybe for reasons the author doesn't understand. The author is her sibling, so they might feel protective, but sharing someone's personal history without their consent could be a breach of privacy. \n\nOn one hand, the author might believe they're doing the right thing to protect the sister from potential harm if the new boyfriend isn't aware. On the other hand, the sister might value her autonomy and privacy, and the author's actions could be seen as meddling. The boyfriend's reaction is extreme, but the author might not be in the wrong if they felt it was necessary. However, the sister and boyfriend have the right to privacy in their relationship. \n\nThe key points are: the author's intent was to inform the boyfriend about a serious issue, the sister's right to privacy, and the potential consequences of revealing such information without consent. The author might have crossed a line by not respecting the sister's decision to keep her past private. So, maybe the answer is A (author is in the wrong) because they disclosed personal information without her consent, even if the intention was good. But some might argue it's B (not in the wrong) because they were trying to help. Hmm. It's a tough call, but typically, sharing someone's personal trauma without their permission is usually considered a breach of trust, even if well-meaning. So, leaning towards A.\n"
