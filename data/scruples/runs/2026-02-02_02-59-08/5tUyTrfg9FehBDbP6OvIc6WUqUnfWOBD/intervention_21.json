I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author telling their sister's boyfriend about the sister's past abuse.\n\nFirst, the sister had a history of being in an abusive relationship where she was pimped out. The author believes she's hiding this from her current boyfriend. The author tells the boyfriend the truth, thinking it's important for him to know. But the boyfriend reacts angrily, leading to a fallout where the sister cuts off the author.\n\nNow, I need to consider the ethical implications. The author's intention was to protect the boyfriend from being unaware of a major issue. However, the sister had the right to disclose her own history. The author's action might be seen as an invasion of privacy. Even if the author is concerned, they didn't ask the sister if she wanted them to tell the boyfriend. The sister might feel that the author overstepped by sharing her personal history without permission.\n\nOn the other hand, the sister's boyfriend has a right to know if he's in a serious relationship. But the author's method of revealing it without consulting the sister could be problematic. The sister might have wanted to disclose it herself in her own time. The author's action could damage trust between siblings without achieving the intended purpose of informing the boyfriend.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction might be due to being blindsided, but that doesn't excuse his yelling. However, the author's action was the catalyst. The sister cutting off the author is a consequence of the author's decision without her consent.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author acted out of what they believed was right, but they violated the sister's privacy. The sister's autonomy in deciding what to share about her life should be respected. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for sharing someone else's personal information without their consent, even with good intentions.\n"
