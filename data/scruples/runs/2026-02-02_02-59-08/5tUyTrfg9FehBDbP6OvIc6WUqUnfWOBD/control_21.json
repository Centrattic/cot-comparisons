I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who shared the story is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the sister's boyfriend was abusive in a previous relationship. The author is concerned because their sister is considering marriage with someone who might not know this. The parents didn't know if the boyfriend was aware of the past abuse. So the author decides to tell the boyfriend the truth. The boyfriend reacts angrily, and the sister cuts off the author.\n\nNow, the key points here are the duty to protect the sister from potential harm. The author's sister was a victim of abuse and pimping, which is a serious issue. If the current boyfriend didn't know, the author might feel a responsibility to inform him to prevent further harm. However, the sister might see this as an invasion of her privacy or overstepping.\n\nThe author's intention was to protect their sister, but the method involved telling the boyfriend without her consent. That's a big ethical consideration. Even if the intention was good, the action of disclosing private information without permission can be problematic. It's about respecting boundaries versus protecting someone from potential harm.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction is extreme, but maybe he's in shock or doesn't handle conflict well. The sister cutting off the author is a consequence of the action. The author now feels rejected and wonders if they did the right thing.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a tough call. The author might be in the right if protecting the sister from a potentially harmful situation is the priority. But they might be in the wrong for violating the sister's confidentiality. It depends on the context of their relationship and what the sister's capacity was to consent or know the truth.\n\nBut generally, intervening in someone else's relationship without their consent can be seen as overstepping. So the answer might be A, the author is in the wrong. However, if the sister was clearly in danger and the author had valid concerns, then maybe B. But the situation is complex. The author's action led to a breakdown in the family, but the sister might need that intervention. However, the method was questionable. So leaning towards A.\n"
