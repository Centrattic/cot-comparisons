I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author did the right thing by telling the sister's boyfriend about the abuse. Let's start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe author's sister was in an abusive relationship where her ex-boyfriend was a pimp. She's now serious with a new boyfriend, and the author is concerned because the sister hasn't told him about her past. The parents also seemed unsure if the new boyfriend knew. The author went to the boyfriend's place and told him directly, leading to a confrontation where the boyfriend yelled and threw them out. Then the sister cut off the author.\n\nFirst, I should consider the sister's privacy. The author might have thought they were protecting their sister by being honest, but did they have the right to disclose such personal information without the sister's consent? Even if the sister's history is serious, sharing it without permission could be seen as a violation of trust.\n\nThen there's the question of the author's intention. They mentioned doubting the sister's account of her lack of agency. Maybe they were trying to protect their sister from someone who might not stay with her if he knew the truth. However, it's not the author's place to make that judgment or act on it without the sister's input.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction was negative, but does that mean the author was wrong to tell him? Well, if the sister didn't share her history, the author's disclosure could be seen as a breach of confidentiality. The sister might feel betrayed by her sibling, leading to the fallout in their relationship.\n\nAlso, the author's approach was direct and confrontational. Maybe they should have first spoken to the sister to understand her perspective better before involving the boyfriend. Approaching the boyfriend without knowing if he was already aware could have been unwise, especially if the sister had chosen not to disclose it for her own reasons.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's concern is valid. The sister's past is a significant factor in a serious relationship. But the method of disclosure was problematic. The author didn't consider the sister's boundaries or the potential consequences of their actions. In such cases, the right to privacy often outweighs the desire to protect someone from a potentially harmful relationship without the person's consent.\n\nSo, weighing all these factors, the author might be in the wrong for breaching their sister's confidentiality and not handling the situation more carefully. The sister's autonomy and her choice to disclose her history on her own terms are important. The author's actions led to a loss of family relationship without necessarily achieving the intended protection for the sister.\n"
