I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who told their sister's boyfriend about the sister's abusive past is in the wrong. \n\nFirst, the sister was in an abusive relationship where she was pimped out. The author's parents didn't know if the new boyfriend was aware of this. The author thought it was wrong to keep it a secret and decided to tell the boyfriend directly. The boyfriend reacted angrily, and the sister cut off the author.\n\nNow, considering the sister's history, the author's intention was to protect the new boyfriend from being unaware of the sister's past. But the sister might have had her reasons for not disclosing that information to her boyfriend. The author might have overstepped by not consulting the sister first. Even if the author believed the sister's account, the act of revealing personal information without consent could be seen as an invasion of privacy. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might have felt a moral obligation to prevent potential harm if the boyfriend wasn't aware. However, the appropriate step would have been to talk to the sister first, not bypass her and go directly to the boyfriend. The reaction from the boyfriend and the sister's subsequent cutting off suggests that the author's approach was hurtful and perhaps not the right way to handle the situation. \n\nSo, the key points are: breach of trust by not getting the sister's consent, potential overstepping in judgment about what the boyfriend should know, and the resulting damage to the author's relationship with the sister. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong.\n"
