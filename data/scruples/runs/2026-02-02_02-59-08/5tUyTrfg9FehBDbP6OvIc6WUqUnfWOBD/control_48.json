I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author told their sister's boyfriend about the sister's past abusive relationship. The sister had a history where her ex-boyfriend abused her and was like her pimp. The author mentioned this to their parents, and then later found out that maybe the boyfriend didn't know. So, the author decided to go to the boyfriend's apartment and tell him the truth.\n\nHmm, the first thing I'm thinking is about consent and privacy. The sister might have told the boyfriend some things, but not all. The author is stepping in and sharing information that isn't their own to share. Even if the author's intention was to protect the boyfriend, by revealing the sister's past without her permission, that's a big deal. The sister might have her reasons for not disclosing that information, maybe she wasn't ready, maybe she felt ashamed, or maybe she thought it was in the past. The author is overstepping by taking that decision away from her.\n\nThen there's the reaction of the boyfriend. He got angry and threw the author out, which might be because he was shocked or felt betrayed. The author then demands an apology from the boyfriend. But the sister then cuts off the author. The author's actions led to the boyfriend being upset and the sister being upset. \n\nBut wait, the author's reasoning is that it's wrong to be in a serious relationship without the partner knowing about such a major past. That's a valid ethical concern. However, the way the author handled it was problematic. They didn't talk to the sister first to understand her perspective or get her consent to share the information. They acted on their own judgment, which could be seen as violating the sister's privacy and autonomy.\n\nSo, even if the author's intent was good\u2014to protect the boyfriend from being in a relationship with someone who has a hidden, traumatic past\u2014the method of disclosure was without the sister's consent. The right approach would have been to have a conversation with the sister about her relationship and let her decide what to share with her partner. The author didn't do that, so they took a big step without her permission, which is a breach of trust. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong.\n"
