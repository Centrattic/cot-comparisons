I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who told their sister's boyfriend about the sister's past is in the wrong. \n\nFirst, the sister had a history of abuse and being pimped by a former partner. The author felt that the current boyfriend should know this because it's a major issue that might affect their relationship. The parents were unsure if the boyfriend knew, so the author decided to inform him directly. The boyfriend reacted angrily, leading to a fallout where the sister cut off the author.\n\nI need to consider confidentiality. The sister might have shared her past with her family, but does the author have the right to disclose that information to the boyfriend without her consent? Even if the author's intention was to protect the sister or the boyfriend, sharing such personal details without permission could breach trust. The sister's decision to keep her history private might be her choice, and the author overstepped by revealing it. \n\nHowever, there's also the aspect of the sister potentially being in another harmful situation. If the author genuinely believed the sister's current partner was unaware and might be at risk, there's an argument for the author's concern. But even then, the proper approach might be to talk to the sister first, not go directly to the boyfriend. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction was hostile, but that doesn't necessarily justify the author's actions. The key issue is consent: did the author have the right to share the sister's private information? Since the sister hadn't told the boyfriend, the author's disclosure could be seen as violating her privacy. The sister then cutting off the author is a consequence, but the initial action of the author was a breach of trust. \n\nSo weighing these factors, the author is likely in the wrong because they disclosed confidential information without the sister's consent, even if their motives were to help. The answer should be A.\n"
