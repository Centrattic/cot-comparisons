I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author told their sister's boyfriend about the sister's past abuse and being pimped out. The sister had been in a relationship where she was abused, then she came back to live with her parents. The author comments to the parents that it's good the boyfriend is with her knowing her history. The parents are unsure if the boyfriend knows. The author thinks it's wrong to hide such a major issue and decides to tell the boyfriend directly. The boyfriend reacts angrily, yells, and throws the author out. Then the author asks the sister for an apology from the boyfriend, and the sister cuts them off.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. The sister's past is a very sensitive and personal matter. The author's intention was to be honest and think the boyfriend should know, but maybe they overstepped. The sister might not have wanted the boyfriend to know, or she might not have felt ready to share that with him. By disclosing without the sister's consent, the author violated her privacy. Even if the author thought it was the right thing, the sister's autonomy is important here. The boyfriend's reaction could be due to being surprised, but the author didn't have the sister's permission to share this information. The sister's response of cutting off the author is extreme, but the author's action might have been a breach of trust. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might feel that the boyfriend needed to know to make an informed decision. But in relationships, such sensitive information is typically shared by the individual themselves, not by a family member. The author's approach was direct and without consent, which can be seen as meddling. So, the author's action could be considered wrong because they didn't respect the sister's privacy and her right to disclose her own history. Therefore, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
