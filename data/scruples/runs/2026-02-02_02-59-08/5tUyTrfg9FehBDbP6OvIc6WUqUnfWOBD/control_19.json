I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe author's sister is in a serious relationship with a guy they think is planning to marry her. The sister had a bad past with an ex who abused her and was a pimp. The author told their parents that they think it's good the current boyfriend is with her despite her history. The parents, however, weren't sure if the boyfriend knew about the past. The author then took it upon themselves to tell the boyfriend the truth, which led to the boyfriend yelling and throwing them out. The sister then cut off the author.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author had the right to share this information. The sister might have kept her past a secret, so the author is stepping in to protect the boyfriend from being in a relationship with someone who has a traumatic history. But is the author overstepping?\n\nThere's a line between helping someone and violating privacy. The sister might have chosen not to disclose her past for a reason. Maybe she's working on healing, or maybe she's afraid of judgment. The author's actions bypassed the sister's autonomy to decide what to share with her partner. Even if the author thinks it's in the boyfriend's best interest, it's the sister's decision to make.\n\nAlso, the author's parents were unsure if the boyfriend knew, which adds to the uncertainty. The author assumed the boyfriend didn't know and took it upon themselves to inform him. The reaction of the boyfriend was harsh, but that might be because he was taken aback, not because he's guilty of something. \n\nThe sister cutting off the author is a strong reaction, but maybe she feels her privacy was invaded. The author's motivation might be concern, but the method was problematic. The right approach might have been to talk to the sister first, express concerns, and let her decide whether to tell the boyfriend. \n\nIn terms of ethics, there's a principle about not disclosing others' private information without their consent unless there's an imminent risk of harm. The author's sister's past is sensitive, and unless the boyfriend was in danger, the author might be breaching confidentiality. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author might be in the wrong for disclosing personal information without the sister's permission. The sister has the right to control what information is shared about her life, even if the author thinks it's for a good reason.\n"
