I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author told their sister's boyfriend about the sister's past abuse and pimping. The parents mentioned that the boyfriend might not know, and the author felt it was wrong for the sister to hide this. The boyfriend reacted angrily, and now the sister is cutting off the author.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics of sharing someone's personal information. The author is a family member, but they shared something very sensitive without the sister's consent. The sister had been keeping this part of her history private, and the author decided to disclose it because they thought it was important for the boyfriend to know. But is that their place to decide?\n\nThere's the aspect of consent. The sister might have chosen to keep her past a secret for various reasons\u2014maybe she felt it was personal, maybe she was still working through the trauma, or perhaps she didn't want the boyfriend to know for fear of rejection. The author's action bypassed the sister's autonomy in deciding what to share. Even if the author's intentions were good (thinking the boyfriend should know for his own knowledge and to make an informed decision), the sister's right to control her own narrative is important.\n\nThen there's the relationship dynamics. The author is the sister's sibling, but that doesn't automatically give them the right to share private information. Family can have conflicts of interest, and the author's judgment about the sister's agency in the past situation might not be entirely accurate. They mentioned being unsure if the sister had as little agency as she claims, but that's an assumption. Maybe the sister had valid reasons for not wanting to share past details with her current partner.\n\nAlso, the way the information was shared could be an issue. Approaching the boyfriend directly without discussing it with the sister first might have been a breach of trust. Even if the author thought it was necessary, doing so without involving the sister could have caused more harm than good. The sister's reaction cutting off the author might be a consequence of feeling betrayed.\n\nAnother angle is the boyfriend's reaction. He yelled and threw the author out, which is a strong response. But that doesn't necessarily mean he's wrong. If he found out through someone else instead of the sister, that could add to his frustration. The author's method of disclosure might have been confrontational or not sensitive enough, leading to a negative reaction.\n\nIn terms of the author's responsibility, they might have acted out of concern but overstepped by not respecting the sister's privacy. The sister's choice to keep her past private is her own, and the author's decision to share it could be seen as a violation of that privacy, regardless of intent.\n\nSo, considering all these factors: the lack of consent, the potential breach of trust, and the overstepping of boundaries, the author might be in the wrong. However, there's also the aspect of wanting to protect someone from a potentially harmful situation. But the key here is that the sister's privacy and autonomy should take precedence unless there's an immediate danger, which isn't indicated here.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong (A) because they shared sensitive information without consent and overstepped their bounds.\n"
