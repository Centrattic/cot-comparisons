I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe author's sister has been in a relationship for over a year with a boyfriend who's serious about marriage. The sister was previously in an abusive relationship where her ex was like a pimp. The author mentioned to parents that it's good the guy is with her knowing her history. Parents then expressed doubt about whether the boyfriend knew. The author then decided to go to the boyfriend's apartment and tell him the truth about the sister's past. The boyfriend reacted angrily, yelling and throwing them out. The author then asked for an apology from the boyfriend, which led the sister to cut off the author.\n\nThe key points here are: the author's intention was to inform the boyfriend of the sister's traumatic past, believing that the boyfriend should know if he was considering marriage. However, the sister had not disclosed this to her current partner. The author's action was to share this information without the sister's consent. \n\nNow, considering ethics and boundaries. The author's action could be seen as a violation of privacy. The sister might have chosen not to share her history for personal reasons, maybe she wasn't ready, or maybe she felt it was her story to tell. By sharing it, the author overstepped, possibly causing harm to both the sister and the relationship. The boyfriend's anger could be due to feeling betrayed or blindsided. The sister then cuts off the author as a result of this breach of trust.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might argue that the boyfriend deserved to know about a major aspect of his partner's past, especially if he was planning to marry her. However, the right to privacy is significant here. Even if the author had good intentions, disclosing someone's personal trauma without their permission is generally considered a violation of trust. The author didn't consider the sister's autonomy in deciding when and how to share her history.\n\nAdditionally, the sister's history with abuse is sensitive. The author's judgment about her agency in that situation might not be fully informed. It's possible the sister is still healing and didn't want to relive those experiences by telling her new partner. The author's assumption that the boyfriend should know could be well-meaning but misguided.\n\nIn terms of consequences, the boyfriend's reaction was hostile, which might indicate he was unprepared for this information. The sister's response was cutting off the author, which shows the breach of trust was significant. The author's action led to a breakdown in family relations, which is a major consequence.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author's action was a breach of privacy and trust, even if done with intentions to protect the boyfriend. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong.\n"
