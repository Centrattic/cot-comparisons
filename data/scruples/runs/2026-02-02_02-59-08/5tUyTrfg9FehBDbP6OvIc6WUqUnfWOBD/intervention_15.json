I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their sister's boyfriend about her past abuse. The author's sister was in an abusive relationship where she was pimped out by an ex. The author overheard the parents mention uncertainty about the boyfriend knowing this, so the author decided to inform the boyfriend directly. The boyfriend reacted angrily, and the sister cut off the author.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. The author's intention was to protect the sister's new boyfriend, believing that the sister wasn't being honest about her past. However, the author didn't consult the sister first, which is a major point. The sister's autonomy and right to disclose her own history are important. By revealing this without her consent, the author might have violated her privacy.\n\nAdditionally, there's the aspect of trust between siblings. The sister might feel betrayed by the author's actions. Even if the author thought it was for the boyfriend's benefit, the method was questionable. The boyfriend's reaction could be due to surprise, anger at being kept in the dark, or feeling manipulated. But the author's approach was direct and not discussed with the sister, which complicates things.\n\nAnother angle is whether the author had the right to assume the sister wasn't honest. The author mentions doubting the sister's agency in the previous situation. However, that's the author's judgment, and the sister might have her own reasons for not disclosing. The author's action bypasses the sister's right to control her narrative.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author might have a point in wanting the boyfriend to know, but the way it was done was problematic. The right approach would be to talk to the sister first, support her in disclosing the information herself if she chooses to. By going behind her back, the author undermined her autonomy and caused a rift in the family.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author's action was a breach of trust and privacy, even with good intentions. Therefore, the answer is A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
