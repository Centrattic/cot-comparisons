I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about the author telling their sister's boyfriend about the sister's past abusive relationship. The sister was in an abusive situation with an ex who was like a pimp, and she's now with a new guy who might not know about that. The author told the new guy, thinking that it's important he knows because of how serious the relationship is (they're talking about marriage). The boyfriend reacted badly, yelling and throwing the author out. Then the sister cut off the author for that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The sister didn't disclose her past abuse to the boyfriend. The author felt it was important for him to know because it's a major factor in a potential marriage. But the author didn't check with the sister first\u2014they just told the boyfriend. So, the question is whether the author had the right to do that.\n\nOn one hand, the sister's past is her story to tell. The author might believe they were protecting their sister by ensuring the new guy knows her history, but by doing so, they bypassed the sister's consent. That's a problem because it's not their place to share someone else's private information without permission. The sister might have her reasons for not telling the boyfriend yet, or she might not want to share it at all. The author's actions could be seen as violating her privacy and autonomy.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's intention was to be honest and prevent a potential harmful relationship. If the boyfriend was unaware of the sister's past, and if he had known, he might have made a different decision. But the way the author handled it was confrontational and without the sister's consent, which could be seen as overstepping. The boyfriend's reaction was harsh, but maybe he was shocked. However, the sister being cut off is a consequence the author might not have anticipated.\n\nAlso, the author's comment to their parents about the sister's history and then acting on it without discussion with the sister herself shows a lack of consideration for her feelings and agency. The sister might have been working through her trauma and deciding when and how to share it. The author's decision to share it could have caused more harm by damaging the relationship with the boyfriend and leading to estrangement from the sister.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the key issue is the violation of trust and privacy. Even with good intentions, sharing someone's personal history without their consent is generally wrong. The author didn't respect the sister's autonomy in deciding whether to disclose her past. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because they overstepped their boundaries.\n"
