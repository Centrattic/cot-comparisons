I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author told their sister's boyfriend about the sister's past abuse by her ex, who was also her pimp. The sister had been hiding this from the current boyfriend. The author thinks that it's wrong to be in a relationship without disclosing such a significant history, especially since it might affect the boyfriend's decision to stay with her. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The sister is an adult and has the right to privacy. By revealing her past without her consent, the author might have violated her trust. Even if the author had good intentions, sharing someone's personal history without their permission could be seen as crossing a boundary. The boyfriend's reaction was to yell and throw the author out, which is aggressive, but maybe he felt his privacy was invaded too.\n\nThen there's the part about the author's skepticism towards the sister's claims about her agency in the abusive situation. That adds a layer of personal judgment. The author might believe the sister isn't being honest about her past, which could influence their decision to speak up. However, that's a sensitive area; assuming someone's lack of agency can be a form of judgment that the person might not appreciate.\n\nThe parents mentioned were also uncertain if the boyfriend knew, which might have contributed to the author's decision. But the parents' role here is a bit unclear. If they were also concerned, maybe they should have addressed it directly. But the author took it upon themselves instead.\n\nLegally, unless there's a duty to report abuse (which varies by jurisdiction), the author isn't legally obligated to disclose this. The sister's history is her story to tell. Even if the author is worried about the boyfriend's knowledge, it's the sister's choice to share her past with her partner. \n\nThe fallout is that the sister cut off the author. That's a significant consequence. The author might have thought they were helping, but the sister and boyfriend felt betrayed. It's possible the author didn't consider the potential harm to their relationship with the sister. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's concern about the boyfriend being in the dark about such a major issue could be seen as trying to protect him. However, the method of sharing the information\u2014without the sister's consent\u2014might be problematic. The author could have approached the sister first, expressed their concerns, and let her decide how to handle it with her boyfriend.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the principle of autonomy is key here. The sister has the right to make her own decisions, even if others disagree. The author's action might be seen as paternalistic, assuming they know what's best for her and her partner. \n\nSo, considering all these points, the author likely overstepped by sharing personal information that wasn't their place to disclose. The sister's trust was broken, and the author's intervention caused a rift in their relationship. Therefore, the author is probably in the wrong, which would be answer A.\n"
