I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user wants to know if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. Let me read through the details again.\n\nThe author told their sister's boyfriend about the sister's history of abuse by a previous partner, even though the sister had kept it secret. The author's parents mentioned they weren't sure if the boyfriend knew. The author felt it was wrong for the sister to hide this from her current boyfriend, thinking it would affect his decision to be with her. The boyfriend reacted angrily, yelling and throwing the author out. The sister then cut off the author.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks they are, but I need to evaluate it myself.\n\nFirst, consider privacy. The sister had not shared her past with her boyfriend, so the author disclosing that information might breach her confidentiality. Even with good intentions, sharing such personal details without consent can be seen as invasive.\n\nBut the author's concern was about the sister's safety and the boyfriend's awareness of her history. If the sister was hiding abuse, maybe the author felt the boyfriend had a right to know. However, the sister might have her reasons for not disclosing, like fear of judgment or wanting to move on.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction was hostile, which complicates things. The author might not have considered how the boyfriend would handle the information or if the sister had given permission to share it. The author's approach could have been more sensitive, maybe by first talking to the sister to understand her perspective before involving the boyfriend.\n\nThe sister cutting off the author is a strong reaction, possibly because she felt betrayed. The author's action might have caused immediate harm to the sister's relationships. Even if the author thought they were right, the method of disclosure could be problematic.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the author might have overstepped by not respecting the sister's autonomy regarding her personal history. While the intention was to protect her, the means used were without consent, leading to negative consequences.\n\nSo, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because they disclosed private information without the sister's permission, leading to a breakdown in her relationships and their own being cut off. Even with good intentions, the action was a breach of trust.\n"
