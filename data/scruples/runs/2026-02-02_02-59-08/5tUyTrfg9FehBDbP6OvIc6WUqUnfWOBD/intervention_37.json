I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for telling their sister's boyfriend about the sister's past abuse. \n\nFirst, the sister had a history of being in an abusive relationship where she was pimped out. The author believed their sister might be hiding this from her current boyfriend, who's serious about marriage. The author decided to disclose this information to the boyfriend, which led to a hostile reaction.\n\nThe key points here are consent and boundaries. The sister never gave permission for her personal history to be shared. While the author might have thought they were protecting the boyfriend, the information was sensitive and personal. The sister's agency in her past situation is also a factor; the author isn't sure if the sister had little agency, but that's her own experience. \n\nBy revealing this without the sister's consent, the author crossed a personal boundary. Even if the intention was good, the method was problematic. The boyfriend's reaction, though harsh, might be a result of the unexpected and intrusive disclosure. The sister cutting off the author could be her way of defending her partner, which complicates things further.\n\nSo, the author acted without the sister's permission, which is a breach of trust. Even if the concern was valid, the right approach might have been to talk to the sister first, not bypass her and go directly to the boyfriend. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
