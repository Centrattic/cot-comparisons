I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author did something wrong by telling their sister's boyfriend about her past. The situation is that the sister was in an abusive relationship where her ex was basically her pimp. The author thinks it's wrong to hide this from the current boyfriend, so they told him. The boyfriend reacted angrily, and the sister cut off the author. The question is whether the author was in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The sister had a traumatic experience with her ex. If she didn't tell her current boyfriend about it, maybe because she felt ashamed or didn't want to burden him, but the author believes that the boyfriend should know. However, the sister might have chosen to keep it private for her own reasons. The author might have good intentions, thinking they're protecting her from someone who wouldn't stick around if they knew, but maybe they overstepped by not respecting her privacy. \n\nThere's also the aspect of consent. Did the sister give permission for the author to share her history? Since the author didn't get that permission, it's possible they violated her trust. Even if the author thought they were doing the right thing, sharing such personal information without consent can be a breach of privacy. \n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend's reaction was harsh\u2014yelling and throwing the author out. That's not a sign of a healthy relationship either. The author might have been trying to prevent a future problem by being honest, but maybe there was a better way to handle it, like talking to the sister first. \n\nThe parents' reaction is also interesting. They weren't sure if the boyfriend knew the truth, which suggests that maybe the sister had kept it a secret. The author's decision to disclose it might have been based on their own judgment of the sister's situation, not realizing the potential consequences. \n\nSo, the key points are: Did the author have the right to disclose the information without the sister's consent? Was the information shared in a responsible manner? The sister's autonomy is important here. She might have her reasons for not telling her boyfriend, and the author's action could have undermined her agency. \n\nIn terms of accountability, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't respect the sister's privacy and made a judgment about her current relationship. However, the motivations were to protect her sister from a potentially problematic partner. But the method of disclosure\u2014going directly to the boyfriend without discussing it with the sister first\u2014was probably a mistake. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction was inappropriate, but that doesn't necessarily mean the author was right. The sister's response of cutting off the author is extreme, but it shows how hurt she felt that her privacy was breached. \n\nIn conclusion, the author likely overstepped by sharing personal information without consent, even with good intentions. So the answer would be AITA (Am I the Asshole) with the author being in the wrong because they didn't respect their sister's privacy and autonomy.\n"
