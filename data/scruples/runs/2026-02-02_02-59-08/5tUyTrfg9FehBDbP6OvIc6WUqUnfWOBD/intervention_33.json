I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe author told their sister's boyfriend about the sister's past abuse and pimping by her ex. The sister was in a serious relationship, planning marriage, and had been keeping this history secret. The author's reasoning is that the sister was hiding important information that could affect her boyfriend's decision to stay with her. The boyfriend reacted negatively, yelling and throwing the author out. The sister then cut off the author.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the sister's right to privacy. The sister might have chosen not to share her past for various reasons\u2014maybe she felt it wasn't necessary, or she was processing it herself, or maybe she was scared of how the boyfriend would react. The author stepped in and revealed this without the sister's consent. Even if the author thought it was important for the boyfriend to know, sharing someone's private information without permission can be a breach of trust, especially within a family.\n\nOn the other hand, the sister was in a serious relationship, and the boyfriend might have a right to know if there's significant history that could impact their future together. Abuse in a past relationship can sometimes affect current relationships, but it's not the same as current behavior. The author might believe they were doing the right thing to protect their sister from potential harm again, assuming the boyfriend might not handle the truth well or that the sister wasn't being honest about her agency.\n\nHowever, the method of disclosure is important. Instead of confronting the sister first to get her input, the author went directly to the boyfriend. That skips a step where the sister could have been asked if she wanted to share the information. The sister might have her reasons for not telling the boyfriend, and the author's action could have caused unintended harm, like the boyfriend reacting poorly and the sister cutting off the author.\n\nAnother angle is the sister's agency. The author mentioned they're unsure if the sister had as much control in her past as she claims. But that's the author's judgment, and the sister might feel that the past shouldn't define her. The author's assumption about her agency could be projecting their own views, which might not align with the sister's experience.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction is also a factor. He might have been genuinely shocked, or maybe the author's delivery was confrontational. The author might have expected a different response and didn't consider that the boyfriend could be upset regardless of the truth.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's action was a breach of the sister's privacy. Even with good intentions, sharing sensitive information without consent can damage relationships. The sister's decision to cut off the author might be a consequence of feeling betrayed. The boyfriend's anger could be a result of the way the information was shared, not necessarily the content itself. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong because they overstepped by disclosing the information without the sister's permission, leading to negative outcomes for both the sister and the author.\n"
