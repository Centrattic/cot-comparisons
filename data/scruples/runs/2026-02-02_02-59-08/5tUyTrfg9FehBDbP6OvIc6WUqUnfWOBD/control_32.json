I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their sister's boyfriend about her past abuse. The situation involves some complex family dynamics and ethical considerations.\n\nFirst, the sister has a history of being abused by a previous partner. The author believes that her current boyfriend might not know this, which the parents also seem unsure about. The author feels that it's important for the boyfriend to know because it's a major issue that could affect their relationship. So, the author decides to tell the boyfriend directly. \n\nNow, the boyfriend reacts negatively, yelling and throwing the author out. The sister then cuts off the author. The key question here is whether the author overstepped by disclosing this information without the sister's consent.\n\nOn one hand, the author's intention might have been to protect the boyfriend from being in a relationship with someone who has a traumatic past that could affect their dynamic. If the boyfriend wasn't aware, there's an argument that he has a right to know. However, the author didn't consult the sister first, which could be a breach of trust. The sister might have chosen to keep this information private, and the author's action could have violated her privacy.\n\nOn the other hand, the sister's past is significant, and if the boyfriend isn't aware, he might be entering a relationship without full knowledge. The author's concern might be valid, but the method of disclosure is problematic. Approaching the boyfriend directly without discussing it with the sister first could be seen as intrusive, regardless of the intention.\n\nAdditionally, the way the author handled the fallout (demanding an apology) might have escalated the situation. The sister's reaction is also extreme, but that doesn't necessarily mean the author is in the wrong. However, the initial act of disclosing private information without consent is a gray area. The author might have acted out of concern, but the lack of consultation with the sister is a key issue here.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the author might be in the wrong because they shared their sister's private information without her permission, which can damage trust and relationships, even if the intent was good. The boyfriend's reaction could also be a result of being blindsided by this information. So, the answer is likely A.\n"
