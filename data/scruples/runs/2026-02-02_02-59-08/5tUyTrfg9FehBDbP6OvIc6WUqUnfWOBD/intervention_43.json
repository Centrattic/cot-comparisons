I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author telling their sister's boyfriend about the sister's abusive past, which the sister had kept hidden.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The sister had a history of being in an abusive relationship where she was treated as a pimp's girlfriend. The author feels that the boyfriend should know this because it's a significant factor in their serious relationship. The parents didn't know if the boyfriend was aware, which adds complexity.\n\nThe key issue here is whether the author had the right to disclose this information. The sister's confidentiality is a major factor. Even if the author has concerns about the sister's judgment, sharing personal and sensitive information without consent can be a breach of privacy. The sister might have chosen not to disclose her past for various reasons\u2014maybe she wasn't ready, or it's a sensitive topic they don't want to discuss with her boyfriend yet. \n\nThe author's intention might have been to protect the boyfriend from being unaware of a serious issue, but that doesn't necessarily justify the action without the sister's consent. The boyfriend's reaction, while harsh, shows that the information might have been a shock, and the author could have handled it differently, perhaps by discussing it with the sister first. \n\nAdditionally, the author's demand for an apology from the boyfriend after the confrontation could have been seen as adding pressure, possibly making the situation worse. The sister cutting off the author is a strong reaction, but it might be because she felt her privacy was invaded. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author acted on their own judgment without considering the sister's autonomy to share her own story. The sister's agency in her relationship and how she chooses to handle her past is her own decision. The author's intervention might have crossed a boundary by not respecting her privacy, even with good intentions. \n\nSo, considering all these points, the answer is likely that the author is in the wrong because they disclosed private information without consent, which is a violation of their sister's privacy.\n"
