I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for telling the sister's boyfriend about her abusive past. \n\nFirst, the sister was in an abusive relationship where her ex was essentially her pimp. The author mentions that to the boyfriend, thinking the boyfriend wasn't aware. The sister's ex was abusive, which is a serious issue. The author believed that the boyfriend should know this to make an informed decision about the relationship.\n\nThe sister's boyfriend reacted angrily and yelled, which might indicate he was upset, but maybe not because he was surprised. The author then asked for an apology from the boyfriend, and the sister cut off the author.\n\nNow, considering the ethical aspects. The author's intention was to protect the boyfriend from being in a relationship with someone who had a traumatic past, possibly without his knowledge. But did the author have the right to disclose that information? The sister might have chosen not to share her history, so the author's action could be seen as violating her privacy.\n\nHowever, the boyfriend has a right to know if he's entering a serious relationship with someone who has a history of abuse, especially if the sister is being manipulative. But the author didn't confirm with the sister whether she had shared this with the boyfriend. The parents also weren't sure, so the author acted on their own judgment.\n\nThe key factors here are consent and the right to privacy. The author didn't get the sister's permission to share her history. Even if the intention was good, the method might be wrong. The sister might feel that her autonomy was violated, especially if she wanted to handle the disclosure on her own terms.\n\nOn the other hand, if the sister was covering up her past and the boyfriend was unaware, there's a moral argument that the boyfriend has a right to know. But the author's approach was direct and without consulting the sister first, which could be seen as overstepping.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction suggests he was either already aware and angry that the author exposed it, or he was genuinely upset. Either way, the author's action led to the sister cutting them off. The author's responsibility here is debatable. They might have thought they were helping, but without the sister's consent, it's a breach of trust.\n\nIn terms of right vs. wrong, the author's action wasn't illegal, but morally, it's a gray area. However, the sister's reaction is extreme, but the author's disclosure might have been unnecessary. The answer depends on whether the sister had the right to keep that information private. If the sister was being honest and the boyfriend didn't know, maybe the author did the right thing. But if the sister chose not to share, then the author overstepped.\n\nGiven the scenario, the author didn't confirm the boyfriend's ignorance, and the sister's reaction is harsh, but the author's intention was to protect someone. However, the method was flawed. The answer could be that the author is in the wrong for not respecting the sister's privacy, even if the intention was good.\n"
