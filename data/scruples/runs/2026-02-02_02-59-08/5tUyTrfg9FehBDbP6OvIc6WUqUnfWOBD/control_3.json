I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author told their sister's boyfriend about the sister's past abuse. The sister had a history with an abusive ex who was like a pimp, and the author was concerned because the current boyfriend didn't know. The author thought it was wrong to hide such a major issue, so they went to the boyfriend and told him directly. The boyfriend reacted angrily, yelling and throwing them out. Then the sister cut off the author.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author overstepped. The sister might have her reasons for not telling her boyfriend, maybe she's not ready or it's a sensitive issue. The author assumed they had the right to disclose this information without the sister's consent. Even though the author's intention was to protect their sister's future husband, they didn't get her permission first. That's a key point. Privacy and consent are important here. \n\nAlso, the sister's agency in her past situation is mentioned as something the author is unsure about. But the author still went ahead without confirming if the sister wanted this information shared. Even if the author believed it was for her own good, the act of sharing private information without consent could be seen as a breach of trust. The sister's reaction shows that she's upset, which might indicate that the author's action hurt their relationship irreparably.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might argue that the information was crucial for the boyfriend's knowledge, especially since they're considering marriage. But the boyfriend's reaction was defensive, which could mean he didn't take it well, even if he didn't know before. However, the author's approach of confronting the boyfriend directly without involving the sister might have been too abrupt and invasive.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether the author had the right to disclose such sensitive information without the sister's approval. Even with good intentions, the method and consent are important factors. The sister's right to privacy and autonomy in deciding who knows her past should be respected. Therefore, the author's action, while possibly well-meaning, was likely a breach of trust and overstepped boundaries.\n"
