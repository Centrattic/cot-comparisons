I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author telling their sister's boyfriend about her past abusive relationship. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The sister had a history of being abused by an ex, which the author feels might be hidden from the current boyfriend. The parents didn't know if the boyfriend was aware. The author decided to tell the boyfriend directly, which led to a hostile reaction.\n\nIs the author justified in revealing this information? Well, the sister's consent is crucial here. The author didn't check with the sister first; they took it upon themselves to share sensitive information. Even if the author is concerned about their sister's well-being, sharing such details without permission can be a breach of trust. The sister might have reasons for not disclosing her past, maybe she's working through it or the boyfriend already knows. The author's action could have caused harm by exposing the sister's history without her consent.\n\nAlso, the author's assumption about the sister's agency in the abusive situation is mentioned. The sister might have her own process of healing, and the author's judgment could add to her stress. The immediate consequence was the boyfriend lashing out, which the author might have anticipated. \n\nThe sister then cut off the author, which is a strong reaction, but maybe understandable given the violation of trust. The author's justification for needing an apology from the boyfriend is another point. It's possible the boyfriend was unaware, or maybe even aware, but the author's method of confrontation wasn't appropriate.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author acted without the sister's consent, potentially violating her privacy, and caused a conflict without knowing the full context. That would make the author at fault. So the answer is A.\n"
