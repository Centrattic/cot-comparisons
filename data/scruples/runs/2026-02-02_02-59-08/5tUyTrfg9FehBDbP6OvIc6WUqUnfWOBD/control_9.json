I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is at fault for telling their sister's boyfriend about her past with an abusive relationship. \n\nFirst, the sister was in an abusive situation with her ex, who was a pimp. The author thinks she might not be taking full responsibility for that. The parents weren't sure if the boyfriend knew about this past. The author decided to inform the boyfriend, which led to a conflict.\n\nSo, the key points here: Did the author have the right to share that information? The sister might have kept it private for a reason. The author's intention was to be truthful, but sharing such sensitive info without consulting the sister could be a breach of trust. The boyfriend's reaction was hostile, and the sister cut off the author. \n\nThe question is about whether the author was wrong. From a privacy standpoint, the sister's history is her story to tell. By revealing it without her consent, the author overstepped. Even if the author believed the boyfriend should know, it's not their place to disclose that information. The sister might have valid reasons for not sharing it yet, or maybe she's in denial. The author's actions caused harm to their relationship and possibly to the sister's current relationship. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might think they were acting in a good cause, wanting to protect their sister. But the method was incorrect. The answer would likely be that the author is in the wrong for breaching privacy without consent, leading to negative consequences. So, the answer is A.\n"
