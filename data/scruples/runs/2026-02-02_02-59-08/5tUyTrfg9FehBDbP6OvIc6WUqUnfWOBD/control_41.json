I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author telling the sister's boyfriend about her abusive past. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The sister was in an abusive relationship where she was treated as a pimp's victim. The author thinks it's wrong that the boyfriend didn't know about this and that the sister didn't disclose it. The parents also weren't sure if the boyfriend knew. The author then confronts the boyfriend, leading to conflict.\n\nThe key points here are consent and privacy. The author went to the boyfriend and shared information that the sister might have kept private. Even if the author believed the boyfriend should know, did they have the right to disclose this without the sister's permission? The sister might have chosen not to tell him for various reasons\u2014maybe she was ready to move on, or maybe she was afraid of his reaction. The author's action could be seen as violating her privacy.\n\nAlso, the boyfriend's reaction was negative, and the sister cut off the author. The author then demands an apology from the boyfriend. But the sister is upset with the author for interfering. The question is whether the author overstepped.\n\nEthically, people have the right to confidentiality regarding their personal history, especially traumatic experiences. Unless there's a danger to others, sharing such information without consent is problematic. The author might have good intentions, thinking they're protecting their sister, but the method of disclosure was without her approval. This could be seen as the author's mistake.\n\nOn the other hand, the sister's partner should be aware of such a significant part of her past, especially since they're considering marriage. But the author's approach might have been abrupt and without considering the sister's wishes. The right approach might have been to talk to the sister first, encouraging her to share the information herself.\n\nSo, the author's wrong in this case would be breaching the sister's privacy. Even if the information is important, it's the sister's responsibility to disclose it. Therefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
