I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author telling the sister's boyfriend about the sister's abusive past. First, I need to consider the key elements here.\n\nThe sister has a history of being in an abusive relationship where she was pimped by her ex. The author thinks it's wrong that the boyfriend doesn't know about this, which might affect his decision to marry her. The author decides to tell the boyfriend, leading to a confrontation where the boyfriend reacts angrily. The sister then cuts off the author.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether the author had the right to disclose this information. On one hand, the author might believe they're acting in their sister's best interest, wanting the boyfriend to be aware of her past to make an informed decision. Abusers can sometimes try to cover up past issues, so maybe the author is trying to protect their sister from being in another bad situation.\n\nBut on the other hand, the sister might have chosen not to share that information with her boyfriend. By revealing it without her consent, the author violated her privacy. The sister's right to control her own narrative and personal information is important here. Even if the author suspects the sister isn't being truthful, it's not their place to disclose such sensitive information without permission.\n\nAdditionally, the author's actions led to the boyfriend reacting negatively, which resulted in the sister cutting off the author. This outcome could be seen as a consequence of the author's interference. The boyfriend's reaction might be due to surprise, anger, or feeling lied to, but the author's method of handling it by confronting him directly could be problematic. The author didn't approach the sister first to discuss this, which might have been a better step.\n\nThe sister's response to the author is also a factor. If she's in a serious relationship, the author's actions might strain that relationship, and the sister might feel betrayed. The author's demand for an apology from the boyfriend could further escalate the situation without considering the sister's wishes.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author's intention might be to protect their sister, but the method of disclosure without consent is generally considered a breach of privacy. People have the right to decide what personal information to share with their partners. Unless there's immediate danger, others shouldn't disclose such information without permission.\n\nSo, while the author might have good intentions, the action of revealing the sister's past without her consent is likely the wrong move. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
