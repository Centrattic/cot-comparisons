I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author did the wrong thing by telling her sister's boyfriend about the abusive past. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the sister was in an abusive relationship that was also like a pimp situation. She's now dating someone serious, maybe for marriage. The author told their parents that the guy is good for the sister considering her history. The parents didn't know if the new boyfriend knew about the past. The author then decided to tell the boyfriend directly. The boyfriend reacted badly, yelled, and threw her out. The sister then cut off the author.\n\nThe author's reasoning was that it's wrong to be in a relationship without disclosing such a major history. But the boyfriend's reaction was unexpected. The sister is upset and wants the author out of her life.\n\nHmm. So the key here is whether the author had the right to disclose that information. The sister might have wanted to keep her past private, especially if she's moving on. The author might feel protective, but maybe they overstepped.\n\nConfidentiality is important in family matters. The sister might have chosen not to tell her boyfriend for various reasons\u2014maybe she wasn't ready, felt it was none of his business, or feared rejection. By the author telling him, they might have violated the sister's privacy and trust. Even if the author thought it was for the best, sharing such sensitive information without consent can be seen as crossing a boundary.\n\nOn the other hand, if the sister's past is still affecting her current relationship, the boyfriend might need to know. But it's her choice to disclose it, not the sister's sibling's. The author's intention might have been good, but the method was wrong. The boyfriend's reaction could be due to not knowing how to handle the information, but the author's action led to conflict.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author probably did the wrong thing by not consulting the sister first and sharing personal information without her permission. Even if the sister had agency in her past, the decision to reveal it is hers. The author's interference caused a rift in the sister's relationships. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
