I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author did the wrong thing by telling the sister's boyfriend about her abusive past. The main points are:\n\n1. The author's sister was in an abusive relationship where she was pimped out by her ex. She's now with a new guy, and the author thinks it's wrong to hide this from him.\n2. The author told the boyfriend, who reacted angrily, and then the sister cut off the author.\n\nFirst, I need to consider confidentiality and boundaries. The sister had a traumatic experience, and it's her right to decide when and how to share such personal information. By revealing this without her consent, the author overstepped. Even if the author's intentions were to protect the boyfriend, it's not their place to act as a moral arbiter here.\n\nThen, there's the question of the sister's agency. The author isn't sure if she had no control in the past situation, but that's speculative. Assuming she's hiding this might not be accurate. The author's role is to support the sister, not to expose her past without her agreement.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction could be due to shock or defensiveness, but the author's action led to conflict. The sister cutting off the author is a consequence of the breach of trust. The author's approach was invasive and potentially harmful, disrupting the sister's current relationship without her consent.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author's intent might be seen as protective, but the method was wrong. The sister's autonomy and privacy are important. So, the answer is likely A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
