I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this AITA question. So, the user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the story) is in the wrong for telling their sister's boyfriend about her past abuse. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the sister's history: she was in an abusive relationship where her ex was like a pimp. She's now with a new guy, and the author feels that hiding this major part of her history is wrong. The author told the boyfriend about it, leading to a confrontation where the boyfriend yelled and threw the author out. The sister then cut off communication.\n\nThe key points here are the author's intentions and the boundaries they crossed. The author's motivation was concern for their sister and the boyfriend, thinking the boyfriend should know about the abusive past. However, the sister might have chosen to keep that information private, perhaps out of shame, fear of the boyfriend leaving, or other personal reasons. The author didn't consult with the sister first, which could be a breach of trust. \n\nEven if the author's intent was good, sharing someone else's private information without their consent can be seen as violating their autonomy. The sister may have wanted to disclose her history on her own terms. The boyfriend's reaction could be due to being shocked or not handling the situation well, but the author's action of revealing the secret without permission might be problematic.\n\nAlso, the author's follow-up demand for an apology from the boyfriend complicates things. It adds pressure and could be seen as taking sides, which might have contributed to the sister cutting ties. \n\nSo, while the author's intention was to protect their sister and the boyfriend, the method used\u2014without the sister's consent\u2014might be considered overstepping. The wrongness here hinges on respecting others' privacy and autonomy versus the intent to help. Therefore, the author could be in the wrong for not respecting the sister's privacy and for intervening without her knowledge.\n"
