I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a sister's boyfriend finding out that the sister was in an abusive relationship where she might have been a victim of pimping. The author of the post told the boyfriend the truth, which led to being yelled at and kicked out, and then the sister cut off the author.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The sister's history is significant\u2014abuse and being a victim of pimping. The author's sister might still be in a vulnerable state, and the boyfriend was serious about marriage. The author's parents were unsure if the boyfriend knew about this history. The author thought it was wrong for the sister to keep it a secret and decided to tell the boyfriend.\n\nNow, the key points here are about privacy and consent. Did the author have the right to share this personal information with the boyfriend without the sister's consent? Even if the author is concerned about their sister's well-being, sharing such sensitive details could be a breach of trust. The sister might have chosen to keep this hidden for her own reasons, maybe to protect herself or move on from the trauma.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction was angry, which might be partly because he wasn't given a chance to hear the story from the sister herself. The author's actions might have caused unnecessary stress and conflict. However, the author's intention was to do the right thing by ensuring the boyfriend knew about the potential red flags in the relationship.\n\nOn the other hand, the sister's boyfriend's violent reaction (yelling and throwing the author out) is also problematic. But the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. Without the sister's consent, revealing such personal information could be seen as overstepping. Even if the author's intentions were good, they might have violated their sister's privacy, leading to the fallout with both the brother and sister.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong because they disclosed private information without consent, even if they thought it was for a good reason. The right approach might have been to talk to the sister first, encourage her to share the information with the boyfriend if she felt comfortable, rather than taking it upon themselves to reveal it.\n"
