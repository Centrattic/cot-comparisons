I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author told their sister's boyfriend about the sister's past abuse. The sister had a history of being in an abusive relationship where she was pimped out, and now she's in a serious relationship with this new guy. The author felt that the guy didn't know about her past and thought it was wrong for her to hide that major detail. The author went to the guy's apartment, told him directly, and he reacted angrily. Then the author asked the sister for an apology from the boyfriend, which led to the sister cutting off the author.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The sister's privacy and consent are key factors. The author didn't consult the sister before revealing her past. Even if the author didn't believe her claim about her lack of agency, they made the decision to disclose it to the boyfriend without her permission. That's a big deal because people have the right to decide who knows about their personal history, especially traumatic experiences. The author might have thought they were protecting their sister or giving the boyfriend a chance to know the truth, but they overstepped by not getting consent.\n\nThen there's the sister's reaction. She might feel that her privacy was violated, which can damage trust between siblings. The boyfriend's reaction was hostile, which is understandable if he felt blindsided. The author might have been trying to be honest, but the method was invasive. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's intention might have been to help, thinking that the boyfriend deserved to know the truth to make an informed decision. However, the right to privacy is usually the individual's to control. The author should have discussed this with the sister first instead of disclosing it directly to the boyfriend. \n\nSo, the key issue here is consent and respecting boundaries. The author didn't get the sister's permission to share such personal information. Even if the information is sensitive and important, the sister should have the autonomy to decide whether to disclose it herself. The author's action, while possibly well-intentioned, breached that trust. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because they violated their sister's privacy without her consent.\n"
