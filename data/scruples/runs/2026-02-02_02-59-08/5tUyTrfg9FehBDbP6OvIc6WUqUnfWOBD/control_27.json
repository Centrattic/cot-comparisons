I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for telling their sister's boyfriend about the sister's past abuse. \n\nFirst, the sister's boyfriend was supposedly serious about the relationship, even talking marriage. The author's sister had a history of being abused by a previous partner who was also her pimp. The author told the parents, who then mentioned they weren't sure if the current boyfriend knew. The author decided to inform the boyfriend directly, which led to a confrontation where the boyfriend yelled and threw them out. The sister then cut off the author.\n\nSo, the key points here are about boundaries, consent to share personal information, and the potential consequences of revealing sensitive information. The author might argue that they were protecting their sister from a bad situation by ensuring the boyfriend was aware of her history. On the other hand, the sister's privacy is a big factor. Even if the author thought the boyfriend should know, was it their place to share that information without the sister's consent? \n\nAlso, the sister's agency is mentioned\u2014there's some doubt about how much control she had in the abusive situation. The author might not fully trust her account, but that's their own judgment. However, disclosing such personal details without consent can be seen as a violation of privacy, regardless of intent. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction was extreme, but the author's action might have crossed a line. Relationships are between the two people involved, and family members stepping in with such sensitive info could be considered overstepping. Even if the intention was good, the method of sharing the information without the sister's approval might be the issue. \n\nThe sister cutting off the author shows the impact of the action. The author might not be in the wrong if they thought they were helping, but the main ethical issue is the unauthorized disclosure of personal trauma. So, the answer would likely be A (author is in the wrong) because they shared private information without consent, which is a breach of privacy and trust.\n"
