I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The person is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author telling their sister's boyfriend about a traumatic event in the sister's past\u2014specifically that she was in an abusive relationship with a previous partner who was like a pimp. The sister is currently in a serious relationship, and the author felt it was important to inform the boyfriend because they believed the sister might be hiding this from him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The sister's past is a sensitive and private matter. The author's intention was to protect the boyfriend by revealing something significant that could affect the relationship. However, the author didn't directly consult the sister before doing this. The sister had already chosen to not disclose this to her current boyfriend, possibly for reasons of her own, maybe to protect herself or because she felt ready to move on.\n\nSo, the author took it upon themselves to inform the boyfriend without the sister's consent. This raises privacy issues. Even if the author believes they're acting in good faith, sharing someone else's private information without their permission can be a breach of trust. The sister might have wanted to handle the disclosure herself, and the author's actions could have undermined her agency. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction was hostile, which might indicate that the information was unexpected and perhaps not received well. The author then demanded an apology from the boyfriend, which led to the sister cutting off the author. \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, there's no crime here, but in terms of social ethics, the key points are consent to share personal information and respecting the sister's autonomy. The author might have good intentions, but the method of disclosure was without consent, which can be seen as overstepping boundaries. \n\nIn many relationships, discussing past abuse is a sensitive topic that the person involved should control. The author's action could be viewed as violating the sister's privacy and possibly complicating her current relationship, especially if the boyfriend wasn't prepared for that information. \n\nHowever, if the author genuinely believed the boyfriend was being deceived and that the sister wasn't being honest, there might be an argument that the author was trying to prevent harm. But the right to disclose such information is typically with the person who experienced it, not a family member acting as a proxy. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author likely overstepped by not respecting the sister's decision to keep her past private, even if their intentions were good. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
