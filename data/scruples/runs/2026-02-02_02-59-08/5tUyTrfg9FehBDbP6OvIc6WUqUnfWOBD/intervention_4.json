I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author telling their sister's boyfriend about the sister's past where she was abused by her previous partner. The parents were unsure if the boyfriend knew, and the author thought it was wrong to keep this secret. The boyfriend reacted angrily, leading to the sister cutting off the author.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The sister was in a serious relationship, talking about marriage. The author believes the boyfriend should know about her past abuse because it's a major factor that might affect the relationship. The author's intention was to protect their sister by being honest, but they chose to tell the boyfriend directly instead of discussing it with the sister first.\n\nFrom a confidentiality standpoint, the author might have overstepped. Family members often share personal information, but the sister might have wanted to disclose her past on her own terms. The author's action could be seen as violating the sister's privacy, even if their intention was good. The sister's reaction\u2014cutting off the author\u2014suggests that she felt betrayed, which indicates the author's action might have caused more harm than good.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's concern is valid. The sister was involved with someone who might not know about a significant part of her history. However, the method of addressing it was problematic. The right approach might have been to talk to the sister first, express concerns, and let her decide how to handle the situation. By going directly to the boyfriend, the author bypassed the sister's autonomy and potentially caused a breakdown in family relationships.\n\nThere's also the ethical aspect of sharing someone's private information without their consent. Even with good intentions, the author's action could be considered a breach of trust. The boyfriend's reaction, while harsh, might be a result of being blindsided by such sensitive information without the sister's input.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the key factors are intent, action, and consequences. The author's intent was to protect their sister's future, but the action taken (telling the boyfriend without consulting the sister) led to negative consequences. The sister's decision to cut off the author shows that the method was inappropriate, even if the underlying concern was valid.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't respect their sister's privacy and autonomy. They should have discussed their concerns with her first rather than disclosing directly to the boyfriend. The answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
