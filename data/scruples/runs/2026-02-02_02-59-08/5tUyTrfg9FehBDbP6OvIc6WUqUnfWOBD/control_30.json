I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who shared their situation is at fault. The situation involves telling a sister's boyfriend about the sister's past abuse and possible pimping by her ex. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The sister had a traumatic experience with her previous partner, and this new boyfriend is serious enough that they're talking about marriage. The author believes that the boyfriend should know about this history because it's a major factor in her past, which might affect the relationship. The parents weren't sure if the boyfriend knew, so the author took it upon themselves to inform him.\n\nBut wait, does the author have the right to disclose this information? The sister might have chosen not to share her past, so by revealing it without her consent, the author could be violating her privacy. Even if the author is concerned about the boyfriend's awareness, they might have a responsibility to respect their sister's autonomy.\n\nThen there's the reaction: the boyfriend yelled and threw the author out. That's a strong reaction, but it's unclear if he was already aware. The author then demands an apology from the boyfriend, leading the sister to cut off the author. \n\nThe key points here are consent and the right to privacy. The author acted without the sister's permission, which could be seen as overstepping. Even if the intention was to protect the sister from a potentially harmful relationship, it's not the author's place to make that judgment and disclose such sensitive information. The sister might have her reasons for not telling her boyfriend, whether she's trying to move past the trauma or protect him from the truth.\n\nOn the other hand, if the sister is being manipulative or hiding her past for a dangerous reason, the author might think they're helping. But without knowing the full context, it's hard to justify breaching trust. The author's actions led to a breakdown in family relations, which is significant. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author likely did the wrong thing by not getting consent and interfering in their sister's relationship. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
