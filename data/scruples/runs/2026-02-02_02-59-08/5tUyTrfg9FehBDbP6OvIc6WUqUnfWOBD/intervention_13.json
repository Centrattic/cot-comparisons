I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author told their sister's boyfriend about her past with an abusive ex. The sister had hidden this history from him. The author believed it was important for the boyfriend to know, especially since they were planning to get married. The boyfriend reacted angrily, and the sister then cut off the author.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The author's intention was to protect their sister from a potentially bad situation. If the sister was hiding a major part of her past, maybe the author thought the boyfriend had a right to know. But on the other hand, the author didn't go through the sister first. They took it upon themselves to disclose something personal, which could be seen as a breach of trust between siblings.\n\nThe sister had a history of abuse, and the author is unsure if the sister had control over that situation. If the sister is in denial or not fully recovered, sharing this information might not be helpful. The author might have thought they were helping, but by not discussing it with the sister first, they could have caused more harm. The boyfriend's reaction was hostile, and the sister is now upset with the author.\n\nAnother angle is the author's right to privacy versus the potential harm of not knowing. The boyfriend might need to know this to make an informed decision, but the way it's delivered matters. The author's method of disclosure\u2014going to the boyfriend directly without the sister's consent\u2014could be problematic. It's possible that the sister wanted to handle it herself, and the author overstepped by not respecting her wishes.\n\nAlso, the author's judgment about their sister's agency in the past situation might be flawed. They might not fully understand the sister's experience, which could lead to misjudging the situation. This could mean the author acted out of their own assumptions rather than the sister's actual needs.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author might have crossed a boundary by not discussing it with the sister first. The sister has the right to control her own narrative and decide when and how to share her past. The author's action could strain the family relationship, leading to the sister cutting them off.\n\nHowever, there's also the argument that the author was trying to prevent the boyfriend from being blindsided by a major issue in the future. If the sister had kept this hidden, the boyfriend might have found out later in a worse way. But that's speculative. The author's approach was direct and maybe not the best way to handle it.\n\nSo weighing all these factors, the key points are: the author's intent to protect, the method of disclosure without consent, and the resulting harm to the family dynamic. Depending on cultural norms and personal boundaries, the answer might vary. But generally, sharing someone else's private information without their permission is usually seen as a breach of trust. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting their sister's autonomy in this matter.\n"
