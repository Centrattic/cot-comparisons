I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author told their sister's boyfriend about the sister's abusive past, which the boyfriend might not have known. The sister had a history of being in an abusive relationship where she was treated poorly, and now the author felt it was important to inform the new boyfriend because the sister was keeping that information hidden.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The author's intention was to protect their sister's future partner from being in a relationship with someone who had been through abuse. But did they cross a boundary by sharing this private information without the sister's consent? That's a big point. The sister might have chosen not to tell her boyfriend for various reasons\u2014maybe she was ready to move on, or she was afraid of his reaction, or she felt it was her personal matter to handle. The author's action of disclosing this could be seen as a violation of the sister's privacy.\n\nThen there's the sister's reaction. She cut off the author completely, which is a strong response. The boyfriend reacted angrily, but maybe because he felt blindsided or that his privacy was invaded. The author justified it by saying it was the truth and important, but in relationships, trust and consent matter a lot. The author didn't check with the sister first, so they might have overstepped.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might have been concerned about their sister's well-being, thinking the boyfriend should know about the abuse to make an informed decision. But the sister might have her own reasons for not disclosing it yet. The author's approach was confrontational, and they set a condition for staying in the sister's life based on an apology from the boyfriend, which the sister rejected.\n\nSo considering all that, the author's action was a breach of the sister's privacy. Even if the intent was good, the method was problematic. The right approach might have been to talk to the sister first, support her in making that decision, rather than taking it upon themselves to tell the boyfriend. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong here.\n"
