I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this situation. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong after telling their sister's boyfriend about her past. The sister had been in an abusive relationship and was manipulated, almost like being pimped out. The author felt it was important to inform the boyfriend because they believed the sister was hiding this major issue. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The sister's past is a sensitive topic. Even if the author is concerned about her sister's well-being, sharing such personal information without her consent is a breach of privacy. The sister might have chosen not to disclose this to her boyfriend for various reasons, maybe she's not ready, or they have privacy boundaries.\n\nThen there's the aspect of the author's motivation. They mention they're unsure about their sister's agency in the previous relationship. That could indicate the author has their own doubts about the sister's decisions, but does that justify revealing private information? Maybe the author should have approached the sister first instead of directly confronting the boyfriend.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction was negative, which makes sense if he was blindsided. Even if the information is true, the way it's delivered matters. The sister might feel violated that her private history was shared without her consent. The author's action likely caused a rift in the family relationships, leading to the sister cutting them off.\n\nAlso, the author's assumption that the boyfriend didn't know the sister's history might not be accurate. The parents mentioned they weren't sure, but the author didn't confirm this. Acting on incomplete information can lead to misunderstandings. The author's approach was direct and possibly confrontational, which might not have been the best way to handle the situation.\n\nIn terms of boundaries, family members have a right to privacy. Even with good intentions, the author overstepped by disclosing the sister's past to the boyfriend. The sister's autonomy in deciding what to share about her life should be respected. The author's action could be seen as a violation of that trust, especially since it led to the boyfriend's negative reaction and the sister's anger.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the author's actions were well-intentioned but crossed a line by not respecting their sister's privacy. They should have had a conversation with their sister first to address their concerns rather than going directly to the boyfriend. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
