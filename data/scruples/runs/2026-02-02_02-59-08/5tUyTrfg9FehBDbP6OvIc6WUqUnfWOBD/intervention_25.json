I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. The main issue is that the author told their sister's boyfriend about her past abusive relationship. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The sister had a history of being abused by a previous partner who was also acting like a pimp. The author feels that the current boyfriend might not know this, and they think it's wrong for the sister to keep it a secret. The author then decides to inform the boyfriend directly, which leads to a confrontation and the sister cutting off the author.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that the boyfriend should know about the sister's past, as it's a significant factor in their relationship. However, the key here is whether the author had the right to disclose this information without the sister's consent. Even if the author believes the sister is hiding something important, sharing personal information without permission can be a breach of privacy and trust.\n\nThe sister's reaction is to cut off the author, which might indicate that she feels her privacy was violated. The boyfriend's anger could be due to the surprise of the information or feeling attacked. But regardless of his reaction, the author's action of disclosing private details without consent is problematic. \n\nEven if the author had good intentions, the method of communicating this sensitive information was direct and without the sister's approval. In many cases, family boundaries suggest that personal disclosures should be made by the individual involved, not by a third party. The author overstepped by sharing the sister's history, which could be seen as meddling in the relationship without the sister's consent. \n\nSo, while the author might think they were helping, the act of divulging personal information without permission typically places them in the wrong. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
