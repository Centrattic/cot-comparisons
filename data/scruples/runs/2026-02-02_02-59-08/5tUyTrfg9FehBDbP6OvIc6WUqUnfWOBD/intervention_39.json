I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their sister's boyfriend about her past abuse. \n\nFirst, the sister was in a situation where she was abused and possibly pimped by her ex. The author thinks the sister isn't being honest about her agency in that situation. The parents didn't tell the boyfriend, but the author decided to do it themselves.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether the author had the right to disclose this information without the sister's consent. The author's reasoning is that it's important for the boyfriend to know, especially since the relationship is serious. But on the other hand, the sister might have boundaries about who knows her past, and the author might have overstepped by sharing it without her permission.\n\nThe boyfriend reacted negatively, which could be because he didn't like being blindsided or maybe because he felt it was an invasion. The author then asked for an apology from the boyfriend, leading the sister to cut off contact. \n\nI need to consider if the author's action was justified. While the intention might be to protect the sister from a potentially harmful relationship, privacy and consent are important. Even if the sister's past is concerning, the author isn't in a position to make decisions for her. The sister might have reasons for not disclosing that history, maybe to protect herself or to be judged. The author's intervention could have caused more harm by breaking trust and causing the relationship to end abruptly.\n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting the sister's privacy and making decisions about her life without her consent. Even if the author's intentions were good, the method was inappropriate.\n"
