I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person telling the story) is in the wrong for telling their sister's boyfriend about her past. So, the sister had a history of being in an abusive relationship where she was treated like a pimp. The author thought it was wrong that the sister was keeping this from her current boyfriend, who's serious about marriage.\n\nThe parents thought the boyfriend might not know, so the author went to the boyfriend and told him. The boyfriend reacted angrily, yelling and throwing them out. Then the author asked the sister for an apology from the boyfriend, but the sister cut them off.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about privacy, consent, and boundaries. The author's reasoning is that the sister was being dishonest by not telling the boyfriend about her past. But the author took it upon themselves to disclose this information without the sister's permission. Even if the author believed the sister was hiding something important, sharing that information without consent could be a breach of privacy.\n\nThe sister's right to privacy vs. the author's concern about her current partner's knowledge. If the sister didn't tell the boyfriend, maybe she had her reasons\u2014maybe she felt ready to tell him on her own time, or maybe she was protecting herself. The author's action might have caused harm by revealing personal trauma without her consent, leading to the boyfriend's hostile reaction.\n\nAlso, the author's approach was direct and confrontational, which might not be the best way to handle such a sensitive issue. Instead of confronting the boyfriend, maybe the author should have talked to the sister first, encouraging her to be honest with him, rather than taking matters into their own hands.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction could be due to being surprised or feeling blindsided, which is understandable. Even if he knew, the way he reacted might have been poor, but the author's action triggered that reaction. The sister cutting off the author seems extreme, but perhaps it's because the author violated her trust.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author acted without the sister's consent, overstepped their role, and caused a breakdown in the relationship. That would place the author in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
