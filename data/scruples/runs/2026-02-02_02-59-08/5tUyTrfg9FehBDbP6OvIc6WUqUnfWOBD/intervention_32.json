I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author telling their sister's boyfriend about a traumatic past involving abuse. The key elements here are consent, privacy, and the right to share sensitive information.\n\nFirst, the sister has a history of being abused by an ex-partner. The author is concerned about the current boyfriend not knowing this. The author's parents also express uncertainty about whether the boyfriend knows. The author then takes it upon themselves to inform the boyfriend, which leads to conflict.\n\nI need to consider if the author had the right to disclose that information. The sister might have chosen to keep this private, and the author shared it without her consent. Even if the author's intentions were to protect the boyfriend, that's not the boyfriend's place to decide. The sister's autonomy in deciding who knows her past is important here.\n\nAlso, the boyfriend's reaction\u2014yelling and throwing the author out\u2014might be a result of surprise or distress. But that doesn't justify the author's actions. The author bypassed the sister's agency by not discussing it with her first. Maybe they should have encouraged her to tell him herself instead of doing it directly.\n\nThe sister cutting off the author is a consequence, but the initial action of the author was to breach confidentiality. Even if the author didn't believe the sister's claim about her agency, that's a different issue. The main point is the unauthorized disclosure. So, the author likely is in the wrong because they shared personal information without consent, violating the sister's privacy and autonomy.\n"
