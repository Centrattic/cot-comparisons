I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author told their sister's boyfriend about the sister's abusive past without her consent. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The sister had a history of being abused by a previous boyfriend who was also a pimp. The author mentioned this to their parents, who then said they weren't sure if the current boyfriend knew. The author decided to tell the boyfriend directly, which led to a confrontation where the boyfriend yelled and threw them out. The sister then cut off the author.\n\nNow, considering the ethics here. The main issue is whether the author had the right to disclose confidential information about their sister. The sister had chosen to keep her past a secret, even though it's a serious matter. The author's intention was to protect the boyfriend, thinking that knowing the history would make him reconsider the relationship. However, the sister's autonomy is important. Even if the author was concerned about their sister's well-being, sharing such personal information without consent can be seen as violating her privacy. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction was harsh, but the author's action of revealing the secret might have overstepped. The sister might feel betrayed that her personal history was shared without her permission, which could damage the relationship between the siblings. The parents' role is also a factor here, but the author's direct action is the main point. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a moral dilemma. On one hand, the author wanted to ensure the boyfriend was aware of a significant red flag. On the other hand, the sister's agency in deciding what to share about her past should be respected. The sister might be working on healing and moving forward, and the author's intervention could have set that back. \n\nSo, while the author had good intentions, the method was problematic. They didn't consult their sister first, which is a key breach of trust. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong, so the answer would be A.\n"
