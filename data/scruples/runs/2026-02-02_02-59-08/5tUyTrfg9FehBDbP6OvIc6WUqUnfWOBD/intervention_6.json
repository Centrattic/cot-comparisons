I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their sister's boyfriend about the sister's abusive past. \n\nFirst, the sister had a history of being in an abusive relationship where she was treated as a pimp's girl. The author believes the sister might not be fully honest about her role in that situation. The parents were unsure if the boyfriend knew about the abuse. The author decided to tell the boyfriend, thinking it was important for him to know given the seriousness of the relationship (marriage plans). The boyfriend reacted badly, and the sister cut off the author.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author overstepped by sharing that information. On one hand, the author might think they're protecting their sister from someone who might not handle the truth well. But on the other hand, the sister might have chosen not to share that part of her past with her boyfriend, and the author's disclosure could have violated her privacy. \n\nThe sister's reaction is also important here. She ended the relationship with the author, which suggests she felt betrayed. The boyfriend's anger might be due to being told something so personal without the sister's consent. \n\nEthically, sharing someone's private information without their permission is generally considered a breach of trust, even if the intent is good. The author might argue it's for the boyfriend's benefit to know the truth, but that's assuming the boyfriend's right to know outweighs the sister's right to privacy. However, the sister's confidentiality is typically her to manage, and the author stepping in without her consent could be seen as crossing a boundary. \n\nAdditionally, the author's doubt about the sister's agency in the past abuse is subjective. The sister might have reasons for not discussing it, and the author's judgment could cloud their actions. \n\nIn many cases, family advice is well-meaning but can lead to conflicts if not handled with care. The key here is consent and respecting the sister's autonomy in her relationships. The author might not be malicious, but the act of sharing sensitive info without permission is ethically questionable. \n\nSo, considering all these factors, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because they disclosed private information without the sister's consent, potentially harming relationships and violating trust.\n"
