I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about the author telling their sister's boyfriend about the sister's abusive past. The sister had a history with an abusive ex who was a pimp, and the author thinks the boyfriend should know because most people wouldn't date someone with that background. The author told the boyfriend, who reacted angrily, and the sister then cut off the author.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The sister might have a right to privacy regarding her past. Even though the author is concerned, sharing such personal information without consent could be a breach of trust. The sister might have chosen not to disclose that part of her history to her boyfriend, possibly for reasons the author isn't aware of, like fear of rejection or wanting to move on. The author's intention was to protect the boyfriend, but maybe the sister had her reasons for keeping it hidden.\n\nThen there's the question of the author's right to intervene. Family members often have a duty to protect each other, but there's also a line between concern and overstepping. The author might believe they're acting in the best interest of the boyfriend, but without knowing the full context of the sister's current relationship, the author's judgment could be clouded. The boyfriend's reaction could be due to surprise or distress, not necessarily because the sister withheld information maliciously.\n\nAlso, after the fallout, the sister's response to cut off the author is extreme, but maybe she felt her privacy was invaded. The author's demand for an apology might be reasonable, but the sister's reaction suggests she's hurt and possibly blames the author for interfering.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author's action was a breach of the sister's confidentiality. Even with good intentions, sharing someone else's sensitive information without their consent is generally considered wrong. The sister might have a right to decide what to share about her past. The author's intervention, while well-meaning, crossed a boundary. So the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
