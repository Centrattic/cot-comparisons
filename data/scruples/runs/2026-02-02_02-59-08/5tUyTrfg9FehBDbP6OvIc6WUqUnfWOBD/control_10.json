I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their sister's boyfriend about the sister's past abusive relationship. The sister had a history of being abused and being a pimp's victim before she came back to live with her parents. The author told the boyfriend because they felt it was wrong to hide such a major issue. The boyfriend then reacted angrily, and the sister cut off the author.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. The sister didn't disclose her past to her boyfriend. The author felt it was important for him to know, maybe because it could affect their future together, especially since they're talking about marriage. But was it the author's place to tell him? \n\nOn one hand, the sister might have her reasons for not disclosing her past. Maybe she's not ready, or maybe she's protecting herself. By the author revealing this without her consent, they might have violated her privacy. Even if the author's intentions were good, sharing someone's personal history without their permission can be a breach of trust.\n\nBut on the other hand, if the sister's past could significantly impact the relationship, especially if it affects the boyfriend's decision to marry her, the boyfriend has a right to know. However, the sister is an adult and might have the right to choose what she shares with her partner. The author's action might have been a violation of her autonomy. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction could be due to surprise and hurt, but the author's method of disclosure was direct and without the sister's consent. The sister cutting off the author suggests she was upset about the breach of trust. \n\nSo, the key points are: Did the author have the right to disclose the sister's private information? The sister didn't share it, so the author stepping in might have overstepped. Even if the intention was to protect the boyfriend, the method was problematic. The author might be in the wrong because they didn't respect the sister's privacy and autonomy in deciding what to share. However, there's an argument that the information is significant enough that the boyfriend should know. But since the sister chose not to disclose it, the author shouldn't have forced the issue. \n\nTherefore, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because they shared private information without the sister's consent, which is a breach of trust and privacy, even if the intention was good.\n"
