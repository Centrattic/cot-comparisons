I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author telling their sister's boyfriend about the sister's abusive past without the sister's consent.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications here. The sister might have chosen not to disclose her past relationship because she felt it was private or because she didn't want to burden her boyfriend. By revealing this information, the author potentially violated her confidentiality. Even if the author's intentions were to protect the boyfriend, that doesn't necessarily make it right. Trust and consent are key factors here.\n\nNext, the brother's reasoning: he thinks it's wrong for the sister to be in a relationship without the boyfriend knowing about her history. But does that justify disclosing it without her permission? Maybe not. The boyfriend's reaction (yelling and throwing him out) suggests that the information was unexpected and perhaps hurtful, which might mean the sister hadn't shared it yet. However, the brother's action led to conflict and the sister cutting him off.\n\nAnother angle is the author's uncertainty about the sister's agency in the previous situation. While that's concerning, it's not the same as the sister being currently in an abusive relationship. The author might be overstepping by assuming he knows what's best for his sister's new relationship.\n\nLegal aspects? Probably not relevant here unless there were specific laws about disclosure, which is unlikely. More about personal boundaries and trust.\n\nWhat about the family dynamics? The parents didn't seem to support the author's actions either, as they were surprised the boyfriend didn't know. The sister's response was extreme, but the author's action might have been the catalyst.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at whether the action was a violation of trust or crossed a boundary. Here, the author did both. Even if the intention was good, the method (telling the boyfriend without consent) was problematic. The author's sister now feels betrayed, leading to the fallout.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the author acted without consent, broke his sister's confidence, and caused significant conflict. His intentions might be understandable, but the action itself was a breach of trust. Therefore, he's likely in the wrong.\n"
