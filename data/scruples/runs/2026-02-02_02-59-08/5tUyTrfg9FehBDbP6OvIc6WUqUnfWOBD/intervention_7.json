I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author told their sister's boyfriend about the sister's past abuse. The sister had a history of being in an abusive relationship, where she was treated like a pimp's girl. The author thought it was wrong for the boyfriend not to know this, especially since they're planning to get married. The parents didn't know if the boyfriend was aware, so the author decided to tell him. The boyfriend reacted angrily, yelling and throwing the author out. Then the sister cut off the author.\n\nHmm, the key points here are whether the author had the right to share that information. The sister didn't disclose her past to the boyfriend, and the author believed she had some agency in that situation. The author's intention was to protect the boyfriend from being in a relationship with someone who had such a traumatic past. But the sister might feel that her privacy was violated, and the boyfriend was upset because the information was shared without his consent.\n\nOn one hand, the author might think they were doing the right thing to inform the boyfriend about something major that could affect their relationship. On the other hand, the sister might see this as an invasion of her privacy, and the boyfriend's reaction suggests he felt blindsided or disrespected.\n\nThere's also the aspect of the author questioning the sister's agency. The author isn't sure if the sister was as helpless as she claims, which might have influenced their decision to act. But sharing someone else's personal information without their consent can be problematic, regardless of the intent. The sister might have wanted to handle it herself, and the author stepping in could have caused more harm than good.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction was hostile, which could mean he felt betrayed, not because he was abusive, but because the information was given without his consent. The author might have overstepped by not discussing it with the sister first. Even if the author thought it was for the boyfriend's benefit, it's typically the person's responsibility to share their own past.\n\nIn terms of ethics, there's a balance between protecting someone from potential harm and respecting another's privacy. However, the author's action led to the sister cutting them off, and the boyfriend was upset. It's possible the author intended to help but went about it the wrong way. The sister might feel that her privacy was violated, and the boyfriend's reaction, while harsh, might be justified if he felt the information was shared without consent.\n\nSo considering all these factors, the author might be in the wrong because they disclosed private information without permission, which is a breach of trust. Even if the intention was good, the method was inappropriate. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
