I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author told their sister's boyfriend about the sister's abusive past without the sister's permission. The sister had a history of being abused by a previous partner, and the author felt that the current boyfriend shouldn't be kept in the dark about that. The author approached the boyfriend directly, which led to a confrontation and the sister cutting off the author.\n\nHmm, first, I need to consider privacy. The sister's story is deeply personal and traumatic. By sharing this information without her consent, the author might have violated her privacy. Even if the author's intention was to protect the boyfriend, the sister might have chosen to disclose her past on her own terms. The author assumed they had the right to decide when and how to share such sensitive information, which can be a big deal.\n\nThen there's the question of agency. The author isn't sure if the sister had as little agency as she claims. While that's a valid concern, it's still the sister's story to tell. The author's judgment about her past might not be accurate, and sharing it without her knowledge could lead to further trauma or stigma for her.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction was hostile, but the author might not have considered how the information would be received. Even if the boyfriend didn't know about the abuse, the way the author chose to deliver the information might have been confrontational. Approaching the boyfriend alone and not discussing it with the sister first could have made things worse.\n\nAlso, after the fallout, the author demanded an apology from the boyfriend, which led to the sister cutting them off. The sister might feel that the author betrayed her trust, and the author's insistence on an apology could have been seen as taking sides against her.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author's actions were well-intentioned but crossed a line by not respecting the sister's autonomy. The sister's experience is her to share, and the author overstepped by disclosing it without permission. The consequences show that the sister felt her privacy was invaded, leading to the breakdown of their relationship. So, while the author might have had good intentions, the action was a violation of the sister's privacy and trust. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
