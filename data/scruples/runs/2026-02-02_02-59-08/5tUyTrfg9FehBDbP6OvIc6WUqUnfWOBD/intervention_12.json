I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about the author telling their sister's boyfriend about the sister's abusive past. The sister had a previous relationship where she was abused and pimped, and now she's seriously dating someone new. The author told the boyfriend about this, which led to conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. The sister might have chosen not to share her past with her current boyfriend. By revealing this information without her consent, the author is invading her privacy. Even if the author thinks it's important for the boyfriend to know, that's a decision the sister should make on her own. The author's action breaches trust between siblings and could be seen as overstepping boundaries.\n\nThe parents' reaction is also a point. They were unsure if the boyfriend knew about the past, which suggests the sister hadn't disclosed it. The author's decision to inform the boyfriend might have been based on concern for their sister's well-being, but that doesn't justify violating her privacy without her permission. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction was aggressive, but the author might have expected a negative response. However, that doesn't make the action right. The key issue here is the lack of consent from the sister. The author should have discussed their concerns with the sister first, encouraging her to share her history if she felt comfortable. \n\nAlso, the sister's agency is in question. The author doubts how much control she had in the past situation, but that's her own narrative. The author's judgment about her past could influence their actions, leading to the decision to inform the boyfriend. However, making that call without her input is problematic.\n\nIn summary, the author's main mistake was sharing private information without the sister's consent, which is a violation of trust and privacy. Even with good intentions, the method was wrong. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong. But maybe there's a nuance if the sister's safety was at risk, but the question is about the action of sharing the information without permission. So the answer would be A.\n"
