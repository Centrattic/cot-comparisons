I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who posted the situation is at fault. The scenario involves the author telling their sister's boyfriend about the sister's past abuse. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The sister was in an abusive relationship, which was a serious issue. The author believed that the boyfriend didn't know about this history and thought it was important for him to know because it's a major factor in a serious relationship. The author's parents also seemed unsure if the boyfriend knew. \n\nThen, the author went to the boyfriend and told him the truth. The boyfriend reacted angrily, yelling and throwing them out. The sister then cut off the author. The question is whether the author did the wrong thing by disclosing this information.\n\nOn one hand, the author's intention might have been to protect their sister by ensuring the boyfriend was aware of her past, which is a valid concern. It's important that someone in a serious relationship knows about such history, especially if it affects the person's well-being. \n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't consult their sister first. The sister might have wanted to disclose that information herself on her own terms. By revealing it without her consent, the author could have violated her privacy and trust, which might explain her reaction. The sister's history of being pimped and abused is very sensitive, and the author's actions might have caused more harm by making her feel betrayed.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction could be due to surprise and stress, but the author's approach might have been abrupt. Even if the intent was good, the method could be questioned. The sister might have wanted to handle this disclosure herself, and the author's interference led to a breakdown in relationships.\n\nSo, the author's wrongness might stem from not respecting their sister's autonomy in deciding when and how to share her past. While the intention was protective, the action overstepped by not getting her consent first. Therefore, the author might be at fault for violating her privacy without her permission, even if the intention was to protect her.\n"
