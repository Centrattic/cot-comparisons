I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author told their sister's boyfriend about her past with an abusive ex. The sister had a history of being in an abusive relationship where her previous boyfriend was controlling, almost like a pimp. The author was concerned about the current boyfriend not knowing this and felt it was important for him to know because such a major issue could affect the relationship. But when the author told him, the boyfriend reacted badly, yelling and throwing them out. Then the sister cut off the author.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. On one hand, the author might feel they were protecting their sister's new partner by informing him of her past, which is a significant red flag. People usually want to know important details about someone they're in a serious relationship with, especially regarding abuse. The author's parents were unsure if the boyfriend knew, so maybe the sister had kept this secret.\n\nBut on the other hand, the author didn't consult their sister before revealing this information. Even though the sister had a bad past, sharing that information without her consent could be a violation of her privacy. The sister might have reasons for not disclosing her history, maybe she's healing, or she's trying to move on. By sharing this, the author may have caused harm to the relationship and upset their sister. The boyfriend's reaction, while harsh, could be because he felt blindsided or betrayed by the lack of communication from the sister. The author's approach might have been too direct and without considering the sister's wishes.\n\nThe sister's response cutting off the author is also a factor. It shows that the author's actions significantly impacted her relationship with the author. The author might have overstepped by not getting the sister's approval first. Even if the intention was good, the method might not be appropriate. There's a balance between protecting someone else's partner and respecting the privacy of a family member. \n\nAnother angle is the author's own doubts about their sister's account of the abuse. The author isn't sure if the sister had as little agency as she claims. That uncertainty might have influenced the decision to speak out, thinking maybe the sister is hiding something. However, that's a personal opinion and not a justification for sharing private information without consent.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the author's action was a breach of their sister's privacy. Even if the intent was to help, the method of sharing such sensitive information without the sister's consent could be seen as wrong. The sister might have wanted to disclose her past on her own terms, and the author undermined her autonomy. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong here.\n"
