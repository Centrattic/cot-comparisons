I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who posted the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation involves the author telling their sister's boyfriend about a traumatic past that the sister didn't disclose. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The sister had a history of being abused and possibly pimped by an ex-boyfriend. The author told the boyfriend about this, thinking it was important for him to know because it's a major issue that could affect their relationship. The boyfriend reacted angrily, and the sister cut off the author.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether the author had the right to disclose this information. In some contexts, sharing someone's private information without their consent can be a breach of privacy. However, the situation here involves potential harm. The author's concern is that the boyfriend might not know about the sister's past, which could affect their future together, especially since they're planning marriage.\n\nBut then there's the aspect of consent. The sister might not have wanted her boyfriend to know, so the author acted without her permission. Even if the author's intentions were to protect the boyfriend or prevent future harm, the method of disclosure without the sister's consent is problematic. \n\nAlso, the sister's reaction is extreme, but maybe she feels that her privacy was violated. The boyfriend's reaction, though harsh, might be because he felt blindsided. The author might argue that the information was necessary for the boyfriend to know, but others might see it as overstepping.\n\nAnother angle is the dynamic between family members. The author is the sibling trying to look out for their sister, but the sister's autonomy is a factor. The parents also seemed concerned about whether the boyfriend knew, which might have influenced the author's decision. However, the author's responsibility is to the sister, not the boyfriend, so sharing the information without consent could be seen as wrong.\n\nIn terms of ethics, there's a balance between protecting someone's well-being and respecting their privacy. The author might believe they were helping, but the sister's right to decide what to share about her past is important. The author's action could have caused harm by causing the relationship to end abruptly and losing contact with their sister.\n\nSo, putting this all together, the author likely overstepped by disclosing sensitive information without the sister's consent, even if they had good intentions. Therefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
