I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author telling their sister's boyfriend about the sister's past being abused and pimped. The author thought it was wrong to hide such a major issue from the boyfriend, which most guys would be concerned about. The boyfriend reacted angrily, and the sister cut off the author.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics of the author's action. The sister was in a serious relationship, and the author decided to disclose personal and sensitive information without the sister's consent. Even if the author thought the boyfriend should know, sharing someone's private history like that could be a breach of trust. The sister might have chosen not to tell the boyfriend for various reasons, maybe she's still healing, or the relationship is complicated. The author assumed their own judgment was correct, which might not be valid.\n\nBut then, there's the angle of the sister's well-being. If the boyfriend was unaware of her past and that past could impact their relationship, maybe the author had a point in wanting him to know. However, the method of disclosure was direct without consulting the sister first. That's a problem. The author didn't check with the sister if she wanted to share this information; they just went to the boyfriend. That could be seen as overstepping boundaries.\n\nAlso, the sister's reaction of cutting off the author suggests that the disclosure was taken as a betrayal. The boyfriend's anger and the sister's rejection indicate that the author's actions might have caused harm. The question is whether the author had the right to make that decision for the sister. Even if the author's intentions were good, the action was invasive. Privacy is important, and family members, while close, aren't always the right people to decide for others what information to share.\n\nOn the other hand, if the sister's past was a significant factor in the relationship's stability, maybe the author had a duty to speak up. But again, that's a big assumption. The author's uncertainty about the sister's agency in the past situation adds another layer. The author might be projecting their own judgment onto the sister, assuming she didn't have a choice when she might actually have agency. So the author's motivation might be based on their own interpretation, which isn't reliable.\n\nIn terms of the boyfriend's reaction, he was startled and angry, which could be a natural response to unexpected information. The author expected a different reaction, but people react differently. The author then demanded an apology, which the sister denied. That escalated the conflict further.\n\nConsidering all this, the author's actions were likely a violation of the sister's privacy and autonomy. Even if the intention was to protect the sister or her boyfriend, the method was incorrect. The right approach would have been to talk to the sister first, express concerns, and let her decide whether to disclose her past to her partner. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
