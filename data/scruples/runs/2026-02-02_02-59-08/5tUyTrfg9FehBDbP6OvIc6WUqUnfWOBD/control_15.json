I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is at fault here. The situation is that the sister's boyfriend was abused by her previous partner, who also acted like a pimp. The author told the boyfriend about this history without the sister's consent. The boyfriend reacted angrily and the sister cut off the author.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The author believed the boyfriend had a right to know about the sister's past, especially since they were planning marriage. But sharing personal information without permission can breach trust. The sister might feel her privacy was violated. However, the author's concern was about the boyfriend's awareness of a serious issue that could affect their relationship.\n\nOn the other hand, the sister might not have chosen to share that information, and the author stepping in could be seen as overstepping. The boyfriend's reaction was harsh, but the author's intent was to protect him from potential harm or deception. The sister cutting off the author might be an overreaction, but the author's actions could have justified some response from the sister.\n\nI should also think about consent and boundaries. The author didn't consult the sister before sharing her information. Even if the author had good intentions, the method was invasive. The sister's autonomy in deciding what to share with her partner is important. The author might not be in the wrong, but there are valid arguments on both sides. The key points are the violation of privacy versus the importance of the information shared.\n"
