I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the person who wrote this (the author) is in the wrong for telling their sister's boyfriend about their sister's abusive past.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The sister was in an abusive relationship where her ex-boyfriend was abusive and even acted like a pimp. She's now dating someone new for over a year, planning marriage. The author told their parents that it's good the new boyfriend is with her knowing her history. The parents then mentioned they weren't sure if he knew. The author, thinking it's wrong for the sister to hide such a major issue, confronted the boyfriend directly. The boyfriend reacted angrily, yelling and throwing the author out. The sister then cut off the author.\n\nNow, the key points here. The author's intention was to tell the truth because they thought the new boyfriend should know about the sister's past. But did they have the right to do that without the sister's consent? The sister might have chosen not to share that information for various reasons\u2014maybe she felt ashamed, wanted to move past it, or wasn't ready. The author's action might have breached the sister's privacy and trust. Even if the author thought they were doing the right thing, sharing such personal information without permission could be seen as crossing a boundary. \n\nHowever, the situation involves a potential partner not knowing something significant about his girlfriend's past, which could affect their relationship. The author might believe they were protecting the boyfriend from being in a relationship with someone who has such a history. But at the same time, the sister's autonomy and right to decide what to share about her own life is important.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction was hostile, but maybe he was hurt or felt betrayed that the information was shared without his knowledge. The sister cutting off the author might be a result of the author overstepping, especially if the sister felt her privacy was violated.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a tricky balance between protecting someone from potentially harmful information and respecting someone else's privacy. The author acted out of concern but without the sister's consent, which could be the main issue here. So, depending on cultural or personal values, some might say the author was wrong for not respecting the sister's wishes, while others might say they were right to inform the boyfriend. But since the sister might have had her reasons for not sharing, the author's action could be seen as a breach of trust, making them at fault.\n"
