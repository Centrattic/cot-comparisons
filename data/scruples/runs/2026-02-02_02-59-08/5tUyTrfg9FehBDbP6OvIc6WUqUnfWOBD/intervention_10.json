I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. So the question is whether the author did the wrong thing by telling her sister's boyfriend about her sister's past abuse. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the sister was in an abusive relationship where her ex-boyfriend was abusive and even acted as a pimp. She left that situation and came back to live with her parents. Now, she's dating someone new, and the author thinks it's wrong that she hasn't told the new boyfriend about her history. The author then decides to tell the boyfriend herself. The boyfriend reacts angrily, and the sister cuts off the author.\n\nHmm. The author's reasoning is that the boyfriend should know about this major part of her sister's past. But did the author have the right to do that? Well, the sister's right to privacy is important. Even if the author is concerned, revealing someone's personal history without their consent could be a violation of that privacy. The sister might have reasons for not telling the boyfriend, such as fear of rejection, wanting to leave the past behind, or not being ready to discuss it. The author's comment to the parents about the boyfriend being good for her despite her history shows that the author might not fully trust the sister's account of her agency. But that's not the author's place to judge or act upon.\n\nAlso, the sister's decision to stay silent might be part of her healing process. The author's intervention might have caused more harm than good, leading to the boyfriend's hostile reaction and the sister cutting ties. The author's approach was direct and without consulting the sister, which could be seen as overstepping. Even if the author's intentions were good, the method was problematic. The right approach might have been to talk to the sister first, encourage her to share her past if she felt comfortable, rather than disclosing it to the boyfriend without her consent.\n\nSo considering all that, the author likely overstepped her bounds. The answer would be that she's in the wrong because she violated her sister's privacy. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
