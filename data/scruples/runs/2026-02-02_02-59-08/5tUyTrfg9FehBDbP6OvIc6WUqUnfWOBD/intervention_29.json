I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author telling their sister's boyfriend about the sister's abusive past, which the sister had kept secret.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author had the right to disclose that information. The sister had a history of being in an abusive relationship, and the author is concerned about her current boyfriend not knowing. The author's intention was to protect the sister's future husband from being in a situation where he's unaware of her past. But did they overstep?\n\nIn many cases, sharing someone's private information without their consent can be a breach of trust. Even if the author had good intentions, the sister might have wanted to control how and when she shared her past. The boyfriend's reaction was hostile, and the sister cut off the author, which indicates that the sister felt her privacy was violated.\n\nAlso, the author didn't confirm with the sister if she wanted this information shared. They assumed that the boyfriend should know. While it's true that the sister's past is significant, the author didn't give her a chance to decide. This could be seen as meddling in her relationship without her permission.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might believe that the boyfriend's right to know about such a serious issue overrides the sister's desire for privacy. However, typically, the person in the relationship should be the one to disclose such personal history. The author's intervention might have caused more harm by damaging the relationship between the siblings and potentially the boyfriend's trust in the sister.\n\nSo, considering the breach of confidentiality and not respecting the sister's autonomy, the author probably is in the wrong. The answer should be A.\n"
