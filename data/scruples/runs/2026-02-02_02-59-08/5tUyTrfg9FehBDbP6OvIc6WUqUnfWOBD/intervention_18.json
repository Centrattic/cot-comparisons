I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author telling their sister's boyfriend about the sister's abusive past. \n\nFirst, the key points: The sister was in an abusive relationship where she was pimped out. The author thinks it's wrong she's hiding this from her new boyfriend. The parents didn't know if the boyfriend was aware. The author told the boyfriend, who reacted angrily. The sister then cut off the author.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. Let me consider both sides. \n\nOn one hand, the author feels they were protecting their sister by being honest, especially since the new boyfriend might not know about the abusive past. They might think transparency is important for a serious relationship. But on the other hand, the sister might have her reasons for not sharing that info yet, and the author overstepped by revealing it without her consent. \n\nThere's a conflict between family loyalty and privacy. The author's actions led to the boyfriend reacting negatively, which the sister then used as a reason to cut ties. The author's intention was to help, but they didn't consider the sister's autonomy in deciding when and how to share her past. \n\nIn terms of ethics, sharing someone's private information without their permission is generally a breach of trust. Even if the motive is good, the method might not be appropriate. The boyfriend's reaction could be due to surprise or anger, but the author's action directly caused that situation. \n\nSo, the author might have acted out of concern but without respecting their sister's boundaries. That makes them at fault for breaching confidentiality. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
