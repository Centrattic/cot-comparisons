I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) post did the wrong thing by telling their sister's boyfriend about the abuse and pimping history. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The sister was in an abusive relationship where she was manipulated and possibly abused. The author is concerned about her current boyfriend not knowing this history. The author's parents also seemed uncertain if the boyfriend was aware.\n\nThe author's main issue is that the sister is hiding her past with the previous partner. The author decided to tell the boyfriend directly. The boyfriend reacted angrily, leading to a fallout where the sister now wants no contact with the author.\n\nNow, ethical considerations. Is it right to share someone's personal history without their consent? The sister might have chosen to keep this private, maybe for reasons the author isn't aware of. Even with good intentions, the author didn't get the sister's permission. That's a big point. The author assumed they knew the sister's motivations, but the sister might have valid reasons for not disclosing, like fear of being judged or wanting to move on.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction was hostile, but that doesn't necessarily mean the author was wrong. However, the method of disclosure is questionable. Approaching the boyfriend directly without consulting the sister first could have been done in a more sensitive way, maybe by encouraging the sister to talk to him instead. \n\nAlso, the sister's response to the author cutting off contact suggests that the sister felt betrayed. The author's actions might have violated trust between siblings. Even if the author thought they were doing the right thing, they overstepped by not respecting the sister's autonomy.\n\nSo, while the author had intentions to protect the sister, the means of doing so without her consent might be considered wrong. The key point here is the lack of consent from the sister. The author acted on their own, which led to negative consequences. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
