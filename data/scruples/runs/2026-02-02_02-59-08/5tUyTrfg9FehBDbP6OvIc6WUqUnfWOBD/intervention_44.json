I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole?) post is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation here.\n\nFirst, the author's sister was in an abusive relationship where her ex-boyfriend was abusive and even acted as a pimp. The sister has since moved on and is in a serious relationship with a new boyfriend. The author told their parents that it's good the boyfriend is with her despite her history. The parents then mentioned they weren't sure if the new boyfriend knew about the abuse. The author, feeling that the sister wasn't being honest with the new guy, decided to approach the boyfriend directly and tell him about her past. The boyfriend reacted angrily, yelling and throwing the author out. The sister then cut off communication, and the author is asking if they're in the wrong.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about privacy, the right to share someone else's personal information, and the potential consequences of that action. The author's intention might have been to protect the sister's new partner from being in a relationship with someone who has a traumatic past. But did they have the right to disclose that information without the sister's consent?\n\nThe sister's history is very sensitive and personal. By sharing that with the boyfriend, the author might have violated her privacy. Even if the author's intentions were good, the sister might have chosen not to disclose that information yet, or maybe she felt ready to share it herself. The brother's decision to step in could be seen as overstepping, not respecting the sister's autonomy in her relationships.\n\nAlso, the boyfriend's reaction was negative, which suggests that the information might have been a shock to him. But the author can't know for sure if the boyfriend already knew or not. The sister's response of cutting off the author adds another layer\u2014maybe she felt her privacy was invaded by the brother's actions. \n\nIn relationships, especially those as serious as the one mentioned (talking marriage), partners should communicate about their pasts. But the sister might have chosen not to share that information with her current partner for various reasons. The author's role here was to intervene, which could be seen as meddling. The question is whether the author had the right to act as they did without the sister's consent.\n\nIn terms of ethics, sharing someone's private information without their permission is generally considered a breach of trust. Even if the author thought they were doing the right thing, they didn't have the sister's approval. The sister might have her reasons for keeping her past private, and the author's disclosure could have caused harm to both the sister and the relationship without the sister's input.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author's actions were a breach of privacy and potentially harmful. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong.\n"
