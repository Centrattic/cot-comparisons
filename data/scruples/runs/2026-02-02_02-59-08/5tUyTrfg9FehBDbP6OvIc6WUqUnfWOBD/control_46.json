I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is that the author told their sister's boyfriend about the sister's abusive past, which the sister had kept hidden. The author's parents didn't know if the boyfriend was aware of this history, and the author believed the sister was hiding this significant detail from him. The author went to the boyfriend's place and told him, which led to a confrontation where the boyfriend yelled and threw them out. The sister then cut off the author from her life after they asked for an apology from the boyfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The sister had a history of abuse and being pimped, which is a serious matter. The author is concerned about the sister's well-being and feels that the boyfriend should know this information to make an informed decision about the relationship. However, the sister might have chosen to keep this private, perhaps for her own reasons, like protecting herself or because she's in a new, serious relationship and wants to move on.\n\nThe author's intention was to protect the sister and the boyfriend by being honest. But by disclosing this information directly to the boyfriend without the sister's consent, the author might have violated her privacy. Even if the author's intentions were good, sharing someone's private information without their consent can be seen as a breach of trust, especially in a family context. The sister might feel that her autonomy was respected if she had chosen to tell the boyfriend herself, and the author stepping in could have caused unnecessary harm to her relationship.\n\nOn the other hand, the author could argue that they were trying to prevent potential harm if the boyfriend was unaware of the sister's past and might not have known how to support her properly. However, the appropriate action might have been to discuss this with the sister first, encouraging her to disclose the information to the boyfriend herself, rather than doing it directly. By taking the action they did, the author might have overstepped their boundaries, leading to the fallout described.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction was aggressive, which could indicate that he was indeed unaware and didn't handle the news well, but it's possible he had valid reasons for being upset, like feeling betrayed by the sister. The sister cutting off the author might be a result of feeling that her privacy was invaded, which could be a justified reaction.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the author's main mistake was sharing the sister's private information without her consent. While the intention was to help, the method was problematic. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because they breached the sister's confidentiality without her permission, even if their motives were good.\n"
