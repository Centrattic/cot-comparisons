I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their sister's boyfriend about the sister's abusive past. The author's sister was in an abusive relationship where the ex was like a pimp, and she's now with a new guy. The author told the boyfriend about the past, and the boyfriend reacted badly, leading to a fallout with the sister.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The sister's ex was abusive, which is a serious issue. The author is concerned about the new boyfriend not knowing this history. They might think that the new guy isn't aware and that it's important he knows for his own safety or to make an informed decision. But the sister didn't tell him, so the author took it upon themselves to inform him without her consent.\n\nNow, the key points here are consent and the right to privacy. The author didn't get permission from the sister to share her past. Even if the author's intentions were good, sharing someone's personal history without their consent can be a violation of their privacy. The sister might have reasons for not wanting to disclose that information, such as fear of judgment or not being ready to talk about it. The author's action could have caused harm by exposing their sister's trauma without her agreement.\n\nAlso, the author mentioned doubting how little agency the sister claimed in the abusive situation. This suggests the author might have their own judgments about the sister's past, which could cloud their objectivity. The author's parents were unsure if the new boyfriend knew, so the author acted on that uncertainty without verifying. The boyfriend's reaction was harsh, but that doesn't necessarily justify the author's actions. However, the author's intention was to protect the new boyfriend from potential harm, which is a valid concern.\n\nOn the other hand, the sister is now cutting off the author, which is a significant consequence. The author's action, while possibly well-intentioned, crossed a boundary by sharing personal information without consent. The right to privacy is important, and the author didn't consider the sister's autonomy in deciding what to share about her past. Even if the author believed it was in the new boyfriend's best interest, that doesn't negate the breach of trust with the sister.\n\nSo, putting this all together, the author's action was a breach of privacy and trust. The sister has the right to control her narrative, and the author didn't have the right to act on her behalf. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
