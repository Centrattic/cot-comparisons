I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that the author told their sister's boyfriend about the sister's abusive past, which they learned from their parents. The sister had kept this information from the boyfriend, and the author believed it was important for him to know. However, the boyfriend reacted angrily, and the sister cut off the author.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The sister had a history of abuse, which is a significant detail in a relationship. The author's intention was to inform the boyfriend about something that could affect their relationship. But did the author overstep by not letting the sister decide whether to disclose it? The sister might have had her reasons for not telling him, maybe to protect herself or the relationship. The author decided to take the matter into their own hands, which could be seen as meddling.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend's reaction was harsh\u2014yelling and throwing the author out. That seems excessive, but maybe he felt betrayed or that the author invaded their privacy. The sister cutting off the author is also a strong reaction, possibly because she felt her autonomy was disrespected. The author might have good intentions, but the method of disclosure without the sister's consent could be problematic. There's a balance between protecting someone and respecting another person's privacy. The author's right to intervene versus the sister's right to control her own narrative is key here.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting the sister's boundaries. However, if the sister's situation is truly dangerous and the author had a genuine concern for her well-being, there's a case for the author acting in good faith. But generally, it's considered appropriate to let individuals decide when and how to share personal information, unless there's an immediate risk. Since the author isn't a professional and the situation isn't an emergency, their actions could be seen as overstepping. So, leaning towards the author being in the wrong, but there are nuances. The answer might be A (Yes), but I need to check if there's a point where it's justified. However, since the sister's choice to withhold information is her right, the author intervening without her consent likely makes them the asshole.\n"
