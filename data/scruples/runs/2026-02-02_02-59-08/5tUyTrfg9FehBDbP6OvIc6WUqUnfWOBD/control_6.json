I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author did something wrong by telling their sister's boyfriend about the sister's past abuse. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The sister was in an abusive relationship where her ex was a pimp. She's now with a new boyfriend, and the author thinks it's wrong that she hasn't told him. The author tells the boyfriend, leading to a conflict.\n\nThe main ethical points here are confidentiality and the right to privacy versus the duty to protect someone from potential harm. The author believes the boyfriend should know the sister's past to make an informed decision about his relationship. However, the sister might have chosen not to disclose that information for various reasons\u2014maybe she's not ready, or she's trying to move on.\n\nThe author's intention was to act in the sister's future well-being by ensuring the boyfriend is aware of her history. But by doing so without the sister's consent, the author breached her confidentiality. Even if the intention is good, sharing someone's personal trauma without their permission can be seen as a violation of trust. \n\nAdditionally, the sister's reaction\u2014cutting off the author\u2014shows that the disclosure caused significant harm to their relationship. The boyfriend's anger might be a result of the unexpected information, but the author didn't consider the sister's autonomy in deciding when and how to share her story. \n\nThere's also the aspect of the author's own assumptions. The author isn't sure if the sister had agency in her past situation, which might mean they're projecting their own judgments onto her. This could cloud their judgment about what's appropriate to disclose.\n\nIn many cases, respecting someone's privacy is crucial, especially regarding sensitive personal issues. Unless there's a clear and imminent danger (which isn't stated here), the author overstepped by not consulting the sister first. The right to self-determination in relationships includes deciding what to share with a partner. \n\nSo, while the author's intention was noble, the method was flawed. The sister's right to control her narrative was compromised. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong here.\n"
