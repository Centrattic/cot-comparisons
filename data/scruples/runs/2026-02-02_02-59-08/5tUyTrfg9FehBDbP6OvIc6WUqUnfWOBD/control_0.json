I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation involves the author telling their sister's boyfriend about her past abuse. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The sister had a history of being in an abusive relationship, possibly with pimping, and is now in a serious relationship. The author believes the sister is hiding this past from her current boyfriend. They mention that the parents also weren't sure if the boyfriend knew. The author decided to tell the boyfriend the truth, which led to a hostile reaction from the boyfriend and a fallout with the sister.\n\nNow, ethical considerations. The author's intent was to protect their sister's future partner by revealing potentially important information. However, they bypassed the sister's consent. Even if the author thinks the sister's account of her abuse might not be accurate (they're unsure about her agency), they still took it upon themselves to disclose this without her permission.\n\nConfidentiality and boundaries are important here. Family members often have a right to privacy. By sharing this information without the sister's consent, the author violated her trust. The sister might have reasons for not disclosing her past, such as fear of judgment, stigma, or wanting to move on. The author's actions could have caused harm by exposing her without considering her wishes.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction is understandable if he felt blindsided, but the author's approach was aggressive. They could have approached it differently, maybe by discussing it with the sister first or seeking professional help. Instead, they took a direct and confrontational route, which led to conflict.\n\nThe sister cutting off the author is a strong reaction, but it shows the impact of the author's actions. The author might not be in the wrong if the intent was to protect the boyfriend from being deceived, but they crossed ethical boundaries by not respecting the sister's autonomy. The line between protecting someone and respecting someone's privacy is thin here. The author's lack of certainty about the sister's past agency also complicates things, but that doesn't justify the disclosure without consent.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's intention might have been to help, the method was flawed. They should have handled it differently, perhaps by encouraging the sister to come forward herself rather than doing it for her. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
