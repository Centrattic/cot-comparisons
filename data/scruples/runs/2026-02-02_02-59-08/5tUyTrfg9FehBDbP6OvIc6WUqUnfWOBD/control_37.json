I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story (the author) did the wrong thing by telling their sister's boyfriend about the sister's abusive history. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The sister was in an abusive relationship where she was pimped out. The author feels that the current boyfriend should know this because it's a major red flag. The parents didn't know if the boyfriend was aware, so the author decided to inform him directly. The boyfriend's reaction was hostile, leading to the author being thrown out. The sister then cut off the author.\n\nNow, the key points here: The author's intention was to protect their sister by ensuring the boyfriend knew her past. However, the sister might have considered this information private. The author's action might have breached the sister's confidentiality without her consent. \n\nIn terms of ethics, sharing someone's private information without their permission can be seen as a violation of trust, even if the intention was good. The author might have assumed they were acting in the sister's best interest, but they didn't consult her first. The boyfriend's reaction could be due to being surprised, but the author's method of disclosure might have been confrontational.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's concern is valid. The boyfriend being unaware of such a significant part of the sister's history could affect their relationship. However, the right way to handle this would be to talk to the sister first, not go straight to the boyfriend. The sister might have her reasons for not disclosing the past, even if the author disagrees.\n\nThe sister's reaction\u2014cutting off the author\u2014suggests that the author overstepped. The author might have intended to help but caused harm by not respecting the sister's privacy and autonomy. \n\nSo, considering all angles, the author's action was a breach of trust without consent, leading to negative consequences. Therefore, the answer is likely that the author is in the wrong.\n"
