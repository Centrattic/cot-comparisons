I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author telling their sister's boyfriend about their sister's abusive past. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The sister was in an abusive relationship with her ex, which included being pimped. The author believes the sister might be downplaying her agency in that situation. The parents didn't know if the new boyfriend was aware of this history. The author thought it was wrong to hide such a major issue from him, so they told him directly. The boyfriend reacted angrily, yelling and throwing the author out. The sister then cut off the author.\n\nThe question is whether the author was wrong to do this. I need to consider confidentiality and the right to privacy. The sister didn't share her history with her boyfriend, so the author disclosing it without her consent might be an invasion of her privacy. Even if the author had good intentions, sharing someone's personal trauma without their permission is generally not acceptable. The author might have believed they were helping, but they didn't get the sister's consent. The boyfriend's reaction could be due to being shocked, but the author's action was still a breach of trust. The sister's response is understandable given the betrayal. So, the author likely overstepped by not respecting the sister's privacy. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
