I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their sister's boyfriend about the sister's past abusive relationship. \n\nFirst, the sister had a history of being in an abusive relationship with her ex-boyfriend, who was a pimp. The author believed that her current boyfriend might not know this, given the parents mentioned they weren't sure. The author thought it was wrong for the sister to be in a serious relationship while hiding such a significant part of her past. So, they decided to tell the boyfriend directly.\n\nNow, the key points here are consent and trust. The sister didn't share her past with her boyfriend, so the author took it upon themselves to disclose it without the sister's permission. Even if the author's intention was to protect the boyfriend from being misled, they crossed a boundary by sharing private information. The sister might have valid reasons for not disclosing her past, perhaps she's not ready or wants to move on. The author's action could be seen as violating her privacy and autonomy.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction was negative and aggressive, leading to the sister cutting off the author. The author then demanded an apology, which the sister refused. The author's approach might have been well-intentioned, but the method was problematic. They didn't consider the sister's right to control her own narrative or the potential consequences of their disclosure. \n\nIn terms of the boyfriend's reaction, it's possible he was hurt or shocked, but yelling and throwing the author out was inappropriate. However, the author's initial action of disclosing without consent still places the burden on them. Ethically, people have a right to privacy, especially regarding personal and traumatic experiences. Unless there was a legal obligation or imminent danger, the author shouldn't have shared that information without the sister's permission.\n\nSo, even if the author thought they were doing the right thing, the action was a breach of trust. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
