I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who told their sister's boyfriend about her past is in the wrong. The sister had a history of being in an abusive relationship where she was pimped and then came back to live with her parents. The author thought it was wrong for her sister to be in a serious relationship without the boyfriend knowing about that history. After a conversation with parents, they found out the boyfriend might not know, so they told him. The boyfriend reacted angrily, and the sister cut off the author.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's intentions. The author believed the boyfriend should know because it's a major part of the sister's past. But did they have the right to disclose that information? Privacy is a big factor here. Even if the author thought it was for the sister's good, sharing someone else's personal history without their consent can be problematic. The sister might have moved on and chosen to start fresh, so revealing the past might have violated her privacy.\n\nThen there's the method of disclosure. The author confronted the boyfriend directly without discussing it with the sister first. This approach could have been hurtful and invasive. The sister might have wanted to share her past on her own terms, but the author decided to do it for her. That could be seen as overstepping boundaries.\n\nAlso, the boyfriend's reaction was defensive, but that doesn't necessarily mean he was right. However, the author's actions led to a breakdown in the sister's relationship with them. The sister cutting off contact shows the impact of the author's actions. The sister might feel betrayed by her sibling's decision to share her secrets.\n\nOn the other hand, the author was concerned about their sister's well-being. They might have believed the boyfriend wasn't aware of the abuse and that the sister was in a risky situation again. But even with good intentions, the approach taken was problematic. The right to privacy and autonomy is important; the sister should have the right to choose who to disclose her past to.\n\nSo considering all these points, the author did overstep by sharing personal information without consent, leading to negative consequences. Therefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
