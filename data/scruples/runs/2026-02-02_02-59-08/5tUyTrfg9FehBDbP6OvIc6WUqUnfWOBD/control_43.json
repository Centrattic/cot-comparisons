I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who told their sister's boyfriend about the sister's past is in the wrong. So, the sister was in an abusive relationship where her ex was like a pimp. The author feels that the boyfriend should know this because it's a major issue that might affect their relationship. The parents didn't know if the boyfriend was aware, so the author decided to tell him. The boyfriend then reacted angrily, and the sister cut off the author.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the sister's privacy. The sister might have chosen not to share her past, so the author disclosing that information without her consent could be a violation of trust. Even if the author's intentions were good, sharing such personal details without the sister's permission is a big deal. The boyfriend's reaction was harsh, but maybe that's because he wasn't ready to hear it. The author's action might have overstepped, even if they thought they were helping.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might believe they're protecting their sister by ensuring the boyfriend is aware of her history. But, the sister might see it as her own business and not the author's to share. The author's approach could have been more diplomatic, like talking to the sister first to see if she wanted to tell the boyfriend herself. Without that, the author's action could be seen as meddling. So, even if the intention was good, the method was problematic. The answer might be that the author is in the wrong because they didn't respect their sister's privacy and autonomy in deciding what to share.\n"
