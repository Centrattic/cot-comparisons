I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking whether the author did the wrong thing by telling their sister's boyfriend about her past. \n\nFirst, the sister had a history of being in an abusive relationship, even being pimped by an ex. The author is concerned because the sister is now in a serious relationship and might be hiding this past from her new boyfriend. The author's parents didn't know if the boyfriend was aware, so the author decided to tell him. The boyfriend's reaction was hostile, leading to a breakdown in communication with the sister.\n\nThe key points here are privacy, consent, and the author's intentions. The sister might have chosen not to share her history, and the author went against her wishes by disclosing it. Even if the author's intentions were good\u2014thinking it's important for the boyfriend to know\u2014it's a sensitive topic. The sister's autonomy to decide what to share about her own life is crucial here. \n\nAlso, the author didn't consider how the information might affect the relationship. The boyfriend's negative reaction could be due to the way the truth was presented, not just the content. The author didn't give the sister a chance to handle it on her own, which might have been the more respectful approach.\n\nSo, while the author might have thought they were helping, they overstepped by revealing personal information without the sister's consent. That makes them at fault.\n"
