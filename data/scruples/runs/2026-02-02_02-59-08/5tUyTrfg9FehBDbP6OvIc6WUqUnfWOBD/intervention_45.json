I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about the author telling their sister's boyfriend about the sister's past abuse and pimping. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The sister has a history of being abused and possibly pimped by her previous partner. The author's parents didn't tell the current boyfriend, so the author took it upon themselves to do so. The boyfriend reacted angrily, and the sister now is cutting off the author.\n\nThe key points here are privacy, intent, and boundaries. The author's intention might have been to protect their sister or the boyfriend from potential harm, but did they cross a line by sharing that information without consent? The sister might have chosen not to disclose her past to her current partner for various reasons\u2014maybe she felt ready to move on, or she feared rejection. By revealing this to the boyfriend, the author could be undermining her autonomy.\n\nHowever, there's a concern about the sister's safety. If the new boyfriend didn't know about her past, maybe there's a risk he could be unaware of red flags. But the way the author approached it\u2014by confronting the boyfriend directly without talking to the sister first\u2014might have been a breach of trust. The sister might have wanted to handle it herself, or perhaps she wasn't ready to disclose it yet.\n\nAlso, the author's comment about not believing the sister's claim of having little agency is a bit concerning. That suggests the author might not fully trust their sister's account of her past, which could imply judgment rather than support. \n\nIn terms of boundaries, siblings have a right to privacy, especially regarding such personal and traumatic experiences. The author's action might have violated that boundary, even if the intention was good. The boyfriend's negative reaction and the sister cutting off the author could be consequences of that breach.\n\nSo, weighing the intent versus the action, the author might be in the wrong because they shared private information without consent, potentially harming relationships and not respecting their sister's autonomy. Even with good intentions, the method used could be problematic. Therefore, the answer might be A.\n"
