I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who told their sister's boyfriend about the abusive past is in the wrong. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the sister has a history of abuse by a former boyfriend. The author thinks it's wrong that the sister is keeping this secret from her new boyfriend, who they've been dating for over a year and are serious about marriage. The author tells the boyfriend the truth, which leads to a confrontation where the boyfriend yells and throws them out. Then the sister cuts off the author.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author overstepped by sharing the information without the sister's consent. On one hand, the author might believe they're helping by making sure the boyfriend knows the truth, which is important for a serious relationship. On the other hand, the sister might have chosen not to disclose that part of her past, and the author disclosing it without her permission could be seen as violating her privacy.\n\nI need to consider the ethics here. Usually, people have a right to keep their past private, unless there's an immediate risk to someone else. The author's concern is valid because the sister's past could impact the current relationship. However, sharing personal information without consent can be a breach of trust, even if the intention is good.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction could be due to surprise, but maybe he had no idea, which the author didn't know. The sister's cutting off the author is a strong reaction, but maybe she feels her privacy was invaded. The author might have thought they were doing the right thing by being honest, but without the sister's permission, it's a gray area. \n\nIn many cases, family advice is to let the individual decide what to share about their own life. The author might have acted out of concern but overstepped by not discussing it with the sister first. So, depending on the context, the author could be in the wrong for not respecting the sister's autonomy in sharing her own history.\n"
