I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about telling a sister's boyfriend about a traumatic event in the sister's past. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The sister's ex-boyfriend was abusive and acted like a pimp. The writer's sister is now in a serious relationship with a new guy, and the writer thought it was wrong for the sister to keep this history secret. The writer told the boyfriend about it without consulting the sister, leading to a confrontation where the boyfriend yelled and kicked the writer out. The sister then cut off communication.\n\nHmm, so the main issue is whether the writer overstepped by sharing private information without consent. The sister might have chosen not to tell her current boyfriend for various reasons\u2014maybe she's not ready, maybe it's a sensitive topic, or perhaps she's trying to move on. The writer's intention was to protect the boyfriend by informing him of the sister's history, but did they have the right to do that without the sister's permission?\n\nOn one hand, the writer believes the boyfriend should know because it's a significant part of the sister's past that could affect their relationship. On the other hand, the sister's privacy and autonomy are important. The writer didn't discuss this with the sister first, which might have been a better approach. Even if the writer was concerned, sharing such personal information without consent could be seen as violating trust.\n\nAlso, the boyfriend's reaction was defensive and hostile. Maybe he didn't know, or maybe he felt blindsided. But the writer's method of revealing it might have been abrupt, causing unnecessary conflict. The sister cutting off the writer shows the impact of the writer's actions on their relationship.\n\nThe question is whether the writer was in the wrong. If the sister didn't want the information to be shared, then the writer's action could be considered a breach of privacy. The writer might have thought they were doing the right thing, but without the sister's consent, it's a violation of her autonomy. So, the answer is likely A (yes, the writer is in the wrong) because they disclosed personal information without permission, which is a breach of trust and privacy.\n"
