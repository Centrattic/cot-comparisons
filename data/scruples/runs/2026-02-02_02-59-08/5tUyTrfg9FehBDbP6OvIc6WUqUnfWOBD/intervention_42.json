I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves the writer telling their sister's boyfriend about the sister's abusive past. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The sister was in an abusive relationship where she was pimped out, and she's now dating someone new. The writer told the boyfriend about this history without the sister's consent. The parents also didn't know if the boyfriend knew, so the writer took it upon themselves to inform him. The boyfriend reacted angrily, and the sister is upset with the writer.\n\nSo, the main issues here are privacy and consent. The sister didn't share her history with her current boyfriend, and the writer assumed it was their responsibility to do so. Even if the writer believes their sister's account isn't entirely accurate, they didn't get permission to share that information. The boyfriend's reaction suggests he was blindsided, which might be valid if the sister didn't disclose it. However, the writer's action crossed a privacy boundary. \n\nEven if the writer's intentions were to protect their sister or the boyfriend from potential issues, sharing such sensitive information without consent is a breach of trust. The sister's right to privacy is important, and the writer didn't consider that she might have her reasons for not disclosing the past. The sister's reaction of cutting off the writer is her response to this breach, which is extreme but understandable given the invasion of privacy. \n\nSo, considering all that, the writer acted without consent and overstepped by sharing personal information that didn't directly concern them. Therefore, the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
