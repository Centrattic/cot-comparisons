I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user wants to know if the author of the \"AITA\" post did the wrong thing by telling her sister's boyfriend about the abuse history.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The sister was in an abusive relationship with a previous boyfriend, who was her pimp. She's now with this new guy, and the author feels that keeping this from him is a big deal. The author told the boyfriend, who reacted angrily. Now, the sister is cutting off the author.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether the author had the right to disclose such personal information. On one hand, the author is concerned about her sister's well-being and the new boyfriend's knowledge of the history. On the other hand, the sister might feel that the author overstepped by sharing this without her consent.\n\nI should think about privacy and consent. The sister might have chosen to keep her past private, and the author's action could be seen as violating that privacy. Even if the author had good intentions, sharing such sensitive information without the sister's permission could be problematic. However, the author is also concerned about the new boyfriend being in a relationship without full knowledge of her history, especially since they're talking about marriage.\n\nBut here's the thing: the sister's agency is in question. The author isn't sure if the sister was as passive as she claims in the previous abuse. If the sister is now with someone and hasn't disclosed her past, maybe the author felt it was necessary to protect the new boyfriend. However, that's a big assumption. The author might be projecting her own doubts onto the situation.\n\nAlso, the boyfriend's reaction was hostile. He might have felt blindsided, which could indicate that the sister didn't tell him, but the author's method of disclosure could have been confrontational. It's possible the author didn't have the right to share this information without the sister's approval, regardless of intent.\n\nIn terms of relationships, people have a right to privacy, and family dynamics can be complex. The author might have thought she was helping, but without consulting the sister first, she might have crossed a line. The sister's response was extreme, but it's clear that the author's action caused a rift.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author's intentions were to protect the new boyfriend, but the action of disclosing without consent was a breach of trust. Even if the intention was good, the method was invasive. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because she didn't respect her sister's decision to keep that information private.\n"
