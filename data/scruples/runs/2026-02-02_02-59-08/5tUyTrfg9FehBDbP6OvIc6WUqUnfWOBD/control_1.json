I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about their sister who had a bad experience with an ex who was abusive and controlling. The sister is now in a serious relationship with someone new, and the author thought it was important for the new boyfriend to know about her past. They told him, which led to a big fallout.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's intentions. They mentioned that their sister was hiding something major, which could affect the new relationship. The author believes that most people would be concerned if they knew about her history. So, the author's motivation was to be honest and protect the new boyfriend from potential issues. But was it their place to intervene?\n\nThen there's the sister's part. She was hiding her past from the boyfriend. That's a significant thing to withhold, especially in a serious relationship. The author's parents even said they weren't sure if the boyfriend knew. So, maybe the sister wasn't being honest with her partner, which could be a problem.\n\nThe author decided to tell the boyfriend directly. The boyfriend reacted angrily, but maybe that's because he was shocked or hurt. However, the author's action led to the sister cutting them out of her life. But was the author overstepping? They might have a point in wanting the boyfriend to know, but maybe they should have approached it differently, like talking to the sister first instead of going straight to the boyfriend.\n\nAlso, the sister's past is sensitive. The author isn't entirely sure if the sister's account of her lack of agency is accurate. That's a complex issue. If the sister was involved in something she's not taking responsibility for, then the boyfriend has a right to know. But the author's judgment about her sister's accountability might not be their place to assess.\n\nIn terms of ethics, there's a balance between honesty and respecting privacy. The author's intentions were to be truthful, but they might have violated the sister's privacy by revealing personal information without her consent. However, if the sister was being deceptive, maybe the author had a duty to inform the boyfriend.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction was harsh, but maybe he felt betrayed by the sister for not telling him himself, or he felt the author was intrusive. The author's action caused a breakdown in family relationships, which is a consequence they might not have anticipated.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't get the sister's permission to share such sensitive information. Even if the sister was hiding something, the author's method of disclosure might have been inappropriate. On the other hand, if the sister was being dishonest, the author's action could be seen as protecting the boyfriend. But given the outcome, the author's approach likely caused more harm than good, so they might be at fault.\n"
