I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to sleep in separate rooms. The author explains they're a light sleeper and their fianc\u00e9 is a heavy one who snores and watches TV loudly at night. The fianc\u00e9 even adjusts the volume sometimes, but the author can't take the noise anymore. They've been together 8 years with two kids, so this has been going on a long time.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's right to have a good night's sleep is important for their health and well-being. Chronic sleep issues can lead to stress, health problems, and affect their ability to care for the kids. Communication is key in relationships, but if they've tried to compromise (like lowering the volume) and it's still not working, maybe there's a bigger issue.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9's perspective is that sharing a bed is important for their relationship. But if the environment is causing significant distress, that's a problem too. The author's solution is to sleep separately, which is a common issue in marriages and relationships. Some couples do this for various reasons like snoring or work shifts. It's not about being wrong; it's about mutual respect for each other's needs.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9's reaction seems to be about the symbolism of not sharing a bed, but the author's need for rest is practical. The author has tried to compromise, but it's not working. So, the decision to sleep separately might be necessary for their well-being. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
