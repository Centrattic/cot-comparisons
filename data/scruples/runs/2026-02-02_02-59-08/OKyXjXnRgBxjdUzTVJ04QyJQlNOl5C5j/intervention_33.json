I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for suggesting they sleep in separate rooms. The situation is that the author (fianc\u00e9) is a light sleeper and their fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper who uses the TV loudly at night. The author has been putting up with this for eight years, which is a long time.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author wants a good night's sleep, which is a valid need. The fianc\u00e9's habits are causing significant disturbances. The author mentions that they've been dealing with this for years, which suggests chronic issues. The fianc\u00e9's argument is that sleeping separately would make them just roommates, implying that sharing a bed is important for their relationship.\n\nNow, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, wanting to sleep in a separate room to get rest is understandable. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 is asserting that this would undermine their relationship. But the author has tried to communicate and compromise (like lowering the TV volume a bit), but it's not enough. The fianc\u00e9's response seems to be more about the symbolic aspect of being a couple rather than addressing the practical issue of the author's sleep quality.\n\nIn relationships, both partners' needs should be considered. If one person's needs are consistently being ignored for a long time, it's reasonable to seek alternatives. The author isn't just being selfish; they're trying to resolve a problem that affects their health and well-being. The fianc\u00e9's heavy snoring and loud TV usage are legitimate issues that can't be easily solved. Suggesting separate rooms might be a practical solution to maintain both their relationship and their health.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They're trying to address a long-standing problem that's affecting their quality of life. The fianc\u00e9's reaction is more about the relationship dynamic, but the author's need for rest is just as important. Therefore, the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
