I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who posted the situation is at fault. The scenario is about a fianc\u00e9 suggesting they sleep in separate rooms because their partner's sleep habits are causing them distress.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author is a light sleeper and can't handle the noise from the TV and their partner's snoring. The fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper who needs the TV on loud. They've been together for a long time and have kids, so this is a significant issue affecting their marriage.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they're trying to get a good night's sleep, which is a basic need. The fianc\u00e9's habits are impacting that. The author tried to compromise by having the volume lowered a bit, but it's still problematic. The fianc\u00e9's response is emotional, arguing that sleeping apart would make them just roommates. But the author's main point is about their well-being. \n\nSleep is crucial for health. Chronic lack of sleep can lead to various issues. The author isn't trying to push the fianc\u00e9 away but to find a solution. The fianc\u00e9's argument seems more about the relationship dynamic than the actual problem. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author could explore other solutions first, like earplugs or a white noise machine. But the fianc\u00e9 already tried that? The post mentions that the fianc\u00e9 can't hear the TV if it's turned down, even in sleep. So maybe there's a deeper issue here, like the fianc\u00e9 possibly having sleep apnea, which could be addressed medically. \n\nHowever, the author's request to sleep separately is reasonable if all else fails. It's not about wanting to leave the relationship but about cohabiting in a way that respects both needs. The fianc\u00e9's reaction seems dismissive of the author's needs. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They're seeking a solution to a valid problem. The answer should be B (No).\n"
