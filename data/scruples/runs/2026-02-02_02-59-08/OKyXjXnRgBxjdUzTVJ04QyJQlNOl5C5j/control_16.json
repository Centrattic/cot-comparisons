I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for suggesting they sleep in separate rooms. The situation is about a long-term engaged couple with two kids. The author is a light sleeper and their fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper who watches loud action movies on TV at night. The fianc\u00e9 also snores loudly and insists on having the TV on. The author finally had enough and wants to sleep in separate rooms, but the fianc\u00e9 is upset, thinking it's bad for their relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's main issue is their inability to get a good night's sleep due to the noise. Chronic sleep deprivation can have serious health effects, so this is a valid concern. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9's habits are deeply ingrained, and he might be used to that routine. He might not realize how disruptive it is. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The fianc\u00e9's behavior is causing significant distress. The author has tried to communicate and compromise, like mentioning the TV volume, but it's not working. The engagement period has been long, and the author has been dealing with this for years. The solution of separate rooms is a drastic step, but it's a reasonable option when all other compromises fail. \n\nSome might argue that sleeping apart could affect the relationship, but others might say that respecting each other's needs is crucial. The author's health and well-being are important. Since the fianc\u00e9 isn't willing to change his habits despite the impact on the author, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for seeking a solution. So, the answer is B (No).\n"
