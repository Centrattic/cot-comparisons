I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for suggesting they sleep in separate rooms. The situation is that the fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper, watches loud TV shows at night, and the author is a light sleeper affected by that. They've been dealing with this for years and finally suggested separate rooms. The fianc\u00e9 is upset, thinking it's the end of the relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author wants a good night's sleep, which is a basic need. Chronic lack of sleep can affect health and mood. The fianc\u00e9's habits are causing ongoing issues. But the author is an engaged partner with kids, so this isn't just about a roommate situation. The fianc\u00e9's argument that if they can't share a bed, what's the point of being a couple, suggests he sees shared living as part of being a couple. However, the author's need for rest is valid. \n\nIn relationships, compromise is key. The fianc\u00e9 has made some adjustments (lowering the volume a bit) but not enough. The author tried to communicate and reached a breaking point. The question is whether suggesting separate rooms is a reasonable solution. In some cases, people have different sleeping needs, and splitting rooms isn't uncommon for health reasons. The fianc\u00e9's reaction seems to be about the symbolism of separating rather than the practicality. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because they're prioritizing their well-being. It's reasonable to seek a solution that works for both, and if the fianc\u00e9 can't adjust further, separate rooms might be necessary. The fianc\u00e9's argument that it undermines the relationship seems less valid compared to the author's health and need for rest.\n"
