I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for suggesting to their fianc\u00e9 that they sleep in separate rooms. The main issue here is their sleep habits. The fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper, snorts loudly, and watches TV at a high volume. The author is a light sleeper and can't handle the noise. After 8 years together with kids, they're frustrated and want to sleep separately.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate both sides. The author has a legitimate problem with their sleep being disturbed every night. Chronic lack of good sleep can lead to health issues, so their concern is valid. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9's habits are a long-standing issue. Maybe he's not aware of how disruptive it is, or maybe he's tried to compromise (like lowering the volume a bit). \n\nThe author's solution is to sleep in separate rooms. That's a drastic step, but considering the duration and the stress it's causing, maybe it's necessary. The fianc\u00e9 is upset, thinking it's a sign of not wanting to be a couple anymore. However, the author's main goal is to get rest, not to end the relationship. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, communication is key in relationships. The author did suggest it after trying to cope for years. Maybe they could have tried more compromises first, like using earplugs, white noise machines, or adjusting the TV setup. But if those haven't worked, and the sleep deprivation is affecting their well-being, then suggesting separate rooms isn't unreasonable. \n\nSo, I think the author isn't in the wrong. They have a valid need for a good night's sleep, and the fianc\u00e9's habits are a significant factor. The answer should be B, not in the wrong.\n"
