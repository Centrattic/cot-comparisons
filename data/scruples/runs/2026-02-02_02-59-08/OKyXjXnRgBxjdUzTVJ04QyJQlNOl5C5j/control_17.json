I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for suggesting they sleep in separate rooms. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe author is engaged, has two kids, and has been with their fianc\u00e9 for 8 years, engaged for a year. They mention being a light sleeper and the fianc\u00e9 being a heavy sleeper with loud snoring and watching TV loud at night. The fianc\u00e9 sometimes lowers the volume a bit but not enough. The author is tired of the bad sleep and decided to sleep separately. The fianc\u00e9 is upset, saying it's like being roommates.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's right to have a good night's sleep is important. Chronic sleep issues can affect health and relationships. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9's habits are a long-standing issue, and moving to separate rooms might feel like a big step. The fianc\u00e9's reaction is about the emotional aspect of the relationship, implying that not sharing a bed might be a dealbreaker.\n\nBut the author has been dealing with this for years. They've tried compromising (like adjusting the TV volume slightly), but it's not enough. The author's decision is to prioritize their health and well-being, which is valid. The fianc\u00e9's argument that they could just be roommates is a bit dismissive of the author's needs. Relationships require compromise on both sides. If the fianc\u00e9 is unwilling to make significant changes to accommodate the author's sleep needs, maybe the problem isn't just about the sleep but about communication or respect for each other's needs.\n\nLooking at the details, the author isn't trying to push the fianc\u00e9 out but is seeking a solution to a problem that's been ongoing. The fianc\u00e9's reaction seems more about the emotional impact rather than addressing the practical issue. The author's request for a good night's sleep is reasonable, and the fianc\u00e9's habits are affecting not just the author's sleep but possibly their health and ability to function.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, people often adjust to each other's quirks in a long-term relationship. However, there's a limit when it affects basic needs like sleep. The author might not be in the wrong here because they're asking for a solution that benefits both their health and the relationship's stability in the long run. The fianc\u00e9 might need to find a way to reduce noise, maybe through earplugs, white noise machines, or medical advice for snoring. But the author is justified in seeking a solution when all else has failed.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). They're seeking a reasonable compromise for a valid reason.\n"
