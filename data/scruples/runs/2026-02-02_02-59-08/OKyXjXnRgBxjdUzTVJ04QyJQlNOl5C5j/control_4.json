I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the fianc\u00e9 suggests sleeping in separate rooms because the other partner is a heavy sleeper, watches loud TV shows, and it's affecting their sleep. The fianc\u00e9 argues that if they can't share a bed, what's the point of being a couple instead of roommates.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is a light sleeper and has tried to compromise by the fianc\u00e9 lowering the volume a bit, but it's still causing sleep issues. They've been together for 8 years with two kids, so this has been a long-term problem. The fianc\u00e9, on the other hand, is a heavy sleeper and relies on the TV for sleep. He sees separate rooms as making them just roommates, which he's against.\n\nThe key points here are about mutual respect and finding solutions. The author wants a good night's sleep, which is reasonable. Chronic sleep deprivation can affect health and relationships. The fianc\u00e9's habits are causing this problem. However, suggesting separate rooms might seem like a drastic step. But given the long duration and the fact that the author has tried to compromise (like the fianc\u00e9 lowering the volume slightly), maybe the author is justified. The fianc\u00e9's response about being roommates might be dismissive of the author's legitimate need for rest. \n\nAlso, the author's reasoning is about their well-being. If the fianc\u00e9 can't adjust further (like using earplugs, white noise machines, or changing his TV habits), then separate rooms might be a necessary compromise. Relationships require both partners to make adjustments. If one side has already made efforts and the other isn't meeting them halfway, the first partner isn't necessarily in the wrong. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
