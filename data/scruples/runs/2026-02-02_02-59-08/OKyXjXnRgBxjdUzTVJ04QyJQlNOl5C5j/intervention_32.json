I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is engaged to someone and wants to sleep in separate rooms because their fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper, watches loud movies on TV, and it's affecting their sleep. The fianc\u00e9 is against the idea, thinking it's just like being roommates.\n\nHmm. The author has been dealing with this for 8 years, engaged for a year, and has two kids. They mention that they've had bad sleep for a long time. The fianc\u00e9, on the other hand, is a heavy sleeper and needs the TV on loud. The author tried to compromise by asking him to lower the volume, but he still can't hear it even when it's down a bit. Now the author is suggesting separate rooms, which the fianc\u00e9 is against.\n\nSo, who's in the wrong here? Well, the author is trying to get some rest. Sleep is important for health, especially with kids. The fianc\u00e9's habits are causing a problem. But splitting into separate rooms might feel like a big step. The author might be justified because they're prioritizing their health and well-being. However, maybe they could have tried other solutions first, like earplugs or a white noise machine. But the fianc\u00e9's behavior is pretty extreme\u2014watching loud action movies every night and not being able to adjust. It's possible the author is right to take action, especially if they've already tried some compromises. The fianc\u00e9's response about being roommates seems dismissive of the author's needs. So, maybe the author isn't in the wrong here. But I should check if there's any other angle. The key points are the long-term issue, the health impact, and the fianc\u00e9's inability to adjust. So, probably the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
