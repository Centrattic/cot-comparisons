I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by breaking down the situation. The author is engaged to someone and suggests sleeping in separate rooms because of sleep disturbances. The fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper, watches loud action movies with the TV on, and snores a lot. The author is a light sleeper and can't get a good night's sleep. They've been together for 8 years, engaged for 1, with two kids. The fianc\u00e9 is upset, thinking that if they can't share a bed, why even be a couple.\n\nHmm. The author is trying to address a problem that's causing them significant stress. They've tried to compromise before, like the fianc\u00e9 lowering the volume a bit. But the issue persists. The author is prioritizing their health and well-being by seeking better sleep. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 sees this as a big deal, maybe even a threat to the relationship. \n\nI need to consider if suggesting separate rooms is a reasonable solution. Sleep is important for health, and chronic poor sleep can lead to physical and mental health issues. The author has tried to communicate their needs and the fianc\u00e9 isn't meeting them halfway. The fianc\u00e9's argument about being roommates is a bit extreme; couples can share a home but not a bedroom. However, the author's action might feel like a rejection to the fianc\u00e9. \n\nBut the key here is that the author is not ending the engagement or the relationship. They just want to sleep separately. The fianc\u00e9's reaction seems to be more about feeling rejected than the actual problem. The author has valid reasons and has been dealing with this for years. It's about self-care and maintaining their quality of life. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong. They're addressing a problem that's affecting their well-being. The fianc\u00e9 needs to adjust his habits, but if he's not willing to make changes, then the author has a right to seek a solution that works for them. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the author could have tried more solutions before suggesting separate rooms. Like using earplugs, white noise machines, or talking to a sleep specialist. But the author has already tried some compromises, and the fianc\u00e9 isn't willing to adjust further. So in that case, the author's action is justified. \n\nI think the answer is B (not in the wrong) because the author is taking steps to protect their health and well-being in a long-term relationship where their needs have been ignored. The fianc\u00e9's habits are impacting the author's life significantly, and the author is seeking a practical solution. The fianc\u00e9's perspective is more about the relationship dynamics, but the author's right to rest is a valid concern.\n"
