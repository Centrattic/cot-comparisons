I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for suggesting to their fianc\u00e9 that they sleep in separate rooms. The situation is that the author is a light sleeper and the fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper who snorts a lot and has the TV on loudly. The author is frustrated with the lack of sleep and decided to move to a separate room. The fianc\u00e9 is upset, thinking it undermines their relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's perspective is about their need for rest, which is important for health and well-being. Chronic sleep deprivation can lead to various health issues and affect the relationship negatively. The fianc\u00e9's side is about his sleeping habits, which he might not be able to control fully, like snoring. Also, the fianc\u00e9 argues that sleeping separately makes them just roommates, which is a valid concern in a marriage or engagement.\n\nBut the user already thinks the author is in the wrong. However, I should analyze if that's the case. The author has been dealing with this for 8 years. Maybe they've tried to communicate their needs before without success. The fianc\u00e9's compromise of lowering the volume by 3 points (though the user mentions the volume is still high) might not be sufficient. The author is prioritizing their health, which is understandable. However, suggesting separate rooms might be a drastic step that the fianc\u00e9 perceives as a rejection. \n\nIs there a middle ground? Like using earplugs, white noise machines, or maybe a different sleeping arrangement within the same house but different rooms. The author might have tried these solutions already, but if not, maybe the solution is more about finding a compromise rather than separating completely. But if the fianc\u00e9 is resistant to any changes and the situation is affecting the author's quality of life, then the author's decision is justified.\n\nIn relationships, both partners need to make adjustments. However, if one partner's needs are consistently ignored, they might have a right to take action. The fianc\u00e9's habits are causing harm, and the author is seeking a solution. While separate rooms might feel like a last resort, it's a valid choice if other options have failed. \n\nSo, considering the long-term effects of sleep issues and the author's right to a healthy living environment, the author might not be in the wrong. But the way they presented it as \"going psycho\" might come off as abrupt. Still, the core issue is about health and well-being. The fianc\u00e9's reaction is about the relationship, but if the author isn't getting rest, it could harm the relationship more in the long run. Therefore, the answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
