I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the fianc\u00e9 who suggested sleeping in separate rooms is in the wrong. The situation involves conflicting sleep habits: he needs a quiet, dark room, and she can't sleep with the TV on and loud noises. The fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper who's resistant to adjusting the volume and insists on watching action movies while falling asleep. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to decide.\n\nFirst, the key points are the duration of the problem. They've been together eight years, engaged for a year, and have kids. The fianc\u00e9 has been dealing with the noise for a long time, which suggests he's tried to cope without it getting resolved. The fianc\u00e9's compromise is lowering the volume by three points, but that's still loud. The fianc\u00e9 is now exhausted and decided to move to separate rooms. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9's reasoning is that they need to be able to share a bed as a couple, otherwise it's like roommates. But the author's main issue is their health and well-being. Chronic sleep deprivation can lead to health problems. The fianc\u00e9's right to a good night's sleep is important here. While the fianc\u00e9's request might seem extreme (separate rooms), the underlying issue is unresolved. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9 might have tried to communicate this for years without success. The fianc\u00e9's action is a last resort after enduring years of poor sleep. The fianc\u00e9 is prioritizing their own well-being, which is understandable. The fianc\u00e9 isn't wrong to seek a solution that works for both, but if the fianc\u00e9 has exhausted all options and the other partner is unwilling to accommodate, then the decision to sleep separately is reasonable. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9's partner's argument that sleeping apart would make them just roommates is a bit reductive. Couples can sleep apart for various reasons without it negating the relationship. The main point is mutual respect and accommodation. If one partner's habits are adversely affecting the other's health, it's reasonable to seek a solution. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They've tried to compromise, but the issue isn't resolved. The author's health is a valid concern. The answer would be B (not in the wrong).\n"
