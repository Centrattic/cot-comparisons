I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author suggesting they sleep in separate rooms because their fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper, watches loud TV, and snorts a lot. The author is a light sleeper and has been dealing with this for years, leading to poor sleep.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's main issue is their sleep being disrupted by their partner's habits. Chronic lack of sleep can be really harmful, both physically and mentally. If they've been dealing with this for 8 years and a year of engagement, that's a long time. It's understandable that they'd want to find a solution, even if it means separate rooms.\n\nOn the other side, the fianc\u00e9 seems to have his own habits that aren't easy to change. He's a heavy sleeper, so turning off the TV might not be possible unless he's awake. The fact that he sometimes compromises by lowering the volume a bit shows he does make some effort. But the author is frustrated because it's not enough.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for suggesting separate rooms. The fianc\u00e9's argument is that not sharing a bed might undermine their relationship as a couple. But relationships also require mutual consideration. If the partner's habits are causing significant distress and affecting health, maybe the author is justified in seeking a solution. \n\nHowever, sleeping in separate rooms could be a last resort. Maybe there are other solutions they could explore first, like using white noise machines, earplugs, or adjusting the TV setup. The author might have tried some of these already, but if not, suggesting separate rooms without exhausting other options could be seen as a hasty decision. But given the time frame and the persistence of the issue, it's possible that other solutions have been tried and didn't work.\n\nAlso, the author's well-being is important. If they can't get proper sleep, it affects their entire life. The fianc\u00e9 might not realize the severity of the problem. In that case, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for prioritizing their health. \n\nBut relationships require communication and compromise. The author might have a valid point, but maybe they could have discussed this issue more before deciding to sleep separately. However, the fianc\u00e9's response about being roommates instead of a couple seems dismissive, which isn't helpful. \n\nConsidering all this, I think the author isn't in the wrong. They're trying to address a serious issue that affects their quality of life. While there might be other steps to consider, the decision to sleep apart isn't inherently wrong, especially after a long period of struggling. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
