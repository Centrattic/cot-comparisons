I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a fianc\u00e9 suggesting to sleep in separate rooms due to noise and sleep issues. The author is a light sleeper, and the fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper who also uses the TV loudly at night. The author has had enough and wants separate rooms for better sleep. The fianc\u00e9 is against it, thinking it's the end of the relationship if they can't share a bed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main factors here. The author's need for a quiet environment versus the fianc\u00e9's habits. The author mentions being a light sleeper, which is a valid reason for needing a quiet room. The fianc\u00e9's snoring and the TV volume are significant disturbances. Even though the fianc\u00e9 sometimes lowers the volume, it's not enough. The author has been dealing with this for a long time (8 years together, 1 year engaged, two kids). So this is a chronic issue that's affecting their health and well-being.\n\nThe key point is whether suggesting separate rooms is a reasonable solution. Sleeping apart is a common compromise in some relationships where sleep issues are severe. The author isn't suggesting a breakup but a practical solution to improve their sleep. The fianc\u00e9's reaction seems to be more about the symbolic aspect of sharing a bed rather than the actual problem. The author's main goal is to get rest, which is essential for health, especially with kids involved.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 might feel that the request is a rejection or a sign of something deeper. But the author's explanation is pretty clear about the sleep issue. The fianc\u00e9's counterargument that they can't be a couple otherwise is a bit extreme. They can still be a couple as roommates, as many couples do when they have different needs. The author is trying to find a solution that works for both, even if it's unconventional.\n\nConsidering all this, the author's request seems reasonable. They've tried to compromise (like lowering the volume sometimes) but it's not enough. The health and well-being of the author is at stake here. So, I don't think the author is in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
