I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for suggesting they sleep in separate rooms. The context is that the author is a light sleeper and their fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper who watches loud TV shows while sleeping, causing the author to have poor sleep. They've been dealing with this for a long time, 8 years together and engaged for 1 year with two kids.\n\nFirst, I need to assess both sides. The author's main issue is their inability to sleep well because of the fianc\u00e9's habits. The fianc\u00e9, on the other hand, is used to sleeping with loud TV and might not realize the impact it's having. The author has tried compromising, like the fianc\u00e9 lowering the volume a bit, but it's not enough. The author's frustration is valid because lack of sleep can affect health and relationships.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9's argument is that if they can't share a bed, what's the point of being a couple? This implies that the fianc\u00e9 sees sleeping together as a fundamental part of the relationship. But relationships require mutual adjustments. The author is trying to find a solution for their well-being, which is understandable.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. The key factors are the duration of the problem, attempts to compromise, and the necessity of the solution. The author has been dealing with this for years, tried some compromises, and now the situation is affecting their health. Suggesting separate rooms is a last-resort solution when other methods have failed. The fianc\u00e9's reaction seems to indicate resistance to change, which might not be fair if it's causing harm to the author.\n\nHowever, the author could have explored more alternatives before splitting up. For example, using earplugs, white noise machines, or discussing the issue more thoroughly. But given that the fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper and doesn't respond to volume changes even in sleep, those solutions might not work. \n\nIn terms of relationship dynamics, both partners should make adjustments. The author is trying to prioritize their health, which is crucial. The fianc\u00e9's argument about the point of being a couple might be an overreaction. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They're seeking a solution to a problem that's been ignored or not adequately addressed over time. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
