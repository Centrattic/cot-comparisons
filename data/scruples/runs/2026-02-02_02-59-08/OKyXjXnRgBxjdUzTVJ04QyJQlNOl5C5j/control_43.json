I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) post is in the wrong for suggesting they sleep in separate rooms. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the background: The person is a light sleeper, and their fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper who snores a lot and watches loud TV shows while sleeping. The fianc\u00e9 sometimes lowers the volume a bit but often doesn't. The author has been dealing with this for a long time\u20148 years together, engaged for a year, two kids. They finally had enough and suggested separate rooms. The fianc\u00e9 is upset, saying it's pointless to be a couple if they don't share a bed. The author wants better sleep.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether suggesting separate rooms is a reasonable solution here. Let's consider both sides. The author has a legitimate need for a good night's sleep, which is essential for health and well-being. Chronic sleep deprivation can lead to various health issues, so this isn't trivial. The fianc\u00e9's habits are causing this, and he doesn't seem to be making adequate adjustments. The author has tried compromises, like the fianc\u00e9 lowering the volume slightly, but it's not enough. The fianc\u00e9's argument that they shouldn't be roommates is a bit dismissive of the author's needs and overlooks that couples often have different sleep preferences. Some couples do sleep in separate rooms for health reasons, so it's not unheard of. The fianc\u00e9's reaction might stem from feeling criticized or not understood, but the author's request is about their own well-being. The duration of the relationship and the fact that this has been an ongoing issue for years adds weight to the author's decision. The fianc\u00e9 hasn't shown willingness to adapt, so the author is justified in seeking a solution that works for them. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
