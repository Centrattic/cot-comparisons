I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for suggesting they sleep in separate rooms. The situation is that the person is a light sleeper, and their fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper who snores a lot and watches loud TV before bed. The fianc\u00e9 can't hear the TV if it's too quiet, even in his sleep. They've been together a long time, 8 years, engaged for a year, with two kids. The author is frustrated and wants better sleep, so they suggested separate rooms. The fianc\u00e9 is upset, thinking it's like being roommates.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has a legitimate need for a good night's sleep. Chronic sleep deprivation can affect health and well-being. The fianc\u00e9's habits are causing this problem. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 might feel that the suggestion to sleep separately is a big step and might indicate a problem in their relationship. They might be worried about the commitment or feel that their needs aren't being considered.\n\nBut the core issue here is about incompatible sleeping habits. The author has tried to communicate and compromise, like lowering the TV volume, but it's not working. The fianc\u00e9's behavior is affecting the author's health. In such cases, it's not uncommon for couples to sleep separately, especially if they have different needs. The fact that they have kids and a long relationship might make this a practical solution rather than a relationship issue.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9's reaction seems a bit dramatic. Saying that if they can't share a bed, there's no point in being a couple is a bit extreme. The inability to share a bed doesn't necessarily mean the relationship is failing, especially if there are other ways to maintain intimacy besides co-sleeping. The author's main concern is health, which is valid. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong here. They're addressing a real issue that affects their well-being. The fianc\u00e9's resistance might stem from not understanding the severity of the sleep problem or feeling that the solution is too drastic. But the author's request is reasonable given the circumstances. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
