I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for suggesting to sleep in separate rooms. The situation involves the author being a light sleeper and their fianc\u00e9 being a heavy sleeper with snoring and needing the TV on.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the arguments from both sides. The author has valid reasons: poor sleep quality due to noise from the TV and the fianc\u00e9's snoring. They've been dealing with this for a long time, which is affecting their well-being. The fianc\u00e9 argues that sleeping separately would make them just roommates, which is a common counterargument in relationships.\n\nThe key points here are the impact of the fianc\u00e9's habits on the author's health and the relationship dynamics. Chronic lack of sleep can lead to serious health issues, so the author is trying to address a real problem. The fianc\u00e9's response seems to minimize the issue, focusing on the relationship's intimacy rather than the health aspect.\n\nHowever, suggesting separate rooms might be seen as a last resort. Maybe there were prior attempts to find a compromise? The author mentions that sometimes the fianc\u00e9 lowers the volume by 3 points, but it's still noisy. The fianc\u00e9's reliance on the TV for sleep is unusual and might indicate a need for a different solution, like earplugs or a white noise machine. \n\nBut the author's decision might be seen as reasonable given the circumstances. The fianc\u00e9's reaction could be missing the point. The author isn't looking for a romantic fix but a practical one. Long-term relationships often require such compromises. Since the author has been suffering for a long time, it's understandable they want a change. \n\nIn terms of fault, it's about whether the author overstepped. Since the problem has been ongoing and the author is prioritizing their health, they're probably not in the wrong. The fianc\u00e9's argument about roommates is a common deflection. So the answer would likely be B (not in the wrong).\n"
