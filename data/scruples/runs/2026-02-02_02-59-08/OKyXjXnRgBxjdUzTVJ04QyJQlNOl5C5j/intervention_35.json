I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for suggesting they sleep in separate rooms. The situation involves the writer being a light sleeper and their fianc\u00e9 being a heavy sleeper who needs the TV on at a high volume. They've been dealing with this for a long time, and the fianc\u00e9 is upset about the suggestion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The writer's main issue is their sleep being disturbed by the noise. Chronic lack of good sleep can affect health and well-being, so that's a valid concern. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 is used to his sleep habits, which might be due to something like snoring or needing background noise. He might feel that the request is breaking a fundamental part of their relationship, hence the reaction about being roommates instead of a couple.\n\nNow, the user initially thought the author is in the wrong. But I should analyze again. Is the author's right to prioritize their health and comfort valid? The fianc\u00e9's habits are causing significant distress. The author has tried compromising (like the fianc\u00e9 lowering the volume slightly), but it's not enough. The key point is whether the author's solution (separate rooms) is reasonable. Some people do sleep better in separate rooms, and if they can maintain the relationship that way, maybe it's justified. However, the fianc\u00e9's reaction suggests he might not be open to that solution, which could lead to bigger issues. \n\nBut the question is about who is in the wrong. The author's actions are self-preservation after years of struggle. The fianc\u00e9's habits are the root cause. So the author isn't the one at fault here. They're seeking a solution to a problem caused by the other person's behavior. The fianc\u00e9 might need to adjust more or seek help for his snoring, or maybe they need to find another compromise. But the author isn't wrong for wanting to take care of their own needs. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
