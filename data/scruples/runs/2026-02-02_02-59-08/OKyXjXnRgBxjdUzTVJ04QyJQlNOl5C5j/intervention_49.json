I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for suggesting sleeping in separate rooms. The situation is about differing sleep habits. The fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper with loud snoring and insists on having the TV on at a high volume, which disrupts the author's sleep. The author is a light sleeper and has been struggling with this for a long time, leading them to propose separate rooms.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is clearly frustrated after years of poor sleep. The fianc\u00e9's habits are causing significant distress. The author's primary need is rest, which is essential for health and well-being. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 feels that sleeping separately undermines their relationship, comparing it to just being roommates. \n\nBut is the author in the wrong? Well, communication is key in relationships. The author has tried to compromise, like lowering the TV volume, but it's not enough. The fianc\u00e9's response is to question the relationship's validity if they can't share a bed. That seems dismissive of the author's needs. The author's decision to prioritize their health by sleeping separately might be a necessary step when all else fails. \n\nHowever, maybe there are other solutions they haven't explored yet, like earplugs, white noise machines, or adjusting the TV habits further. But the author has already tried some compromises and the fianc\u00e9 isn't willing to change. In that case, the author isn't being unreasonable. They have a legitimate need for rest, which is being neglected. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They're addressing a long-standing issue that affects their well-being. The fianc\u00e9's reaction seems more about the relationship's structure rather than addressing the author's needs. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
