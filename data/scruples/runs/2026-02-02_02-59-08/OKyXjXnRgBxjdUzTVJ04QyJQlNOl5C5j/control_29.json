I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're at fault for wanting to sleep in separate rooms because their fianc\u00e9's sleep habits are disrupting their rest. They mention being a light sleeper and their partner being a heavy sleeper who uses the TV loudly. They tried compromising but it's not working, so they suggested separate rooms.\n\nFirst, considering their health and well-being. Sleep is important for everyone, and chronic lack of good sleep can lead to health issues. The fianc\u00e9's actions are causing significant distress, and the person is seeking a solution to improve their sleep quality. That seems reasonable.\n\nSecond, the duration of the issue. They've been together 8 years and engaged for 1, with two kids. The problem has persisted for a long time, and they've tried some compromises, but it's not enough. It's not like they're just being overly sensitive; this is a long-standing problem.\n\nThird, the fianc\u00e9's response. He's arguing that separate rooms mean they're just roommates. That's a common argument, but it's more about his perspective rather than the actual issue. The person's need for rest is valid. They're not trying to avoid the relationship but to maintain their health and possibly the relationship in the long run if they can function better.\n\nPossible counterarguments: Maybe there are other solutions they haven't tried. But they mentioned some compromises already. Also, the fianc\u00e9's TV habit in bed might be a personal preference, but it's affecting someone else. The partner's refusal to adjust despite the impact suggests the problem is on his side.\n\nIn relationships, both partners should make sacrifices. If one's needs are causing harm to the other's well-being, it's reasonable to seek a solution. The author isn't being unreasonable; they're prioritizing their health. So, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
