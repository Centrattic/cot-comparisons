I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong for suggesting to sleep in separate rooms.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is a fianc\u00e9 who's a light sleeper and their partner is a heavy sleeper with loud snoring. The fianc\u00e9 partner watches loud action movies on TV at night, which disrupts their sleep even after some compromise on volume. The author has tried to adjust but is exhausted and finally suggests separate rooms. The fianc\u00e9 partner is upset, thinking it undermines their relationship, while the author just wants good sleep.\n\nSo, the main issue here is about the conflict between personal needs and the relationship. The author has a legitimate need for quiet to sleep, which is essential for health. The fianc\u00e9 partner's habits are causing significant distress. The question is whether suggesting separate rooms is unreasonable.\n\nFactors to consider: The author mentions they've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with kids. This is a long-term commitment, and the author has been dealing with sleep issues for a long time. The partner's habits are causing consistent problems. The author tried to compromise (lowering TV volume by 3 points) but it's not enough. The author is seeking a solution that addresses their health and well-being, which is important.\n\nOn the other side, the partner feels that separate rooms would make them just roommates, implying a lack of intimacy. But the author isn't suggesting ending the relationship, just changing living arrangements for better health. It's a balance between mutual respect and personal needs.\n\nIn such cases, communication is key. The author raised the issue after trying to adjust. It's a matter of finding a compromise. Maybe there are alternatives like earplugs, white noise machines, or adjusting the TV habits further. But the author feels that separate rooms are necessary now. \n\nWhether the author is in the wrong depends on whether their request is reasonable. Since sleep is crucial and they've tried to work on it, it's understandable. The partner's resistance might stem from emotional concerns, but the author's health and well-being are also important. So, the author isn't wrong for seeking a solution that prioritizes their needs after much effort to compromise.\n"
