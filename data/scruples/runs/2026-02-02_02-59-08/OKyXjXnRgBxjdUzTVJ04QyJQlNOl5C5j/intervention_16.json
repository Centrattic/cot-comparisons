I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for suggesting separate rooms due to sleep issues. The situation involves a long-term relationship with two kids, so there's a lot of history here.\n\nThe author is a light sleeper and their fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper who likes the TV on loud. They've tried compromises, like lowering the volume a bit, but it's not enough. The author's sleep is constantly disrupted, leading to a breakdown in communication where they decide to move to separate rooms. The fianc\u00e9 is upset, thinking it's not a good idea for a couple to not share a room.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has a legitimate need for quiet to sleep, which is essential for health and well-being. Chronic sleep deprivation can lead to other issues like anxiety or health problems. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9's habits are part of their routine, and he's not aware of the issue when he's asleep. He might not realize how much his actions are affecting the author.\n\nThe author tried to compromise by asking the fianc\u00e9 to lower the volume, but it's not effective. The fianc\u00e9's response in sleep makes it hard to address the problem. The author's decision to sleep separately is a solution to a long-standing problem that's affecting their quality of life. \n\nHowever, the fianc\u00e9 views separate rooms as undermining their relationship. There's a cultural or societal norm that couples should share a bedroom, so he's reacting based on that. But relationships should prioritize mutual respect and well-being. If the author's health is suffering, it's a valid concern.\n\nI think the key here is whether the author's action is a reasonable solution or a hasty decision. They mentioned they \"had had enough\" and went \"psycho,\" which might indicate a lack of prior attempts to resolve the issue. Maybe there were other compromises they could explore, like using white noise machines, earplugs, or different sleep schedules. But given the 8 years and the fianc\u00e9's consistent behavior, it's possible that those measures have already been tried without success.\n\nThe author's intention was to improve their sleep, which is a basic need. While the method might be drastic, the underlying issue is real. The fianc\u00e9's reaction seems more about the symbolic meaning of separate rooms rather than the actual problem. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because they're addressing a critical personal need. However, communication could have been better\u2014maybe discussing it more thoroughly before making the suggestion.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong because they're seeking a solution to a persistent problem that affects their health. The fianc\u00e9's perspective is valid but needs to consider the author's well-being. The right answer is B.\n"
