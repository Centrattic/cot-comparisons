I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that they're engaged, have been together for 8 years, with 2 kids. The author is a light sleeper and the fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper who snores a lot and watches TV loud at night. The author can't take it anymore and suggested sleeping in separate rooms. The fianc\u00e9 is upset, thinking it's a bad idea and questioning the point of being a couple if they don't share a bed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's main issue is their sleep being disrupted. Chronic poor sleep can lead to health issues, so it's a valid concern. The fianc\u00e9's habits are causing this, and the author has tried to compromise (like lowering the TV volume a bit), but it's not enough. The author's solution is to sleep separately, which might seem extreme but is a practical way to get rest.\n\nOn the other side, the fianc\u00e9 might feel that the author is giving up on a shared life aspect. The fianc\u00e9's behavior (TV at half volume, loud snoring) is the problem here. The author is trying to address their own needs, which are essential for well-being. The fianc\u00e9's reaction seems to be about the symbolism of sharing a bed rather than the actual problem. The author isn't ending the relationship; they just want better sleep. \n\nI think the key here is that the author is trying to solve a real problem that affects their health and relationship satisfaction. The fianc\u00e9's habits are the root cause. The author isn't being selfish; they're seeking a practical solution. So, the author isn't in the wrong. They should perhaps communicate better and explore other solutions first, but suggesting separate rooms isn't wrong when all else fails. Answer B.\n"
