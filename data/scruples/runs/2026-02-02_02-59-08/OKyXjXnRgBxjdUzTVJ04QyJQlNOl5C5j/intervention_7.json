I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for suggesting they sleep in separate rooms. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe author is engaged, has two kids, and has been with their fianc\u00e9 for 8 years, engaged for 1. They mention being a light sleeper, while the fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper and snores loudly. He also sleeps with the TV on at a high volume, watching action movies with lots of noise. The author can't sleep well because of this, and even when they ask him to turn it down, he doesn't notice it's too loud. Now, they've decided to sleep in separate rooms, and the fianc\u00e9 is upset, thinking that if they can't share a bed, what's the point of being a couple. The author is asking if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is seeking a solution to their sleep issues, which are clearly affecting their quality of life. Chronic poor sleep can lead to health issues, so it's a valid concern. The fianc\u00e9's habits are contributing to this problem\u2014snoring and sleeping with the TV on. The author tried to compromise by lowering the volume, but it's not enough. The fianc\u00e9's response is emotional, suggesting that separate rooms would make them just roommates, not a couple. But the author's main issue is their own well-being. \n\nNow, whether the author is in the wrong. It's a matter of balancing personal needs with the relationship. The author is prioritizing their health and well-being, which is important. However, suggesting separate rooms is a significant step. The fianc\u00e9 might feel rejected or that the author isn't trying to find a solution together. But given the long-term issue and the lack of resolution, the author might feel this is the only way. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at whether the person acted reasonably. The author tried to compromise but to no avail. They are asking for a solution that affects their health. The fianc\u00e9's response seems more about the relationship's symbolism rather than addressing the problem. The author isn't being selfish; they are seeking a better quality of life. The fianc\u00e9's habits are problematic, and the author is taking responsibility by suggesting a change. \n\nSo, the answer would likely be B (Not in the wrong) because the author is acting in their own well-being after trying to resolve the issue. The fianc\u00e9's reaction is more about the relationship's structure, but the author's health is a valid reason to seek a separate room. They are not wrong for prioritizing their needs in a long-term relationship where the issues haven't been resolved despite efforts.\n"
