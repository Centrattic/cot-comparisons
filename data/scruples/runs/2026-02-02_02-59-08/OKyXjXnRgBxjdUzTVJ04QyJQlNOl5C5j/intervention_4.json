I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nThe author is a fianc\u00e9 who wants to sleep in a separate room from their partner. The reasons given are that the partner is a heavy sleeper, snores loudly, and watches loud action movies on TV at night. The author is a light sleeper and can't sleep with all that noise. They tried compromising, like the partner lowering the volume a bit, but it's still not enough. The author finally suggested sleeping in separate rooms, and the partner is upset about it, saying that if they can't share a bed, what's the point of being a couple instead of roommates. The author has been dealing with this for 8 years and has two kids now.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no, not in the wrong). \n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has a legitimate need for a good night's sleep, which is important for health and well-being. Chronic sleep disruption can lead to various health issues. The partner's habits are causing this disruption, and the author has tried compromising (like the partner lowering the volume slightly). However, the partner's response seems to be that the author is being unreasonable by suggesting separate rooms. The partner's argument is that sharing a bed is a fundamental part of being a couple, so if they can't do that, they might as well be roommates.\n\nOn the other hand, the author isn't suggesting breaking up or separating the family, just sleeping in separate rooms. The partner's TV habits are causing the issue, and the author's solution is to remove themselves from the noise. It's possible that the partner could also make changes, like wearing earplugs, using a white noise machine, or finding a quieter movie to watch. But the author isn't asking the partner to change; they're just moving to another room to get some peace. \n\nAnother angle: in a long-term relationship, both partners should make sacrifices for each other's well-being. However, if one person's habits are consistently harming the other's health, it's reasonable to seek a solution. The author's choice might be a last resort after years of poor sleep. The partner's reaction might stem from feeling that the author is rejecting the relationship, but the author's intention is just to get rest, not to end the relationship. \n\nI think the key here is whether the author is being unreasonable. The partner is making a big deal about sleeping in separate rooms, but the author's need for sleep is valid. The solution of separate rooms is a way to address the problem without breaking up. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong. They're trying to find a way to coexist comfortably. The partner needs to be more understanding and maybe take responsibility for their own habits that are affecting the author's sleep. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the author could have tried more compromises before suggesting separate rooms. But the author did mention that the partner's volume was only lowered by 3 points, which might not be enough. If the author has exhausted all other options, then separate rooms could be a reasonable step. \n\nIn conclusion, I think the author is not in the wrong because they're addressing a legitimate issue that affects their health, and the solution is a practical one that doesn't end the relationship. The partner should be more considerate and perhaps take steps to reduce noise in the shared space. So the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
