I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for suggesting they sleep in separate rooms. The situation is that the author is a light sleeper and their fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper who watches loud TV late at night, causing sleep issues. The fianc\u00e9 argues that if they can't share a bed, the relationship isn't worth it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author has been dealing with this for 8 years and has kids. They\u2019ve tried some compromises, like lowering the volume a bit, but it's not enough. The key points are the author's right to a good night's sleep versus the fianc\u00e9's habits. \n\nSleep is a big deal for health and well-being. Chronic sleep deprivation can lead to serious issues. The fianc\u00e9's behavior is affecting the author's health, which is a significant factor. However, moving to separate rooms is a major step. Maybe there are other solutions first, like using earplugs, a white noise machine, or maybe the fianc\u00e9 could move the TV to another room. \n\nBut the author mentions they tried some compromises, and the fianc\u00e9 doesn't seem to prioritize the author's needs. The fianc\u00e9's argument about being roommates instead of a couple seems dismissive. The author's main goal is to get rest, which is valid. \n\nOn the flip side, maybe the author could have explored other solutions before suggesting separate rooms. However, given the time they've been together and the lack of resolution, the author's frustration is understandable. \n\nSo, am I in the wrong? If the author has genuinely tried to communicate and find middle ground and it's still not working, their decision is reasonable. The fianc\u00e9's response seems to undervalue the author's well-being. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
