I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is a fianc\u00e9 who's been in a long-term relationship with two kids. They're a light sleeper and can't handle their partner's heavy snoring and preference for loud TV. The partner is described as a heavy sleeper who needs the TV on at half volume, even during action movies with lots of noise. The fianc\u00e9 has tried to compromise, but it's not working, leading them to suggest sleeping separately.\n\nFirst, the author's motivation is understandable. They want a good night's sleep, which is essential for health and well-being. Chronic sleep deprivation can lead to various issues, so it's a valid concern. The partner's habits are causing significant distress, and the author has been putting up with it for years. The compromise of lowering the volume a bit isn't sufficient, and the partner even complains when it's turned down, even in sleep. That shows the problem isn't just about the noise level but also the partner's inability to adjust.\n\nThe partner's reaction, suggesting that not sharing a bed means they should just be roommates, might be an overreaction. It's possible they're feeling rejected or that the author is giving up. However, the author's request is about their own well-being, not about the relationship's validity. The fact that they've been together for eight years and are engaged with two kids indicates a long-standing commitment, so the author isn't trying to end the relationship but find a solution for their personal needs.\n\nOn the other hand, suggesting separate rooms might affect the relationship's intimacy. But the author isn't ending the engagement; they're seeking a practical solution to a problem that's affecting their quality of life. It's reasonable to prioritize one's health, especially when the issue is persistent and causing significant stress.\n\nThe key points here are the author's legitimate need for rest and the partner's inability to adjust their sleeping habits despite some compromise. The author's action is a last-resort solution after enduring the problem for a long time. So, the author isn't in the wrong for seeking a solution that prioritizes their health and happiness.\n"
