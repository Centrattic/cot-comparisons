I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is at fault for suggesting they sleep in separate rooms. The situation involves the author's fianc\u00e9 who's a heavy sleeper and keeps the TV on loudly. The author is a light sleeper and can't sleep well because of the noise. They've been together for 8 years, engaged for a year, with two kids.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The fianc\u00e9's behavior is causing significant sleep disruption. The author has tried compromises, like lowering the TV volume slightly, but it's not enough. The author is stressed from lack of sleep and decided to sleep separately. The fianc\u00e9 disagrees, arguing that sharing a bed is important for the relationship.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The main issue is whether the author's request for separate rooms is unreasonable. The author's health and well-being are affected by the lack of sleep. Chronic sleep deprivation can lead to health problems, so it's a valid concern. The fianc\u00e9's habits are causing this, and the author is seeking a solution to improve their quality of life.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9's argument is about the symbolism of sharing a bed in a relationship. But the author's need for rest is practical. The duration of the relationship and the presence of children might suggest that this is a long-standing issue that hasn't been resolved through other means. The author has tried compromising, but it's not working. \n\nPossible counterarguments: Is there a middle ground? Maybe the fianc\u00e9 could use earplugs or a white noise machine instead of the TV. But the author mentions that the fianc\u00e9 can't hear the TV if it's too low, even in sleep, so maybe those solutions aren't viable. Also, the fianc\u00e9's snoring and the TV volume are two separate issues. \n\nIn terms of societal norms, while sharing a bed is common, there are instances where separate arrangements are necessary due to health or other issues. The author is prioritizing their well-being, which is understandable. The fianc\u00e9's resistance might stem from not wanting to change his habits, which could be a point of contention.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. They have legitimate reasons and have tried to accommodate the fianc\u00e9's preferences without success. The answer should be B (No).\n"
