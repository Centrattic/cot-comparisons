I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is at fault for suggesting they sleep in separate rooms. The situation involves sleep issues due to different preferences and habits.\n\nFirst, the author is a light sleeper needing a quiet environment. The fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper, snores loudly, and watches TV at a high volume. Despite some compromise, the TV volume is still too loud, leading to the author's sleep being disrupted. After years of this, the author suggests separate rooms, and the fianc\u00e9 is against it, questioning their relationship.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points are the author's right to a good night's sleep versus the fianc\u00e9's habits. Sleep deprivation can have serious health effects, so the author's concern is valid. The fianc\u00e9's habits are causing this issue, not the author. The author is seeking a solution after enduring the problem for 8 years, which shows they've tried to compromise. The fianc\u00e9's reaction seems dismissive and not considering the author's needs. \n\nIn relationships, both partners should make efforts to accommodate each other's needs. However, when one's health and well-being are at stake, it's reasonable to seek a solution. The author isn't being unreasonable; they're addressing a long-standing problem. The fianc\u00e9's resistance seems to stem from a misunderstanding of the necessity of the solution. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. They're trying to improve their quality of life within the relationship. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
