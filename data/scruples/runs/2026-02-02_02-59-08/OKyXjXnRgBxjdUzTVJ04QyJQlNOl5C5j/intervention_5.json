I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a fianc\u00e9 suggesting they sleep in separate rooms because of differing sleep habits. The author is a light sleeper, and the partner is a heavy sleeper with loud snoring and TV on at night. The author had enough and suggested separate rooms, while the fianc\u00e9 is upset about it. The user initially thought the author is in the wrong but wants others' opinions.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The author's main issue is their sleep being disrupted by their partner's habits. They've been dealing with this for years, which is affecting their well-being. The fianc\u00e9 argues that sleeping separately would make them just roommates, not a couple. But the author's health and rest are important. \n\nSleep quality is crucial for overall health. Chronic sleep disruption can lead to various health issues. The partner's habits are not just occasional; they're consistent every night. The author has tried compromising, like the partner lowering the volume a bit, but it's still not enough. The author's suggestion might be seen as extreme, but considering the long-term effects on their health, it's a valid concern. \n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 feels that separate rooms would change the dynamic of their relationship. But the author is looking for a solution to their problem, which is reasonable. The fianc\u00e9's reaction might be more about emotional attachment to sharing a room rather than addressing the actual problem. \n\nThe key points here are the health impact of the sleep issues and the length of time this has been happening. The author isn't just being selfish; they're seeking a way to maintain their well-being. While relationships often require compromise, there's a limit when one partner's habits are causing significant harm. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author is not in the wrong. They're trying to address a legitimate problem affecting their health. The fianc\u00e9's perspective is valid but doesn't override the author's need for rest. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
