I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for suggesting they sleep in separate rooms. The situation is that the author is a light sleeper, and their fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper who watches loud TV shows and snores a lot. The fianc\u00e9 can't hear the TV if it's too quiet, even in his sleep. The author has been dealing with this for years and finally suggested separate rooms. The fianc\u00e9 is upset, thinking that if they can't share a bed, why be a couple. \n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the arguments from both sides. The author's main issue is lack of sleep due to noise. Chronic sleep deprivation can have serious health effects, so this is a valid concern. The fianc\u00e9's habits are causing this problem, and the author has tried to compromise by having him lower the volume slightly. However, the problem persists, leading to the author's decision to sleep separately.\n\nOn the other side, the fianc\u00e9 feels that sleeping separately undermines their relationship, viewing it as a step towards being just roommates. But the author's motivation is to get rest, not to distance themselves. The fact that they've been together for 8 years and engaged for 1, with two kids, shows a long-term commitment. The author is trying to solve a practical problem that's affecting their well-being.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? The fianc\u00e9's needs are important, but so are the author's. The author isn't suggesting ending the relationship, just adjusting their sleeping arrangements for health reasons. The fianc\u00e9's reaction seems more about feeling rejected than about the actual issue. The author isn't being selfish; they're addressing a long-standing problem that's affecting their quality of life. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
