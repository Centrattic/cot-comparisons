I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's take a look at this situation. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for suggesting sleeping in separate rooms. They mentioned being a light sleeper and their fianc\u00e9 being a heavy sleeper with loud snoring and TV habits. The fianc\u00e9 turns on loud movies and can't hear if the volume is turned down, even while asleep.\n\nHmm, so the author wants peace to sleep. They've been dealing with this for years, which adds to the stress. They have two kids, so maybe they're both already sleep-deprived. The fianc\u00e9's behavior is causing consistent disruption. \n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 might feel that the author is overreacting or that they're supposed to tolerate some level of noise in a relationship. But the author has tried to compromise by lowering the volume slightly, but it's not enough. The problem seems intractable\u2014noise every night leading to poor sleep. \n\nSleep is a basic need. Chronic lack of sleep can affect health and relationships. The author's request for a separate room is to address a legitimate issue. The fianc\u00e9's argument that they should just be roommates if they can't share a bed is a bit extreme. Roommates might have separate rooms too, so that analogy doesn't hold. \n\nConsidering they're engaged and have children, the strain on the relationship is real. The author's action is a solution to a long-standing problem. The fianc\u00e9's habits are causing harm, and the author is taking a step to protect their well-being. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Probably not. They're addressing their needs after years of struggle. The fianc\u00e9's reaction might be valid if there were other solutions tried, but given the persistent issue, separate rooms might be necessary. Answer B (not in the wrong) makes sense here.\n"
