I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a fianc\u00e9 suggesting they sleep in separate rooms because the other partner's sleep habits are really disruptive. The author is a light sleeper, and the fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper who sleeps with the TV on loud. The fianc\u00e9 also snores a lot, which adds to the noise. The author has been dealing with this for 8 years and is now suggesting separate rooms to get some rest.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author's main issue is lack of sleep due to the fianc\u00e9's habits. Chronic sleep deprivation can have serious health effects, so that's a valid concern. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 might feel rejected or like the relationship is in trouble if they're asked to sleep separately. The fianc\u00e9's response about being roommates instead of a couple suggests he sees sleeping together as a fundamental part of a romantic relationship.\n\nIs there a middle ground? Have they tried other solutions? The author mentions the fianc\u00e9 sometimes lowers the volume a bit, but not enough. Maybe they could try earplugs or white noise machines? Or maybe the fianc\u00e9 could wear headphones for the TV? Also, could they agree on a specific time when the TV is turned off each night? It's possible that the author didn't explore these alternatives before suggesting separate rooms, which might make their approach seem hasty.\n\nHowever, 8 years of this is a long time. If all other solutions have been tried and failed, then separate rooms might be the only remaining option. The author's health and well-being are important. The fianc\u00e9's reaction might be emotional, but the author's need for rest is also significant. In relationships, compromise is key, and if the fianc\u00e9 is unwilling to adapt further, then the author's decision could be justified.\n\nSo, considering all that, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. They're prioritizing their health and trying to find a solution to a long-standing problem. The fianc\u00e9's reaction seems to stem from feeling rejected rather than understanding the necessity. Therefore, the answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
