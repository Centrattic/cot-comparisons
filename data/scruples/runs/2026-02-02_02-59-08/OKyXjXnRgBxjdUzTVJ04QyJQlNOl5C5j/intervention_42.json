I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe author is a fianc\u00e9 who's a light sleeper and wants a quiet room at night. Their partner is a heavy sleeper who snors a lot and insists on having the TV on at a loud volume. The author says this has been going on for a long time\u2014eight years together, engaged for a year, with two kids. The partner doesn't seem to make much effort to adjust, only lowering the volume slightly when asked. The author finally snaps and suggests sleeping in separate rooms. The partner responds by saying if they can't share a bed, maybe they should just be roommates. The author is asking if they're in the wrong for proposing separate rooms.\n\nFirst, I should consider both sides. The author is dealing with chronic sleep disturbance, which can have health impacts. Long-term poor sleep can lead to stress, irritability, and other issues. The author's request isn't unreasonable\u2014they want to sleep in a quiet environment. On the other hand, the partner's needs are also valid. The partner is a heavy sleeper and prefers background noise from the TV. The author tried to compromise by adjusting the volume a bit, but clearly, it's not enough.\n\nThe partner's reaction is defensive, implying that separate rooms would undermine their relationship. That could be a bit of an overreaction, but relationships do involve compromise. The author's partner might not realize how bad the situation is, or maybe they feel that their needs are more important. The author has been putting up with this for a long time, which suggests they've tried to make the situation work but are now at their limit.\n\nIs suggesting separate rooms a reasonable step? In some cases, couples do choose separate bedrooms for various reasons, especially if it's affecting their health or well-being. The author's main issue is their own sleep, which is crucial. If the partner is unwilling to adjust their habits significantly, then separate rooms could be a practical solution. However, the partner's response is dismissive, not addressing the author's valid concerns about sleep. \n\nI think the author is in the right because their health and well-being are important. The partner isn't making a good faith effort to accommodate the author's needs. The author's request is a reasonable way to resolve a long-standing issue. However, some might argue that moving to separate rooms is a drastic step and that there are other solutions, like different sleeping arrangements or devices to block noise. But given the length of the problem and the lack of progress, maybe it's justified.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They're trying to prioritize their health and have a good marriage, but the partner isn't cooperating. Therefore, the answer is B (Not in the wrong).\n"
