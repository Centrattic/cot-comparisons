I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who posted this situation is in the wrong for suggesting to sleep in separate rooms.\n\nFirst, the background: The person is a light sleeper needing a quiet environment. Their fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper, snores loudly, and watches TV at a high volume. Even when he lowers the volume a bit, the noise from action movies with loud sounds is disruptive. The situation has been going on for 8 years, with 1 year engaged and two kids. The user has been struggling with sleep for a long time and finally suggested separate rooms.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9's reaction is that they might as well be roommates if they don't share a bed. But the user's main issue is their health and well-being, needing rest. They're not trying to end the relationship but to find a solution that works for both. The user's request seems reasonable given the circumstances. The fianc\u00e9 isn't compromising effectively. Turning down the TV volume by a few points isn't enough, and the snoring is a separate issue. The user is seeking a solution that's been ignored for years. So, the user isn't in the wrong; they're trying to address a long-standing problem that affects their quality of life. The answer should be B.\n"
