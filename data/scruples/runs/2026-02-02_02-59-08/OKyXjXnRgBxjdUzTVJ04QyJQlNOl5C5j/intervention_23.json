I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for suggesting they sleep in separate rooms. The situation involves the author being a light sleeper and their fianc\u00e9 being a heavy sleeper who uses the TV loudly at night. The key points here are their 8-year relationship, having two kids, and the fianc\u00e9's resistance to the idea.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author wants a good night's sleep, which is a basic need. Chronic sleep deprivation can have serious health effects. The fianc\u00e9's habits (TV volume and snoring) are causing the problem. The author has tried compromises like lowering the volume a bit, but it's not enough. The fianc\u00e9's reaction is to question the purpose of the relationship if they can't share a bedroom, which seems dismissive of the author's well-being.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 might feel that the author is giving up too easily. They might prefer finding other solutions first, like earplugs, white noise machines, or adjusting the TV setup. Also, moving to separate rooms could affect family dynamics, especially with the kids. But the author has been dealing with this for a long time, so maybe all other options have been exhausted.\n\nThe author's request seems reasonable given the circumstances. It's about maintaining their health and quality of life. The fianc\u00e9's response is more about the symbolism of sharing a bedroom rather than addressing the author's needs. In relationships, both partners' well-being is important. So, maybe the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to prioritize their health. However, the approach of just declaring it without trying other solutions might be an issue. But the post mentions they've tried some compromises already.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They're seeking a solution to a long-standing problem that's affecting their health. The fianc\u00e9's reaction seems to prioritize the romantic aspect over the practical needs, which could be a red flag. Therefore, the answer might be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
