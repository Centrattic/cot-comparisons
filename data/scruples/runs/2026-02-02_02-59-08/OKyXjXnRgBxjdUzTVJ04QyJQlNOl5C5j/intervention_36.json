I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for suggesting separate rooms. The situation is that the fianc\u00e9 is a light sleeper and the other partner is a heavy sleeper with loud snoring and TV on. The fianc\u00e9 can't sleep well and after years of this, suggests separate rooms. The fianc\u00e9's partner is upset and thinks it's bad. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants opinions.\n\nHmm. First, I need to consider both sides. The author has a valid problem: they can't sleep because their partner's habits are disruptive. They've been dealing with this for 8 years and have kids. Chronic sleep issues can affect health, so it's a real concern. The fianc\u00e9's partner is being accommodating by adjusting the TV volume a bit, but not enough. The author is trying to find a solution to get rest, which is important for their well-being.\n\nOn the other side, the partner feels that separate rooms would be like being roommates, which might seem like giving up on the relationship. But the author is in a committed engagement with children, so it's not like they're not in a serious relationship. The partner's sleeping habits are extreme\u2014snoring like a train and needing loud TV. Maybe there's an underlying issue like sleep apnea that hasn't been addressed. The author is seeking a solution after years of suffering, which could be seen as reasonable.\n\nBut is there a middle ground? Could they try other solutions first, like earplugs, a white noise machine, or consulting a doctor for the snoring and sleep issues? The author might have considered those but maybe they didn't work. If they've already tried some compromises and it's still not working, separate rooms might be a necessary step for their health.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9's argument that separate rooms undermine the relationship is a bit simplistic. Relationships require compromise, but when one person's health is at stake, it's a valid concern. The author is not suggesting never seeing each other but just sleeping separately to get rest. It's a practical solution rather than a romantic one.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They're prioritizing their health and well-being after years of poor sleep, which is important. The answer should be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
