I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for suggesting to sleep in separate rooms. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author is a light sleeper who needs a quiet environment. Their fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper who snores loudly and insists on having the TV on at a high volume. The fianc\u00e9 watches action movies with lots of noise, and when the author tries to lower the volume, he wakes up and complains in his sleep. This has been going on for a long time\u20148 years together, engaged for 1, with two kids. The author is exhausted and finally suggests separate rooms.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9 argues that if they can't share a bed, what's the point of being a couple instead of roommates. The key here is whether the author's needs are reasonable. The author's health and well-being are at stake because of chronic sleep issues. The fianc\u00e9's habits are causing significant distress. \n\nI need to consider if there have been attempts to resolve this. The author mentions that the fianc\u00e9 sometimes lowers the volume a little, but it's not enough. Have they tried other solutions? Maybe a white noise machine, earplugs, or a different TV setup? But even if they did, if those solutions aren't working, separate rooms might be necessary. \n\nIn relationships, both partners should accommodate each other's needs, but there's a limit. Chronic sleep deprivation can lead to health issues. The author's request for a separate room is a last resort after years of problems. The fianc\u00e9's argument about being roommates doesn't address the author's legitimate need for rest. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They're prioritizing their health. The fianc\u00e9's habits are impacting the author's well-being, and suggesting separate rooms is a reasonable solution. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
