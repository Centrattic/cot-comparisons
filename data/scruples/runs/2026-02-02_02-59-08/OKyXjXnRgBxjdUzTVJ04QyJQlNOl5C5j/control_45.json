I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for suggesting to their fianc\u00e9 that they sleep in separate rooms. The main issue here is their differing sleeping habits. The fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper who snores loudly and watches TV loudly at night, which the author can't handle because they're a light sleeper. They've been dealing with this for a long time, 8 years together and 1 year engaged with two kids. The fianc\u00e9 is upset and thinks sleeping separately would make them just roommates.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let me break this down. The author is seeking a solution to a long-standing problem that's affecting their health and well-being. Sleep is crucial, and chronic lack of good sleep can lead to various health issues. The fianc\u00e9's habits are causing this problem, and the author has tried compromising (like lowering the TV volume a bit) but it's not enough. The fianc\u00e9's argument is about the relationship's nature, but the author's need for sleep is valid.\n\nIn relationships, compromise is key, but both parties need to respect each other's needs. If the fianc\u00e9 is unwilling to find a middle ground that allows both to sleep well, then the author is justified in seeking an alternative. Suggesting separate rooms isn't about ending the relationship but about improving their quality of life. The fact that they've been dealing with this for so long without resolution might mean the author is right to take this step.\n\nHowever, some might argue that sleeping separately could affect the intimacy of the relationship. But the author's argument is that their health and sleep are suffering, which is a basic need. If the fianc\u00e9 can't adjust, then separate rooms might be necessary. So, the author isn't in the wrong here because they're trying to address a legitimate issue that's been ongoing. The fianc\u00e9's resistance might be part of the problem, not the solution. Therefore, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
