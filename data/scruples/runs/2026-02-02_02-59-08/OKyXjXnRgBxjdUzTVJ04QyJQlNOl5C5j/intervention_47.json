I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for suggesting they sleep in separate rooms. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author is a light sleeper and their fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper who snores loudly and watches loud TV movies before bed. The fianc\u00e9 doesn't compromise much, even when he lowers the volume a bit. The author's sleep is severely affected every night, leading to them deciding to sleep in separate rooms. The fianc\u00e9 is upset, thinking it's a bad idea because they should share a bed as a couple.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. I need to consider both sides. The author's main issue is lack of sleep due to their partner's habits. Sleep is crucial for health and well-being. The fianc\u00e9, on the other hand, has his own sleep habits and may not realize the impact on the author. But the author's solution is to sleep separately, which is a big step. \n\nThe key points here are communication and compromise. Has the author tried all possible solutions before suggesting separate rooms? Maybe they could try white noise machines, earplugs, or different schedules. But the author mentions they've been dealing with this for years. If they've already tried everything and it's not working, then the author's decision might be justified. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9's reaction also matters. If he's resistant to change and sees separate rooms as the end of their relationship, that's a problem. However, the author's health and well-being should be a priority. \n\nIn relationships, both partners need to make adjustments. If one's needs are consistently ignored, it's reasonable to seek a solution that works for both. The author isn't trying to push the fianc\u00e9 out but wants to find a way to coexist without constant sleep deprivation. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might not be in the wrong. They're addressing a long-term issue that affects their quality of life. The fianc\u00e9's habits need to change, but if that's not happening, separate rooms could be a necessary step. Therefore, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
