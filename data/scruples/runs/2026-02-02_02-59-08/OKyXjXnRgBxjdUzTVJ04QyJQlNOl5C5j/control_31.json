I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nThey're engaged, been together 8 years, have two kids. The main issue is about sleeping in separate rooms because the fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper with loud snoring and watches TV loudly. The author is a light sleeper and can't handle the noise. They tried compromising before, but the fianc\u00e9 can't hear the TV if it's turned down, even in his sleep. The author finally had enough and suggested separate rooms. The fianc\u00e9 is upset, saying that if they can't share a bed, maybe they should just be roommates.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, the key here is about mutual respect and meeting each other's needs. The author wants a good night's sleep, which is a basic need. The fianc\u00e9's habits are causing significant disruption. The author tried to compromise by lowering the volume a bit, but it's not enough. Sleeping in separate rooms isn't about not wanting to be together, but about health and well-being. Chronic sleep deprivation can lead to health issues. The fianc\u00e9's argument that separate rooms mean just being roommates seems to misunderstand the author's intention. The goal is to coexist comfortably while being a couple, not to avoid each other. So, the author isn't in the wrong. They're advocating for their needs after trying to find solutions. The fianc\u00e9 needs to be more considerate. So the answer should be B.\n"
