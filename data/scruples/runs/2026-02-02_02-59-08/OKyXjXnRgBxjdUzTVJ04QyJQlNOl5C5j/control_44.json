I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for suggesting they sleep in separate rooms. The situation is that the author is a light sleeper, and their fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper who snores a lot and watches TV loudly before bed. The fianc\u00e9 can't hear the TV unless it's at a high volume, and he even argues about it while asleep. The author has been dealing with this for years, leading to poor sleep. Now they want to sleep separately.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's main issue is their sleep being disrupted, which affects their health and well-being. Chronic poor sleep can lead to various health problems. The fianc\u00e9's habits are causing this, and he seems resistant to changing them. The author has tried compromises, like the fianc\u00e9 lowering the volume a bit, but it's not enough. The fianc\u00e9, on the other hand, feels that separate rooms would make them just roommates, which suggests he sees the relationship's intimacy as tied to sharing a bedroom.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, wanting to sleep in a separate room to get rest is a reasonable request. It's a common issue in relationships where partners have conflicting sleep habits. The author isn't trying to push the fianc\u00e9 away but to address their own needs. The fianc\u00e9's reaction might stem from feeling that the author is rejecting him or not valuing their relationship. However, the author's health and well-being are valid concerns. \n\nThe key points here are mutual understanding and compromise. The author has tried some compromises but to no avail. The fianc\u00e9 hasn't adjusted his habits despite the negative impact on the author. The author is seeking a solution that benefits their health, which is essential for a healthy relationship. So, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to sleep separately. They're addressing a legitimate problem that's been ongoing. The fianc\u00e9 might need to adjust his habits or accept the separate sleeping arrangement. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
