I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for suggesting they sleep in separate rooms. The context is that the author is a light sleeper, and their fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper who watches loud TV shows while sleeping. The author can't take it anymore and wants separate rooms for better sleep. The fianc\u00e9 is upset, thinking it's the end of their relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has a valid reason: their health and well-being are affected by the lack of sleep. Chronic sleep issues can lead to serious health problems, so this is a legitimate concern. They've been dealing with this for 8 years, which is a long time. The fianc\u00e9, on the other hand, is used to his sleeping habits and might not see the problem. He might feel that the author is being selfish or that the solution is extreme.\n\nBut wait, relationships require compromise. The author has tried to communicate the issue for years without resolution. Maybe the fianc\u00e9 hasn't made enough effort to adjust his habits. The author's main goal is to get a good night's sleep, which is essential. However, moving to separate rooms is a big step. Are there other solutions they could have tried first? Like white noise machines, earplugs, or a sleep mask? Maybe the author didn't try all possible alternatives. But the fianc\u00e9's refusal to turn down the TV volume, even when asked, suggests he's not willing to adjust.\n\nAlso, considering the engagement and two kids, the author is looking for a long-term solution. If the fianc\u00e9 is unwilling to change, maybe separate rooms are necessary for the author's mental health. The fianc\u00e9's reaction is about the symbolism of sharing a bed, but the author's health is more critical. So, in this case, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They have a legitimate problem that needs to be addressed. The fianc\u00e9's response is more about the relationship's structure rather than solving the actual issue. The answer might be B, No, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
