I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The user is asking if suggesting to sleep in separate rooms is reasonable given the situation.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that they're a light sleeper and need a quiet environment. Their fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper who snores loudly and insists on having the TV on at a high volume. The fianc\u00e9 also watches action movies with lots of noise, which disrupts the author's sleep. Even when the fianc\u00e9 compromises by lowering the volume a bit, it's still too loud. The author has been dealing with this for a long time\u20148 years together, 1 year engaged, two kids. They finally had enough and suggested separate rooms. The fianc\u00e9 is upset, thinking it's the end of their relationship if they can't share a bed.\n\nSo, the main issue is the conflict between the author's need for a good night's sleep and the fianc\u00e9's habits. The author is trying to find a solution that works for both, but the fianc\u00e9 sees it as a step back from their relationship. The question is whether the author is at fault here.\n\nI need to consider both perspectives. From the author's side, chronic lack of sleep can be really harmful. They've tried to compromise, but the fianc\u00e9's habits are persistent and disruptive. The author is looking for a solution that prioritizes their health and well-being. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 might feel that the author is pushing for separation, which could be seen as a rejection. He might feel that the author is giving up on finding a solution that allows them to stay together. \n\nBut wait, the author hasn't given up entirely. They're just suggesting a temporary measure to address the sleep issue. The fianc\u00e9's reaction seems more about the symbolic meaning of separate rooms rather than the practical solution. Maybe they need to find a middle ground. However, the situation has been ongoing for a long time, and the author's health is a valid concern. \n\nIn relationships, both partners need to make compromises. The author is trying to find a solution that works for them, even if it's unconventional. The fianc\u00e9's habits are causing significant distress, and the author has tried to adjust as much as possible. If the fianc\u00e9 is unwilling to find another solution (like earplugs, white noise machines, or a different bedtime routine), then the author is left with the option of separate rooms to protect their own needs. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. They're seeking a solution to a long-standing problem that affects their well-being. The fianc\u00e9's reaction is more about the emotional impact rather than the practicality of the solution. Therefore, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
