I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for suggesting they sleep in separate rooms. The scenario is that the author is a light sleeper, and their fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper who watches loud TV shows while sleeping, causing the author to have poor sleep. The fianc\u00e9 is against the idea, thinking it's not a good idea for a couple to not share a room.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has a legitimate issue with sleep quality, which is crucial for health and well-being. Chronic sleep deprivation can lead to various health problems, so it's a valid concern. The fianc\u00e9's habits\u2014snoring loudly and watching TV at a high volume\u2014are clearly disruptive. The author has tried to communicate and compromise, like the fianc\u00e9 lowering the volume a bit, but the problem persists.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9's response is to question the relationship's validity if they can't share a bed. That's a bit extreme. Relationships do require compromise, and while sleeping in separate rooms might feel like a big step, it's a solution to a longstanding problem. The author has been in this situation for 8 years, which is a long time to endure poor sleep. \n\nNow, considering cultural or social norms, some people might view sleeping separately as a sign of marital problems, but others see it as a practical solution. The key here is that the author's health and well-being are being affected. If the fianc\u00e9 is unwilling to make necessary changes, the author isn't wrong to seek a solution that prioritizes their own needs. \n\nHowever, the author could have approached it differently. Maybe exploring other solutions first, like earplugs, white noise machines, or adjusting the TV setup. But given that the problem has been ongoing for so long and the fianc\u00e9's resistance to change, the author's decision might be justified. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a tough call. They are trying to address a significant issue affecting their health. The fianc\u00e9's side is also important, but if he's unwilling to adapt, the author isn't necessarily wrong to prioritize their needs. Therefore, the answer might be B (Not in the wrong). But maybe there's a middle ground. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong, and since they're acting to improve their quality of life, the answer leans towards B.\n"
