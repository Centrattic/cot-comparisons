I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for suggesting to their fianc\u00e9 they sleep in separate rooms. The main issue is their sleep quality versus his habits. The fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper, uses the TV loudly, and snoring is loud. The author is a light sleeper and has been dealing with this for years, leading to bad sleep and stress.\n\nFirst, I should consider both sides. The author's need for a good night's sleep is valid. Chronic sleep deprivation can have serious health impacts. They've tried compromising, like the fianc\u00e9 lowering the volume a bit, but it's not enough. The fianc\u00e9's argument is about the relationship's intimacy, suggesting that not sharing a bed is like just being roommates. But maybe that's a misunderstanding of what's happening. The author isn't saying to stop being a couple, just to find a solution that works for both.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9's habits might not be intentional. He might not realize how disruptive his TV and snoring are, especially since he's a heavy sleeper. The author has been dealing with this for 8 years, which is a long time. They have kids too, so their wellbeing is important. The author's action was a last resort after years of issues, which is understandable stress.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong? Well, they did communicate their needs and tried some compromises. The fianc\u00e9 isn't willing to make more significant changes. The author's main goal is their health and well-being, which is a strong point. If the fianc\u00e9 isn't open to other solutions, like maybe a white noise machine, separate beds in the same room, or other accommodations, then moving to separate rooms might be necessary. \n\nSo in this case, the author isn't in the wrong. They're advocating for their health after years of issues. The fianc\u00e9's reaction seems to be more about the symbolic aspect rather than addressing the real problem. Therefore, the answer would be B (not in the wrong).\n"
