I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a fianc\u00e9 who wants to sleep in separate rooms because the other partner's sleeping habits are affecting their rest. The author (the fianc\u00e9) is a light sleeper and can't handle the noise from the TV and snoring. The fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper, watches loud action movies with the TV on high volume, which causes the author to lose sleep.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. They've been together for 8 years, engaged for a year, and have two kids. The author has been dealing with this for a long time. The main issue is the noise from the TV and snoring. The author suggests separate rooms to get better sleep. The fianc\u00e9 disagrees, thinking it's bad for their relationship, comparing it to being roommates.\n\nNow, evaluating whether the author is in the wrong. The author's main concern is their health and well-being, needing rest. Chronic sleep deprivation can have serious health effects. The fianc\u00e9's habits are affecting that. The author is trying to find a solution that works for them. But the fianc\u00e9 sees it as a relationship issue, implying that sharing a bed is important for their partnership.\n\nIs there a middle ground? Maybe they could try different solutions first, like earplugs or white noise machines. But the author mentions that the fianc\u00e9 compromises by lowering the volume a bit, but still not enough. Also, the fianc\u00e9's sleep talking and waking up if the TV is turned down complicates things. The author might have felt that after years of trying, separate rooms are the only option left.\n\nIn relationships, both partners' needs should be considered. However, when one's basic health needs are not met, it's a significant issue. The author isn't trying to push the relationship away but to improve their quality of life. The fianc\u00e9's argument that not sharing a bed is akin to being roommates might not hold, as roommates can also have separate rooms for various reasons.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? I think they're justified in seeking better sleep, especially after prolonged issues. The fianc\u00e9's needs are valid too, but the author's health is a priority. Therefore, the answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
