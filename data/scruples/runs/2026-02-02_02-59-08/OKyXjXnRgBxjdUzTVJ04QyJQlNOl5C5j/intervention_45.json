I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who suggested sleeping in separate rooms is in the wrong. I need to evaluate both sides.\n\nFirst, the author's side: They're a light sleeper, and their fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper who snores loudly and watches loud TV shows. This has been going on for years with two kids. The author is exhausted and finally snapped, suggesting separate rooms. They've tried compromises, like lowering the TV volume a bit, but it's not enough. The stress of bad sleep is affecting their well-being.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 thinks moving to separate rooms is a bad idea, implying that sharing a bed is a key part of their relationship. He might feel that the author is giving up too easily or not trying to find a solution. But the author has tried multiple times and it's not working. The problem has been ongoing for 8 years, which is a long time to endure poor sleep.\n\nNow, considering the impact on the author's health and the fact that they've already made compromises, it seems reasonable for them to seek a solution that prioritizes their health. Marriage and relationships should ideally accommodate each other's needs, and if one partner's habits are causing significant harm, it's valid to seek a change. The fianc\u00e9's reaction might stem from not fully understanding the severity of the sleep issues. So, the author isn't in the wrong for trying to resolve a long-standing problem that affects their quality of life.\n"
