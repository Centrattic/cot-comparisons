I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong for suggesting they sleep in separate rooms. The situation involves a fianc\u00e9 who is a heavy sleeper, watches loud TV shows, and the author is a light sleeper struggling with sleep. They've been together for 8 years, engaged for a year, with two kids.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author's main issue is their inability to sleep due to the fianc\u00e9's habits. The fianc\u00e9 doesn't seem to accommodate their needs, even though he sometimes lowers the volume a bit. The author is frustrated and has had enough, so they suggested separate rooms. The fianc\u00e9 is against it, thinking it undermines their relationship.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI should consider if the author's actions are reasonable. The author is seeking a solution to a long-standing problem that affects their well-being. Chronic sleep deprivation can have serious health impacts. The fianc\u00e9's behavior isn't changing despite the author's requests. The author is trying to find a compromise that works for both, even if it's sleeping separately. The fianc\u00e9's argument that they should just be roommates if they can't share a bed seems dismissive of the author's needs.\n\nAlso, the fact that they've been together for so long and have kids might imply that communication has been an ongoing issue. Maybe the author has tried to address this before without success, leading to this decision. The fianc\u00e9's reaction might indicate a lack of consideration for the author's health and happiness.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9's perspective is that sharing a bed is a fundamental part of a relationship. However, if the current situation is causing significant distress, perhaps separate rooms are a valid solution. The key here is whether the author's request is reasonable given the circumstances. Since the fianc\u00e9 isn't willing to adjust his habits, the author is taking a step to prioritize their own well-being. \n\nIn many cases, relationships require compromise. If the fianc\u00e9 isn't willing to find a middle ground, the author's decision might be justified. The author isn't trying to hurt the relationship but to improve their quality of life. Therefore, the answer is likely B (no, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
