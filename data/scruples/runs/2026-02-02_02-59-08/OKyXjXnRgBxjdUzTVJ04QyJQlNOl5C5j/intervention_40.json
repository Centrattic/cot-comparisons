I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for suggesting sleeping in separate rooms. The background is that they're engaged, have two kids, been together for 8 years, engaged for a year. The main issue is the fianc\u00e9's sleep habits\u2014snoring, heavy sleeper, TV on loud. The author is a light sleeper, can't handle the noise. They tried compromising, but it's not working. The fianc\u00e9 is upset because he thinks if they can't share a bed, why not just be roommates. The author wants to sleep well.\n\nFirst, the user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to evaluate. So, the author's reasoning is about needing rest, which is important for their wellbeing. Chronic sleep deprivation can affect health, mood, and family life. The fianc\u00e9's habits are causing this. The author tried to communicate and compromise, but it's not working. So the author suggests separate rooms as a solution. \n\nIs that in the wrong? Well, the fianc\u00e9 might see it as a personal issue, but the author's health and the kids' environment matter. The fianc\u00e9's reaction seems to conflate sleeping arrangements with the relationship's validity, which isn't fair. The author's request is about their own health, not a rejection of the relationship. So the author isn't necessarily wrong. The fianc\u00e9 might need to find a solution that accommodates both, like a white noise machine, earplugs, or maybe the TV issue can be addressed differently. But if all else fails, separate rooms could be a valid option. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
