I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for suggesting they sleep in separate rooms. Let me read through the situation again to make sure I understand it.\n\nThe author is engaged to someone who's a heavy sleeper and snores loudly. The fianc\u00e9 watches action movies with loud sounds on the TV at high volume, even though the author can't sleep well with all that noise. The author tried to compromise by lowering the volume a bit, but it's still causing sleep issues. After years of this, the author decided to sleep in a separate room, and the fianc\u00e9 is upset about it. The author is worried they're in the wrong because the fianc\u00e9 sees it as a problem with their relationship rather than just being roommates.\n\nHmm. So the key points here are the author's need for a quiet sleep environment versus the fianc\u00e9's habits. The author has been dealing with this for a long time\u20148 years together, engaged for 1, with two kids. The fianc\u00e9's behavior is causing significant sleep disruption. The author is seeking a solution (separate rooms) to get proper rest. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 is resisting this solution, thinking it's a sign that their relationship isn't working.\n\nNow, the user is asking if the author is wrong. I need to decide between A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no, not in the wrong). \n\nFirst, I should consider the rights of both parties. The author has a legitimate need for rest, which is essential for health and well-being. Chronic sleep deprivation can lead to serious health issues. The fianc\u00e9's habits are causing this problem, and despite some minor compromises (lowering the volume a bit), the noise remains an issue. The author's proposal to sleep separately is a practical solution to address their needs. \n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 might feel that the proposal is a significant step that could strain their relationship. But the author is not suggesting ending the relationship; they're just seeking a way to coexist comfortably. The fianc\u00e9's reaction seems to conflate sleeping arrangements with the validity of the relationship, which might be an overreaction. \n\nIn many relationships, couples do choose to sleep in separate rooms for various reasons, including health or personal preferences. It's a common practice in some cultures and is increasingly accepted as a way to manage differing sleep needs. The author's decision is about their health and well-being, which is a valid reason. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9's argument that they could just be roommates if they don't share a bed seems a bit extreme. Being roommates doesn't necessarily mean the relationship is invalid. The core issue here is about mutual respect for each other's needs. The author is trying to communicate their needs, and the fianc\u00e9 is resistant. However, the author isn't the one causing the problem; they're the one trying to solve it. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They're addressing a legitimate problem that's affecting their quality of life. The fianc\u00e9's habits are the root cause, and the author is seeking a solution that's reasonable. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
