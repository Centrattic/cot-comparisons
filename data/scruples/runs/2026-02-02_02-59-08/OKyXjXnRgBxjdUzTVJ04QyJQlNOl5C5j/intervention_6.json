I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for suggesting sleeping in separate rooms. The situation is that the author is a light sleeper, and their fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper who watches loud TV shows, causing sleep issues. The fianc\u00e9 argues that sleeping separately makes the relationship pointless, but the author just wants to sleep well.\n\nHmm, first, I need to consider both sides. The author's main point is their need for a good night's sleep. Chronic sleep deprivation can have serious health effects, so that's a valid concern. The fianc\u00e9's habits are causing this, and the author is trying to find a solution. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 might feel that separate rooms are a step toward emotional distance or the end of the relationship. But the author mentions they've been together for 8 years and have two kids, so they're clearly committed. \n\nIs it reasonable for the author to seek a solution to their sleep problem? Maybe the fianc\u00e9 could adjust his habits. He says he can lower the volume a bit but not enough. Maybe he doesn't realize the impact of his actions on the author. The author tried to communicate, but when compromises aren't working, suggesting separate rooms might be a necessary step. \n\nHowever, the fianc\u00e9's reaction is also important. He's taking it as a rejection, which is understandable but might not be the right approach. The author is not suggesting ending the relationship, just finding a solution. The key here is whether the author is in the wrong for prioritizing their health. I think the author is justified because their well-being is important. The fianc\u00e9 needs to be more considerate. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
