I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for suggesting they sleep in separate rooms. The situation involves a long-term relationship with significant sleep issues.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author (fianc\u00e9) is a light sleeper and the other partner (fianc\u00e9e) is a heavy sleeper who needs the TV on loudly. The fianc\u00e9 has tried to compromise, but the noise from the TV and the snoring is causing consistent sleep problems. They've been together 8 years, engaged for 1, with two kids. The fianc\u00e9 feels they can't take it anymore and wants separate rooms. The fianc\u00e9e is unhappy with this suggestion, feeling it undermines their relationship.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. Sleep is a basic need, and lack of it affects health and well-being. The fianc\u00e9e's habits are causing significant distress. The author is trying to find a solution to a long-standing problem. However, moving to separate rooms might be seen as a drastic step. Have they tried other solutions first? The author mentions the fianc\u00e9e sometimes lowers the volume a bit, but it's still too loud. Maybe other compromises could be explored, like white noise machines, earplugs, or a different TV setup. But if all else fails, ensuring one's health by seeking a better sleep environment is reasonable.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9e might feel that the suggestion to separate rooms is a step towards the end of the relationship. The author is trying to address their needs, but the fianc\u00e9e's reaction suggests she feels unconsidered. However, the author's need for rest is valid. In a long-term relationship, both partners' needs should be considered. If they can't find a middle ground, separate rooms might be a necessary compromise, not a betrayal.\n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They're advocating for their well-being after years of poor sleep. The fianc\u00e9e's habits are the root cause, and the author is seeking a solution. The real issue might be communication and finding a compromise, but the author's action is a reasonable response to a persistent problem.\n"
