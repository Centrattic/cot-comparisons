I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is wrong for suggesting sleeping in separate rooms. The key points here are the couple's differing needs regarding sleep. The fianc\u00e9 is a light sleeper needing quiet, while the partner is a heavy sleeper with the TV on at a loud volume. They've been through this for 8 years, which is a long time. The fianc\u00e9 is exhausted and finally had enough.\n\nFirst, the fianc\u00e9's health and well-being are important. Chronic sleep deprivation can lead to health issues. The partner's habits are really affecting that. The fianc\u00e9 isn't being unreasonable by wanting to sleep in a quiet room. The partner, on the other hand, seems resistant to changing his habits, even after years of the issue. \n\nThe argument that separate rooms mean just being roommates is a bit of a red herring. Couples can live in separate rooms for various reasons\u2014different schedules, work demands, etc.\u2014and still have a healthy relationship. The fianc\u00e9 isn't rejecting the relationship but seeking a solution to a specific problem. \n\nAlso, considering they have two kids, the stress and lack of sleep might be affecting their ability to care for the children. The fianc\u00e9's request is about self-care, which is valid. The partner's resistance might stem from not realizing the severity of the issue or not wanting to change his habits. \n\nIn relationships, compromise is key. If the partner isn't willing to adjust his sleeping habits, the fianc\u00e9 is within her right to seek an alternative. The situation has been ongoing for too long without resolution, so her decision to prioritize her health isn't unreasonable. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
