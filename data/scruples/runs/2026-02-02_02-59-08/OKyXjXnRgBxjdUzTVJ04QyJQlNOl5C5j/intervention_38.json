I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for suggesting sleeping in separate rooms. The situation is that the fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper with a loud TV, causing the author sleep issues. They've been together a long time, have kids.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has a valid complaint about not getting enough sleep. Chronic lack of sleep can affect health and well-being. The fianc\u00e9's habits are disruptive. The author's solution is to sleep separately, which the fianc\u00e9 is resistant to. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9 argues that if they can't share a bed, then what's the point of being a couple. But that seems a bit extreme. It's possible to live together without sharing a bed, especially if it's necessary for one's health. Also, they have kids, so maybe there's already some separate spaces involved.\n\nThe author has tried to compromise before, like the fianc\u00e9 lowering the volume a bit. But it's not enough. The author's decision comes after years of this, so it's not a spur-of-the-moment thing. The fianc\u00e9's reaction seems to be about the relationship status rather than the actual issue of sleep. \n\nIn relationships, both partners need to make adjustments. However, when one's health is at stake, it's important to prioritize that. The author isn't suggesting moving out, just separate rooms in the same house. That's a common solution for couples with differing needs. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They're trying to address a long-standing problem that affects their quality of life. The fianc\u00e9's response is more about the symbolism of sharing a bed rather than practicality. Therefore, the answer should be B (not in the wrong).\n"
