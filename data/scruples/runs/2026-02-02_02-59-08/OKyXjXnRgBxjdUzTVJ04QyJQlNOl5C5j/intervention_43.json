I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong for suggesting to sleep in separate rooms. The situation involves the fianc\u00e9 being a heavy sleeper with loud snoring and needing the TV on loudly, causing the author's poor sleep.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author is a light sleeper, which makes sense. The fianc\u00e9's habits are causing consistent sleep issues. They've been together for 8 years with two kids, so this isn't a new problem. The author has tried compromising, like the fianc\u00e9 lowering the volume by a few points, but it's still not enough. The fianc\u00e9 argues that sleeping separately would mean they're just roommates, which is a common counterargument in these situations.\n\nNow, thinking about relationship dynamics. Communication is crucial. The author clearly expresses their need for a good night's sleep, which is a basic human need. The fianc\u00e9's habits are affecting the author's health and well-being, which can't be ignored. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 might feel that the author is prioritizing their own comfort over the relationship's traditional structure.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they tried to ask him to lower the volume, but he can't hear and gets upset when it's turned down. The author's solution is to sleep separately, which is a practical fix for their specific problem. However, the fianc\u00e9 feels it's a bad idea, implying that the author is rejecting the relationship. But if the author is sacrificing their health for the relationship, that might not be sustainable. \n\nIn many relationships, partners make compromises, but there's a limit when one person's needs are severely impacting the other. The author is trying to find a solution that works for both, but if sleeping separately is the only way to get rest, maybe it's justified. However, the fianc\u00e9's reaction might be valid because it's a significant change. But considering the long-term effects of poor sleep on health, the author's decision could be seen as reasonable.\n\nSo, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the author is addressing a legitimate health issue and seeking a solution, even if it's unconventional. The fianc\u00e9's perspective is understandable, but the author's need for rest is also important.\n"
