I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids.

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for suggesting they sleep in separate rooms. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe author is engaged to someone with two kids. They've been together for eight years and engaged for a year. The main issue is their partner's snoring and the TV at night. The author is a light sleeper and needs quiet to sleep. The partner is a heavy sleeper, snores loudly, and insists on having the TV on at a loud volume, even though he sometimes lowers it a bit. The partner even turns it down when the author asks, but the problem persists. The author finally had enough and suggested sleeping in separate rooms, and the partner is upset about it, thinking it's not necessary.\n\nFirst, let's consider the rights of both parties. The author's need for a good night's sleep is important for their health and well-being. Chronic sleep deprivation can lead to various health issues, so this is a valid concern. On the other hand, the partner has his own preferences\u2014he's a heavy sleeper and uses the TV as a way to fall asleep. Maybe it's a coping mechanism or something he's accustomed to.\n\nThe author tried to compromise before, like the partner lowering the volume a bit. But even after that, the problem continues. The author's decision to move to separate rooms is a way to address their own needs after long-term frustration. The partner's reaction is that it's the end of the relationship if they can't share a bed, which seems a bit extreme. Maybe he's projecting his feelings or not considering the author's perspective.\n\nIn relationships, mutual respect and finding solutions are key. The author isn't suggesting a breakup but a physical separation to improve their sleep. It's a practical solution. The partner's resistance might be more about feeling that the author doesn't want to be close, but the author's reason is health-related. It's possible that the partner isn't acknowledging the author's legitimate needs. \n\nAre there other possible solutions? Maybe the author could look into earplugs or a white noise machine, but those might not be effective if the TV is too loud. The partner could also try alternative methods to sleep without the TV, like a white noise app or a sleep mask. However, the author has tried negotiating and the partner hasn't made significant changes. \n\nConsidering the long-term effects, the author's health is at stake. If the partner isn't willing to adjust, then the author's decision to sleep separately isn't unreasonable. It's about maintaining their own well-being, which is crucial in any relationship. The partner's reaction might stem from not understanding the severity of the sleep issues, but that doesn't make the author wrong for seeking a solution.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. They have a legitimate reason based on their health needs and have tried to find a compromise without success. The partner's resistance seems more about the emotional aspect rather than addressing the practical issue. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
