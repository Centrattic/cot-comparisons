I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for suggesting they sleep in separate rooms. The situation is that the fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper who snores a lot and watches loud TV shows before bed. The author is a light sleeper and can't sleep well because of this. They've tried compromises, but it's not working, so they want to move to separate rooms. The fianc\u00e9 is upset, thinking it's a bad idea for a couple.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author has been dealing with this for 8 years, including being engaged for 1 year and having two kids. The fianc\u00e9's habits are really disruptive\u2014snoring like a train and watching loud TV. The author tried to lower the volume, but the fianc\u00e9 can't hear it when it's turned down. The author is exhausted and finally had enough. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). Let's break it down. The author is seeking a solution to a long-standing problem that's affecting their health and well-being. Sleep is essential, and chronic lack of it can be serious. The fianc\u00e9 isn't being accommodating, and their habits are causing real harm. The author's request for separate rooms is a last-resort solution after compromises haven't worked.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that moving to separate rooms is extreme and could be seen as a step back from the relationship. But given the circumstances\u20148 years of this, two kids, and the fianc\u00e9's inability to adjust\u2014it's a reasonable request for the author's well-being. The fianc\u00e9's reaction seems to be more about feeling rejected rather than understanding the health issue. \n\nThe author isn't trying to end the relationship but to improve their quality of life. It's a common issue, and many couples do choose separate rooms for various reasons, especially when it's necessary for health. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. The fianc\u00e9's habits are the root problem, not the author's suggestion to separate for better rest."
