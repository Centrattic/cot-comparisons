I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who asked the AITA (Am I the Asshole) question is in the wrong. The situation is about the author suggesting they sleep in separate rooms because the fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper with loud snoring and watches loud TV shows before bed. The author is a light sleeper and can't handle the noise.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's main issue is their inability to sleep due to the fianc\u00e9's habits. They've been dealing with this for 8 years, which is a long time. Chronic lack of sleep can have serious health impacts, so that's a valid concern. The fianc\u00e9, on the other hand, is used to his routine and sees sleeping together as a fundamental part of being a couple, not just roommates.\n\nThe author's decision to sleep separately might be seen as a last resort after years of trying to adjust. They mention that the fianc\u00e9 doesn't compromise much, only lowering the volume slightly. The author's main goal is to get rest, which is essential for their well-being. However, the fianc\u00e9 feels that sleeping separately undermines their relationship, implying that physical intimacy and shared space are important for them.\n\nNow, thinking about typical AITA responses, people often consider the health and well-being of the individuals involved. Chronic sleep deprivation is a significant issue, and if one partner's habits are causing that without reasonable compromise, the other partner may have a right to seek a solution. The fianc\u00e9's habits are affecting the author's health, which is a strong point in their favor.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9's perspective is that sleeping separately is a drastic step. Some might argue that there are other solutions first, like earplugs, white noise machines, or medical interventions for snoring. But the author has already tried some compromises (like the fianc\u00e9 lowering the TV volume a bit) and it's still not enough. The author's frustration is understandable after 8 years of this.\n\nIn many AITA scenarios, the person seeking a solution for their own well-being without causing unnecessary harm isn't considered the asshole. The key here is whether the author's action was a reasonable response to a long-standing problem. Since the author's health is at stake and they've tried some adjustments, it's more about finding a middle ground. The fianc\u00e9's resistance might stem from not wanting to change his habits, which could be seen as selfish if it's affecting the other person's health.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author is likely not in the wrong. Their action is a reasonable step to prioritize their health and well-being after enduring the situation for a long time. The fianc\u00e9's habits are the root cause here, and the author is seeking a solution that allows both to coexist without harm. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
