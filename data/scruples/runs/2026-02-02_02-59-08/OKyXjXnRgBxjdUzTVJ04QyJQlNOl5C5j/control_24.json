I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for suggesting separate rooms. The author is a light sleeper, their fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper who snores a lot and sleeps with the TV on. They've been dealing with this for 8 years and have two kids.\n\nFirst, the author's main issue is sleep quality. Chronic lack of good sleep can affect health and well-being. They've tried compromises, like the fianc\u00e9 lowering the volume slightly, but it's not enough. The fianc\u00e9's argument is about the relationship's validity if they can't share a bed, implying it's a deal-breaker.\n\nBut the author's request is about their basic need for rest. The fianc\u00e9's habits are affecting the author's health. The fact that they've been together so long and this is a recurring issue suggests it's not a new or minor problem. The author isn't rejecting the relationship, just seeking a better living arrangement for their well-being. The fianc\u00e9's reaction seems more about the principle of sharing a bed rather than solving the problem. \n\nSeparate rooms don't have to mean the end of the relationship. Many couples do this for various reasons. The author is prioritizing their health, which is important. The fianc\u00e9 might need to be more considerate of the author's needs. So the author isn't necessarily in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
