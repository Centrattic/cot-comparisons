I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is at fault for suggesting they sleep in separate rooms. The person is a light sleeper and their fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper who plays loud TV. They've been dealing with this for years, leading to bad sleep. The fianc\u00e9 argues that if they can't share a bed, they might as well be roommates.\n\nFirst, the author's main issue is their sleep being disrupted. They've tried compromising, like lowering the volume a bit, but it's not enough. The fianc\u00e9's habits are causing consistent problems. The author is seeking a solution that prioritizes their health and well-being, which is important. \n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 sees separate rooms as a sign of not being a proper couple. But the relationship's foundation is about mutual respect and care. If one partner's needs aren't met, it's a valid concern. The author isn't being selfish; they're trying to address a long-standing issue that affects their quality of life. \n\nConsidering the duration (8 years together) and the impact on health, the author's request seems reasonable. The fianc\u00e9's resistance might stem from not understanding the severity of the problem or not seeing it as a big issue. However, the author's right to a good night's sleep is valid. So, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
