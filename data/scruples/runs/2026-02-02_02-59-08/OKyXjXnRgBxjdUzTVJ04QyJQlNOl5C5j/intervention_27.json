I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for suggesting they sleep in separate rooms. Their fianc\u00e9's a heavy sleeper, uses the TV on loud, which disturbs them. They've been dealing with this for a long time and finally had enough.\n\nHmm, so the key points are the sleep disturbance. The fianc\u00e9 can't hear the TV unless it's loud, and the author can't sleep with all that noise. They've been together 8 years, engaged for 1, and have two kids. The author is a light sleeper, so this is a recurring issue causing bad sleep. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9's reaction is that they might as well be roommates if they don't share a bed. But the author just wants rest. I need to consider both sides. The fianc\u00e9's sleeping habits are causing harm to the author's well-being. Chronic sleep issues can affect health, mood, and relationships. The author is trying to find a solution after years of this. \n\nIs suggesting separate rooms a valid solution? Maybe they could have tried other solutions first, like a white noise machine or earplugs. But the fianc\u00e9's TV habit seems ingrained, and the author might not be able to adjust further. If the author's health is suffering, maybe the solution of separate rooms is reasonable. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9's argument that they might as well be roommates seems dismissive of the author's needs. A healthy relationship should accommodate each other's needs, even if it means some compromise. If the author's well-being is at stake, maybe they're not in the wrong. \n\nSo, the author is not in the wrong because they're addressing a long-term problem affecting their health. The fianc\u00e9's habits are the root cause. So the answer would be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
