I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about the fianc\u00e9 suggesting they sleep in separate rooms because of their partner's snoring and TV habits. They've been together for a long time, have kids, and the fianc\u00e9 is a light sleeper.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author is a light sleeper and needs quiet to sleep. The fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper, uses the TV at high volume, which causes noise. The author tried to compromise by having the fianc\u00e9 lower the volume a bit, but it's still a problem. The author then suggests separate rooms, which the fianc\u00e9 sees as a problem for their relationship.\n\nSo, the key points here: the author is trying to get a good night's sleep, which is a basic need. The fianc\u00e9's habits are causing significant disruption. The author has been dealing with this for years. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 might feel that the author is overreacting or that sleeping separately is not ideal for their marriage.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know others' opinions. The fianc\u00e9's reasoning is that if they can't share a bed, what's the point of being a couple. But relationships often require compromises. If the fianc\u00e9 is not willing to adjust his habits despite the author's needs, maybe the author is justified in seeking a solution, even if it's separate rooms.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that the fianc\u00e9 can't hear the TV when it's lower, so he turns it back up. It seems like the fianc\u00e9 isn't making a real effort to accommodate the author's needs. The author has tried to compromise by lowering the volume a bit, but it's not enough. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might not be in the wrong. They are seeking a solution to a long-standing problem that affects their health and well-being. The fianc\u00e9's argument about being roommates ignores the fact that they are in a committed relationship with kids, and the author's need for rest is valid. The fianc\u00e9 might need to find another way to address his sleep habits, like using earplugs or a white noise machine instead of the TV. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong) because they are advocating for their own well-being in a long-term relationship where the other partner isn't meeting their needs.\n"
