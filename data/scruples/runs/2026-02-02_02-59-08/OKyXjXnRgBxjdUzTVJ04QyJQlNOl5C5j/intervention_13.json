I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for suggesting they sleep in separate rooms. The situation involves a fianc\u00e9 with a heavy sleeper who has a TV on at night, causing the author to lose sleep. The author wants to sleep in another room to get better rest.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is a light sleeper, which is a valid issue. Chronic sleep deprivation can have health impacts, so their frustration makes sense. The fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper who needs the TV on, which he can't seem to adjust properly. The author has tried compromising, like lowering the volume slightly, but it's still causing problems.\n\nThe key points here are the long-term impact of the fianc\u00e9's habits. They've been together for 8 years, engaged for 1, with two kids. The author has endured this for a long time. The fianc\u00e9's response seems to view the suggestion as a relationship issue rather than a solution to a specific problem. He argues that if they can't share a bed, they might as well be roommates. That's a bit dismissive of the author's needs.\n\nIn relationships, both partners need to make compromises. The author is asking for something that's essential for their well-being. The fianc\u00e9's habits are affecting the author's health and quality of life. While it's ideal to share a room, sometimes practical solutions are necessary. Suggesting separate rooms isn't about wanting to be roommates but about finding a way to coexist without one's health suffering.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9's inability to adjust his sleeping habits, even with some compromises, might mean the author has a valid reason to seek an alternative. The author isn't wrong for prioritizing their health. So, the answer would be B\u2014author isn't in the wrong. They're trying to find a solution to a legitimate issue caused by the fianc\u00e9's habits that haven't been resolved through prior compromises.\n"
