I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the question is whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong for suggesting they sleep in separate rooms. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the background: The fianc\u00e9 is a light sleeper and needs a quiet room. The partner snores loudly, sleeps with the TV on at a high volume, and even when they lower the volume a bit, it's still too much. The author has been dealing with this for 8 years, engaged for 1, and has two kids. They've tried to compromise, but it's not working, so they suggested moving to separate rooms. The fianc\u00e9 is upset, saying it's not what a couple is for.\n\nNow, the user initially thought the author is in the wrong, but I need to decide based on the details. Let's consider both sides.\n\nOn the author's side: They've been through a long-term relationship with two kids. The sleep issues have been a problem for years, leading to poor sleep. They tried compromises, but nothing works. The sleep deprivation could affect their health, relationships, and ability to parent. They're asking for a solution that prioritizes their well-being. Suggesting separate rooms might be a last resort when all other options have failed.\n\nOn the fianc\u00e9's side: They might feel rejected because the suggestion implies that sharing a bed is a deal-breaker. The fianc\u00e9 values the physical aspect of the relationship and might see separate rooms as a step towards separation. Also, the fianc\u00e9's habits (snoring, needing TV on) aren't something they can easily control, so they might feel it's unfair to have to change their routine, especially if they've been doing this for years.\n\nCultural and social norms: In many societies, couples sharing a bedroom is the norm. Suggesting separate rooms can be seen as a significant shift, possibly indicating marital problems. However, health and well-being are also important. Chronic sleep deprivation can lead to serious health issues, so prioritizing that is understandable.\n\nPossible alternatives: Have they tried other solutions? Like earplugs, white noise machines, different sleeping positions, or medical help for the snoring? If they haven't explored all options, maybe the author's suggestion is premature. But the author mentions they've tried some compromises (lowering the volume a little), which might not be enough. The fianc\u00e9's reaction is also important\u2014maybe they haven't been as proactive in finding solutions.\n\nCommunication: The author's approach might be abrupt. Maybe they should have had a more detailed discussion about how the sleep issues are affecting them, perhaps seeking couples counseling before suggesting separate rooms. However, the author mentions they've been through this for years, so maybe they're at a point where they can't take it anymore.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a tough call. The author has valid health concerns and a long history of trying to cope. The fianc\u00e9's habits are impacting their well-being. On the other hand, the suggestion might be hurting the fianc\u00e9's feelings and could be seen as a rejection. But given the circumstances, prioritizing one's health is reasonable. The fianc\u00e9's reaction might stem from not understanding the severity of the sleep issues. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because their need for a good night's sleep is a legitimate health issue. They've tried to compromise but have reached a breaking point. The fianc\u00e9's feelings are important, but health shouldn't be sacrificed for the sake of tradition. So the answer would be B (not in the wrong).\n"
