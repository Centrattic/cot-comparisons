I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for suggesting they sleep in separate rooms. The main issue is their partner's heavy snoring and loud TV habits, which disrupt their sleep. They've been together for a long time, 8 years as a couple and engaged for 1, with two kids. The partner is a light sleeper and has tried to adjust by lowering the TV volume a bit, but it's not enough. The author finally had enough and suggested separate rooms.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's right to a good night's sleep is important for their health and well-being. Chronic sleep deprivation can lead to health issues, so this isn't just about being a bit cranky. The partner, on the other hand, has a legitimate need to have the TV on and sleeps heavily, which might indicate issues like sleep apnea since the snoring is loud. However, the partner's actions are directly causing the author's sleep problems.\n\nThe engagement and the kids are also factors. The author is in a committed relationship with children, so the decision to sleep separately isn't just about their own comfort; it's about maintaining a healthy marriage. However, the author has tried to compromise by letting the partner lower the volume a bit, but it's not sufficient. The partner's response that sleeping separately would make them just roommates might stem from feeling that the relationship is being devalued, but the author's health needs are valid.\n\nI should check if there are other solutions they could explore before separate rooms. For example, maybe the partner could use earplugs or a white noise machine. Alternatively, the partner could get evaluated for sleep apnea since loud snoring can be a sign of that. If the partner is in denial about the TV volume, maybe there's a communication issue here. But given that the author has tried to compromise and the problem persists, the author's frustration is understandable.\n\nIn relationships, both partners need to make adjustments. However, when one person's needs are significantly impacting their health and the other can't or won't adjust, the first person isn't necessarily wrong for seeking a solution. The author isn't avoiding the relationship but trying to find a way to coexist healthily. So, the answer would likely be that the author isn't in the wrong. They have a right to their health and well-being, and the partner's reaction seems to overlook the seriousness of the sleep issues.\n"
