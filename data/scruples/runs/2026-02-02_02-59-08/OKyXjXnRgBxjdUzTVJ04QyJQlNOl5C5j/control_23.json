I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for suggesting they sleep in separate rooms. The situation is that the author is a light sleeper, their fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper who snores loudly and watches action movies at high volume with the TV on. This has been going on for years, and the author is finally fed up, leading them to propose separate rooms.\n\nFirst, I need to assess both sides. The author's main issue is their inability to get good sleep due to noise. Chronic sleep deprivation can have serious health effects, so that's a valid concern. The fianc\u00e9, on the other hand, has his own habits that are difficult to change. He's a heavy sleeper, which makes adjusting the volume during the movie problematic. He also seems to believe that sharing a bed is essential for their relationship, implying that separate rooms would be like being roommates rather than a couple.\n\nNow, considering societal norms and relationship dynamics. In many relationships, partners make compromises for each other's well-being. The author has been putting up with this for 8 years, which is a long time. The fianc\u00e9's behavior isn't just a minor inconvenience; it's affecting the author's health and quality of life. The suggestion to sleep separately isn't a sudden decision but a last resort after enduring the situation for a long time.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9's argument that not sharing a bed undermines the relationship might be based on traditional views of intimacy. However, the core of a relationship is mutual respect and care. If one partner's habits are causing significant harm, the other has the right to seek solutions that prioritize their well-being. The author isn't rejecting the relationship but seeking a way to maintain it while addressing a critical personal need.\n\nPossible alternatives could include using earplugs or white noise machines, but the author might have tried these already. The fianc\u00e9's resistance to lowering the volume even slightly (only by 3 points) suggests he's not making reasonable accommodations. The author's decision isn't about wanting to avoid the partner but about needing to take care of their health, which is a valid priority.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, both partners should be willing to adjust. However, when one's needs are being consistently ignored, it's understandable to take the step of separate sleeping arrangements. The author isn't in the wrong for advocating for their own well-being, especially after enduring the situation for so long. The fianc\u00e9's reaction might stem from not fully understanding the severity of the issue or not having considered the long-term impact on the author's health.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is not in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
