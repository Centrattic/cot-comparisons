I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So the user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for suggesting to sleep in separate rooms. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author mentions being a light sleeper and needing a quiet environment. Their fianc\u00e9 is a heavy sleeper, snores loudly, and watches TV at a high volume. The fianc\u00e9 can't hear the author turning down the TV even when he's asleep. The author has been dealing with this for 8 years, with engagement for 1 year and two kids. They've had enough and suggested separate rooms, but the fianc\u00e9 is against it, thinking it's just like being roommates.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are the impact on the author's sleep and their well-being. Chronic sleep issues can lead to health problems, stress, and affect family life. The fianc\u00e9's habits are disruptive, and the author is seeking a solution. The fianc\u00e9's response seems to be about the relationship's validity rather than addressing the problem.\n\nBut wait, maybe there are other solutions? Like earplugs, white noise machines, or adjusting the TV setup. But the author says they've tried lowering the volume a bit, but it's not enough. Also, the fianc\u00e9's response is dismissive, which might indicate a lack of willingness to compromise.\n\nThe author's main goal is to get a good night's sleep. Shouldn't their health and well-being be a priority? The fianc\u00e9's argument that sleeping separately is equivalent to being roommates is a bit extreme. Many couples choose separate rooms for various reasons, including health or personal preferences. It's their choice as a couple, but the author is at a point where the current arrangement isn't sustainable.\n\nHowever, the author could have approached this with more discussion and compromise. Maybe trying other solutions first. But given that they've tried some adjustments and it's been a long-standing issue, suggesting separate rooms isn't unreasonable. The fianc\u00e9's reaction is more about the relationship's dynamic than solving the problem.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They're advocating for their needs after enduring the situation for years. The fianc\u00e9's habits are the root cause here, and the author seeks a reasonable solution. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong).\n"
