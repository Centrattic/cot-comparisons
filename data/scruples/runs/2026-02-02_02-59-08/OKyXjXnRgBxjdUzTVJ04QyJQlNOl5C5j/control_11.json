I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong for suggesting they sleep in separate rooms. The situation is that the fianc\u00e9 is a light sleeper and can't handle the noise from the TV and snoring of their partner. The partner is a heavy sleeper, watches loud movies, and keeps the TV on at half volume. The author is frustrated and decided to sleep separately after a long time of dealing with this.\n\nFirst, I need to assess both sides. The author's main issue is their sleep being disturbed consistently. They've been dealing with this for 8 years, which is a long time. The fianc\u00e9 doesn't seem to be making enough accommodations. Lowering the volume by 3 points isn't enough for the author. The fianc\u00e9 argues that sleeping separately would make them just roommates, which is a common counterargument in such situations.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the key factors here are mutual respect and compromise. The author is seeking a basic need for rest, which is essential for health. The fianc\u00e9's habits are affecting the author's well-being. The author's solution is to sleep separately, which is a common solution for couples with incompatible sleep habits. The fianc\u00e9's response about being roommates might be a bit dismissive, as separate rooms don't necessarily negate the relationship; many couples do this for various reasons without it affecting their commitment.\n\nThe author isn't being unreasonable here. They've tried to compromise but have reached their limit. The fianc\u00e9's habits are causing significant distress. So, the author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing their health and happiness. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
