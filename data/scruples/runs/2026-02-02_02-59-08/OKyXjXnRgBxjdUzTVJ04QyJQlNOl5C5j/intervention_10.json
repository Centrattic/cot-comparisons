I'm a light sleeper and prefer to have a quiet bedroom at night with no noise or distractions such as the TV.\nHe's a heavy sleeper, could probably fall asleep in 2.5 seconds in the middle of a rock concert and snores as loud as a train. Also he says he has to sleep with the TV on with the volume at about half of its potential. Although sometimes he compromises and lowers the volume about 3 points.\n\nEvery night, guaranteed, he will put on some stupid action movie with lots of explosions, gunshots, yelling and carcrashes then happily fall asleep while I'm tossing and turning. If I turn it down he'll wake up saying he can't hear it.... *in his sleep*\n\nTonight I had had enough of having shitty sleeps and went psycho and told him from now on, I'm sleeping in a separate room.\n\nHe thinks this is a terrible idea and that if we can't share a bed at night then what's the point of being a couple when we could just be roommates instead. But I just want a good night's sleep for once!\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nI'll add this for good measure. We've been together 8 years, engaged for 1 with 2 kids. I've been dealing with this for what feels like forever.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author suggesting to sleep in separate rooms due to their partner's loud snoring and TV habits. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the problem. The author is a light sleeper and can't handle the noise from the TV and the partner's snoring. The partner is a heavy sleeper and uses the TV loudly to fall asleep. They've been together for 8 years, engaged for a year, with two kids. The author has had enough and wants separate rooms, but the partner thinks that's not a good idea.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides. Let's break it down. The author's main issue is sleep deprivation due to their partner's habits. They've tried compromising, like the partner lowering the volume a bit, but it's not enough. The author's health and well-being are at stake here. Chronic lack of sleep can lead to various health issues, so that's a valid concern.\n\nOn the other hand, the partner sees sleeping separately as a problem for the relationship. They argue that if they can't share a bed, it's like being roommates. But the author is prioritizing their own well-being. It's a common issue in long-term relationships where different needs arise. The author has been dealing with this for years, so it's not a sudden change.\n\nI should consider whether there are other solutions. Maybe the partner could use earplugs or a white noise machine. But the author mentions that the partner falls asleep in a loud environment, so maybe they can't adjust. Also, the partner's snoring is a physical issue that might need medical attention, which the author hasn't addressed yet. \n\nHowever, the author's right to a good night's sleep is important. Relationships require compromise, but if one person's needs are consistently not met, it's reasonable to seek a solution. Sleeping separately isn't ideal, but if it's the only way for the author to get rest, it's understandable. The partner's reaction seems more about the principle of not sharing a bed rather than addressing the root problem.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong because their health is being affected. The partner should be more considerate and find a middle ground instead of opposing the solution outright. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
