Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking whether the author did the right thing by breaking up with his girlfriend and kicking her out because she couldn't pay rent. Let's look at the details.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend moved in in June 2018, and for six months she wasn't paying rent or bills. The author mentions she helped with cleaning occasionally, but it wasn't equal. Then when they moved in together, they split the rent initially. But then she stopped paying due to her own debts. The author ended up paying the full rent, which put him in a tough financial spot. Now she's not paying again and says she doesn't need to because she has a boyfriend. The author kicks her out, and she claims it was a test to see how he'd react in a crisis.\n\nSo, from the author's perspective, he's being fair by splitting the rent when they moved in together but she's not contributing, leading to financial strain. He feels it's unfair to pay full rent when he's already had to manage his own debts. The girlfriend's refusal to contribute and her justification that it's a test might be problematic. \n\nLegally, if they were in a lease together, both would be responsible for the rent. If she's not paying, he might still be liable, but splitting the payment is common. However, the author's decision to kick her out could be a personal choice based on their agreement. If they had an agreement to split the rent, her not paying breaches that. But he might be within his rights to ask her to leave if the financial burden is unsustainable for him. \n\nThe girlfriend's attitude that the guy should pay for everything might be a red flag. The author tried to help before, but her continued lack of contribution is causing issues. The author's reaction, while harsh, could be seen as a way to protect his financial stability. However, breaking up and evicting someone abruptly might be considered extreme. \n\nOn the other hand, the author could have handled it differently, like setting clear financial boundaries or discussing responsibilities upfront. But given the repeated issues and her not taking accountability, his actions might be justified. The girlfriend's test scenario is questionable because using a relationship to test someone's financial commitment isn't healthy. \n\nIn terms of morality, it's a bit of a gray area. The author is prioritizing his own financial health, which is important. The girlfriend's behavior shows a lack of consideration for his situation. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The answer would likely be B (No).\n"
