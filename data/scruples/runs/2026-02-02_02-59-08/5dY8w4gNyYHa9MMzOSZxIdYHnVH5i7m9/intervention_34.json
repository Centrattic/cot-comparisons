Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So, the user is asking whether the person who broke up with his girlfriend for not paying rent is in the wrong. The story says he's upset because she didn't contribute equally financially, especially after moving in together. He's paying the rent while she's dealing with her own debts, and he's angry that she's not helping out.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the financial agreements in a relationship. When two people live together, it's common to split expenses like rent. If one person can't pay because of their debts, that's a problem. But is it fair for one partner to expect the other to cover all the costs? The author mentions he believed the guy should pay for most things, but there should be give and take. However, in this case, after moving in, she wasn't contributing anything once her debts came up. That seems like a big issue.\n\nThen there's the breakup part. He kicked her out. Is that justified? If they were in a relationship and sharing an apartment, maybe there's an understanding about financial responsibilities. If she's unable to pay her share due to her own financial issues, he might feel betrayed or taken advantage of. He's in a precarious financial situation because he's paying all the rent. But was breaking up and evicting her the right move? Maybe he should have tried to discuss and find a solution, like adjusting the rent split or helping her with budgeting. However, if she wasn't willing to contribute at all, that's a problem.\n\nThe girlfriend's reasoning is also questionable. She says it was a test to see how he'd react in a tough situation, like an accident. But that's not a real emergency. Expecting a partner to cover all expenses without any reciprocity isn't fair. The author felt like he overstepped by kicking her out, but maybe he's justified because she wasn't meeting her responsibilities. \n\nOn the other hand, relationships require compromise. If he was okay with paying for most things before, but the arrangement changed when they moved in together, maybe there was a miscommunication. However, after she consistently failed to contribute, he might feel it's necessary to end the relationship. \n\nI think the key points are responsibility in relationships, financial agreements, and communication. The author might be right in expecting some form of contribution from his partner, especially when living together. Kicking her out was harsh, but if she wasn't willing to pay her share, maybe it's a valid decision. Still, handling it through communication first would have been better. The girlfriend's attitude of expecting the guy to pay everything is problematic. \n\nIn the end, I think the author isn't in the wrong because he had legitimate concerns about the financial imbalance. However, there's a nuance. If he had discussed it earlier and tried to find a solution, it might have been better. But given the circumstances, his decision to end the relationship might be justified. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
