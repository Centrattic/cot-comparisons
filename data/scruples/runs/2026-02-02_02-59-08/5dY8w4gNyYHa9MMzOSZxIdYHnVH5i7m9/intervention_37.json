Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for breaking up and kicking their girlfriend out because she couldn't pay rent. The options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author's girlfriend moved in with him, and they were splitting rent. Then she couldn't pay her share due to her debts. The author paid the full rent, which put him in a tough financial spot. Now she can't pay again, and when he confronts her, she says \"why do I have a boyfriend then?\" implying he should take care of her. The author kicks her out, and she later says it was a test.\n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know my opinion. I need to consider both sides. On one hand, the author might feel entitled to support, but financial responsibility in a relationship can be a gray area. On the other hand, expecting one partner to cover all expenses without reciprocity can be unfair. \n\nThe girlfriend moving in and not contributing to rent is a significant issue. Even if she's in debt, living rent-free in someone else's apartment when they can't pay their share might be unreasonable. The author tried to split the rent initially, but when that failed, he had to cover it. The girlfriend's attitude of expecting the guy to pay everything, even when she can't meet her obligations, seems problematic. \n\nHowever, the final confrontation where she says \"why do I have a boyfriend then?\" suggests she might not have realized the impact of her actions. The author's reaction was to end the relationship, which could be seen as a response to her not valuing his financial situation. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the girlfriend couldn't pay due to her own debts, maybe the author had a right to ask her to leave if she couldn't contribute. However, kicking someone out suddenly could be harsh, but given the financial strain, maybe it's justified. \n\nThe girlfriend's statement about it being a test seems like an excuse, which might make her more at fault. The author's actions were to protect his own financial stability, which is reasonable. So, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. \n\nBut relationships involve compromise. If the author was paying for most things expecting some give and take, and she wasn't meeting that, maybe the breakup is justified. The key is whether the author overstepped by kicking her out without a more collaborative solution. However, given the recurring issues and lack of reciprocity, the author's decision might be seen as self-preservation. \n\nI think the answer is B (not in the wrong) because the author is setting boundaries for his own financial well-being after repeated failures to meet obligations. The girlfriend's attitude and lack of contribution are significant factors here.\n"
