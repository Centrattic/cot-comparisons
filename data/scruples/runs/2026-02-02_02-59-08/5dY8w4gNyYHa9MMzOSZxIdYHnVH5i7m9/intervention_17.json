Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a breakup where the author kicked his girlfriend out because she couldn't pay rent. They had been in a relationship where he paid for most things, including rent after she moved in. Now, she's unable to contribute financially, and he feels it's unfair, leading to the breakup.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author believes he's justified because he's been supporting her financially, and she's not pulling her weight. He mentions that he's in a tough spot financially and that her inability to pay rent is causing him additional stress. On the other hand, the girlfriend might see this as part of the relationship's dynamics where the guy is supposed to pay for things, and maybe she's facing her own financial issues beyond her control.\n\nThe key points here are financial responsibility in a relationship, mutual contribution, and communication. The author's actions led to the breakup, which is a significant decision. Did he overreact? Well, he did kick her out of his apartment, which is a major step. However, if the relationship was built on him covering most expenses and she couldn't maintain that, maybe he had valid reasons. But relationships usually require some compromise. The girlfriend's approach of not paying rent and expecting him to cover it might be unreasonable, especially when it's affecting his financial stability.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. Maybe they believe that the author should have handled it differently, like discussing the financial issues before resorting to kicking her out. Or perhaps they think that the girlfriend had her own issues and the author should have been more understanding. Alternatively, the user might feel that the author's expectation of equality in financial contributions was reasonable.\n\nThe girlfriend's test statement adds another layer. If she was testing his reaction, maybe she wasn't being honest about her situation. That could be seen as manipulative. But the author's response was to kick her out immediately, which might be too harsh. However, if she's consistently not contributing and it's causing him financial strain, maybe his reaction is justified.\n\nFinancial responsibilities in a relationship can be complex. Each person's values and expectations matter. If both were aware of these expectations from the start, it's a communication issue. The author did mention that he believed the guy should pay for most, but there should be give and take. The girlfriend's actions didn't provide that give and take, leading to his frustration.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's decision to break up might be seen as a last resort after her consistent inability to meet her financial obligations. However, the immediate action of kicking her out could be viewed as harsh. The balance between financial responsibility and relationship dynamics is tricky. It's possible that both sides contributed to the problem, but the key issue is whether the author's response was proportionate. Given the circumstances, the decision might be seen as justified, so the answer could be B (not in the wrong). But there's a possibility that the author could have handled it more gracefully, which might tip it towards A. However, given the girlfriend's lack of contribution and the author's financial stress, B might be the right choice.\n"
