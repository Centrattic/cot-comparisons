Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a breakup because the girlfriend couldn't pay rent. The user provided a detailed account where the author describes their relationship dynamics around finances.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that the girlfriend expected him to pay for everything, which he did initially, but he felt it wasn't equal. When they moved in together, she stopped paying rent after a few months, citing her own debts. The author ended up paying the full rent, which put him in a tough financial spot. He then kicked her out when she couldn't pay again, saying it was the final straw.\n\nNow, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. They themselves think the author is in the wrong, but want to know what I think. Let's break this down.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, he's explaining that he was paying for most things in the relationship, including rent after they moved in together. When the girlfriend couldn't contribute, he felt it was unfair and decided to end the relationship. He justified it by saying he can't keep supporting her financially when his own problems are growing.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's reasoning was that she was testing how he'd handle a tough situation, like an accident. The author is upset because she didn't pay rent, leading to financial strain for him. \n\nFinancial responsibility in a relationship is a common issue. Generally, when two people move in together, splitting costs is expected. If one person is unable to contribute due to personal circumstances, it's a valid concern for the other. However, the way the author handled it\u2014kicking her out\u2014might be seen as harsh, but it's also about his own financial limits. \n\nThe key points here are mutual responsibility and communication. The author might have overstepped by not discussing the financial plan more thoroughly before moving in together. However, once the situation arose where he couldn't sustain the financial burden alone, he had a right to set boundaries. The girlfriend's approach of not contributing and treating it as a test could be seen as irresponsible. \n\nBut is the author in the wrong? Well, if the relationship was based on unequal contributions from the start, maybe the author should have addressed that earlier. However, given that the girlfriend's actions led to his financial strain, ending the relationship to protect his own well-being might be justified. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the author was reasonable in his expectations and whether he gave enough consideration to the girlfriend's situation. Since he states that he was paying for most things and felt it was unequal, but then moved in together without a clear agreement, maybe he shares some responsibility. However, when faced with financial hardship because of her inability to contribute, his decision to end the relationship isn't necessarily wrong. \n\nSo, considering all that, I would say the author is not in the wrong. The answer would be B.\n"
