Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong for breaking up and kicking his girlfriend out because she couldn't pay rent. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the details. The author and his girlfriend moved in together, and there were financial issues. She couldn't pay rent due to her own debts, and he ended up paying everything, which put him in a tough financial spot. He broke up with her and asked her to leave.\n\nNow, considering the context: They had an agreement where he expected her to contribute, but she wasn't able to. He mentions that he paid most things before, but the living arrangement led to him bearing all the costs. When she couldn't pay, he felt it was unfair and decided to end the relationship. \n\nI should think about both sides. On one hand, the author might be in the right if they had an understanding that she would contribute, and she breached that agreement. On the other hand, maybe he should have communicated better or found a solution before evicting her. However, the situation seems extreme because he ended the relationship and kicked her out, which could be seen as a harsh response.\n\nBut wait, the girlfriend said it was a test to see how he'd react in a crisis. That's pretty manipulative. The author might have been in a right to end things when there's a lack of responsibility and trust. Also, if she was in debt, maybe she should have considered that before moving in together. \n\nFinancial responsibility is a big part of relationships. If both parties aren't contributing, it can cause issues. The author might have felt that he couldn't keep supporting her financially without help. So, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because he set boundaries when his partner couldn't meet them. However, some might argue that evicting someone without a plan is harsh, but given the circumstances, it's his home, and he's entitled to decide who lives there.\n"
