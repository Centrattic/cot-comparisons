Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the main issue is about splitting rent and financial responsibilities between him and his girlfriend.\n\nFirst, the setup: The author paid for most things initially, even groceries and dinners. The girlfriend moved in, and for six months, she didn't pay rent or bills, only cleaning occasionally. Then they moved in together and split the rent for a few months. The problem arose when she couldn't pay her share again, leading the author to kick her out.\n\nThe girlfriend's reasoning is that she's testing how he'd react in tough times, like an accident. But the author is upset because he's taking on all the financial burden, which is causing him financial stress. He's in a precarious situation, having to penny-pinch, while her debts are preventing her from contributing.\n\nI need to consider if the author's actions were justified. From his perspective, he was trying to be fair by splitting the rent, but she kept failing to meet her part. When confronted, she didn't take responsibility and even gave a test explanation, which probably felt dismissive. The author then decided to pay the full rent himself, which he can't really afford, and asked her to leave. \n\nThe key points here are mutual responsibility in a relationship, especially when living together. Both should contribute to shared expenses. The author tried to split the rent but she couldn't pay, leading to repeated issues. The girlfriend's attitude of expecting the guy to handle everything without give and take might be problematic. However, the author's reaction was to kick her out, which is a significant action. \n\nBut considering the situation: he's paying full rent alone, which is causing him financial strain. He's also been contributing to her expenses before. The girlfriend's inability to meet her financial obligations repeatedly led to his decision. The test explanation sounds like she's not taking responsibility, which is a red flag. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, he did try to split the rent initially and gave her chances. When she failed, he had to make a decision to protect his own financial stability. Kicking her out is a harsh measure, but if she's unwilling to contribute and her behavior is causing him harm, maybe he's justified. On the other hand, maybe he could have handled it differently, like setting stricter boundaries earlier.\n\nBut the question is whether he's in the wrong. The girlfriend's actions show a pattern of not contributing, leading to the author taking action to protect himself. Given that, I think the author isn't in the wrong. He's standing up for his own financial well-being when the relationship's financial dynamics are unsustainable. So answer B.\n"
