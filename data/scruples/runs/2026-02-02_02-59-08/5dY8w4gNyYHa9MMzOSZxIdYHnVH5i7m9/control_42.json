Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. So the situation is about a breakup because the girlfriend couldn't pay rent. Let me break down the details.\n\nThe user is a guy who's been in a relationship where he paid for most things, including rent after they moved in together. The girlfriend moved into his apartment in June 2018 and didn't pay rent for six months. They later moved in together and split rent initially. Then she couldn't pay, so he covered it. She tried to pay a few hundred later but didn't follow through. Eventually, she said she couldn't pay anything again, which led him to kick her out. She claims it was a test to see how he'd react in a tough situation.\n\nHmm. So the key points here are about financial responsibility in a relationship. The guy felt like he was carrying the financial burden, especially when they moved in together. The girlfriend didn't contribute to rent when she was supposed to, leading to the breakup. \n\nI need to consider if the guy overreacted. He paid for rent, groceries, events, etc., and she didn't reciprocate. When they moved in together, splitting rent is a common arrangement, and if one person isn't contributing, that can cause issues. The girlfriend's inability to pay due to her own debts might be a valid reason, but she didn't communicate clearly or take responsibility. The guy ended up shouldering all the financial strain, which can be a valid reason for breaking up. \n\nHowever, the girlfriend mentioned it was a test for an emergency. That seems like a bad excuse because it's not equivalent. Emergencies are unpredictable, but she knew her financial situation and didn't plan accordingly. The guy had to take the hit for her debts, which isn't fair. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the guy should have addressed the issue earlier instead of letting it build up. But given the timeline, he did try to communicate. When she couldn't pay, he covered it, but she wasn't forthcoming about her financial problems. \n\nSo, in terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The guy had a right to expect some contribution, especially after moving in together. His actions were a result of her not meeting her responsibilities. The girlfriend's test explanation is probably an excuse to justify her behavior. \n\nTherefore, the guy might not be in the wrong. He's protecting his financial stability, which is important. Relationships require mutual effort, and if one person is not contributing, it's reasonable to end it. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
