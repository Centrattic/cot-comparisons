Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a breakup because the girlfriend couldn't pay rent. The author is a guy who's been paying most of the expenses, and when they moved in together, she stopped contributing, leading him to kick her out.\n\nFirst, I need to look at both sides. The guy says he believed the guy should pay for most things, but there should be some give and take. He helped with dinners, events, groceries, etc., and she paid occasionally. When they moved in together, he expected some splitting of rent, but she stopped paying. He ended up paying full rent, which caused him financial strain. He got angry and kicked her out because she wouldn't contribute.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's side is that she couldn't pay due to her own debts and bills. After the breakup, she mentioned it was a test to see how he'd react in a tough situation, like an accident. The author thinks maybe he overreacted.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, financial responsibility in a relationship is a sensitive topic. If they were in a committed relationship and living together, splitting rent is typically expected unless otherwise agreed. The guy might have set an expectation that he'd pay more, but when the situation changed and he couldn't cover everything without help, the girlfriend not contributing could be a problem.\n\nBut was kicking her out the right move? The author's action was extreme. Instead of immediate eviction, maybe he could have communicated better, set boundaries, or sought a compromise. However, the girlfriend's refusal to contribute, even after being asked, might have left him with no choice. She tested him, which isn't fair, but she's in a tough spot financially. Still, living with someone and not contributing to shared expenses is a breach of trust.\n\nThe author's financial strain is valid. He had his own debts and couldn't afford to pay full rent alone. The girlfriend's attitude of expecting the guy to handle everything without reciprocity is problematic. The author's frustration is understandable, but the method of resolution\u2014kicking her out\u2014might be seen as harsh. However, given the circumstances, maybe it's justified because the relationship was unequal and unsustainable.\n\nIn summary, both parties have some fault. The author might have handled it more diplomatically, but the girlfriend's lack of contribution was a significant issue. The test comment from her shows a lack of consideration, which the author might have overreacted to, but the core issue of financial responsibility is a valid reason for breaking up. So, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
