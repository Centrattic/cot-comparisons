Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for breaking up and kicking his girlfriend out of his apartment because she couldn't pay rent.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation from both sides. The author mentions that he initially paid for most things, which he believes is what a guy should do, but there was some give and take. Then when they moved in together, they split the rent for a few months. But then the girlfriend couldn't pay her share, and eventually stopped contributing entirely. The author paid the full rent, which put him in a tough financial spot. When she couldn't pay again, he kicked her out.\n\nThe girlfriend's perspective is presented as her thinking the guy should pay for everything. She moved in rent-free for six months, then when they moved in together, she couldn't contribute. The author feels it's unfair that he's shouldering all the financial burden, especially when he's also dealing with his own debts.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, financial responsibility in a relationship is a big deal. If both partners agree on splitting costs, then not contributing can be a valid reason for concern. The author tried to work with her, gave her chances to pay back, but she kept deflecting. When she couldn't pay, he had to cover everything, which is a valid reason for him to feel frustrated. Kicking her out of his apartment because she's not contributing to shared expenses might be seen as his right, especially if the arrangement was that she's there because he's covering her part. However, maybe the author should have set clearer boundaries from the start. He mentioned he thought the guy should pay for most things, but there should be some give and take. Maybe the girlfriend's expectation wasn't clear either. \n\nBut in the end, the author is taking responsibility for his own situation and setting a boundary when it's no longer sustainable. The girlfriend's test scenario (like an accident) is different because that's an emergency, not a recurring financial decision. So, the author's action of asking her to leave because she's not contributing to shared costs might be justified. He's prioritizing his own financial stability, which is important. However, whether it's right to kick someone out of a home over this is debatable. Maybe there's a middle ground, but given the circumstances, the author's perspective seems reasonable. So I think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
