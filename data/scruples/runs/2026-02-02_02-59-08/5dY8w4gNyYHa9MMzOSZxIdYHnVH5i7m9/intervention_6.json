Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for breaking up and kicking their girlfriend out because she couldn't pay rent. \n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author mentions that he believed the guy should pay for most things but expects some give and take. They moved in together, split rent initially, but then the girlfriend couldn't pay. He ended up paying the full rent twice, which put him in a tough spot financially. When she couldn't pay again, he kicked her out. She later said it was a test to see how he'd react in a tough situation.\n\nSo, the main points here are about financial responsibilities in a relationship. The author feels he's been helping her financially, but when she couldn't contribute, he decided to end the relationship and the living arrangement. The girlfriend's reasoning about it being a test complicates things.\n\nI should consider whether the author's actions were justified. Financial responsibility is a common issue in relationships. If someone can't meet their part of the financial agreement, it's reasonable to expect that the living situation might change. However, the author's decision to kick her out might depend on the circumstances of their agreement when they moved in together.\n\nThe girlfriend's argument that she was testing his reaction is a red flag. If she was aware that her behavior would lead to financial strain but did it intentionally, that's problematic. However, if she was genuinely struggling with her own debts, that's a different scenario. The author might feel that her lack of contribution is unfair, especially if they had an agreement to split the rent.\n\nAnother angle is the communication aspect. Did they discuss financial expectations before moving in? If there was no clear agreement, it's possible that both parties have some responsibility. The author might have overstepped if he didn't address the issue through open communication first, but if he tried and she refused to pay, his actions could be seen as necessary.\n\nAlso, the girlfriend's comment about why she has a boyfriend if she's supposed to pay rent is a key point. It suggests she expected the author to cover her expenses, which might not be a sustainable or fair arrangement. The author prioritizing his own financial stability after being overburdened could be justified.\n\nIn summary, the author's decision to end the living arrangement and the relationship might be seen as justified if they had a mutual agreement to split costs and she consistently failed to meet her part. However, if there was no clear agreement and he assumed she'd contribute, it's possible he's in the wrong for not addressing it earlier. But considering the context and her testing behavior, the author's reaction might be reasonable.\n"
