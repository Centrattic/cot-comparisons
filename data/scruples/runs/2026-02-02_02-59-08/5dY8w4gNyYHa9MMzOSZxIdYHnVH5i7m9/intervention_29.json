Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if the author (the person in the AITA scenario) is in the wrong for breaking up and kicking their girlfriend out because she couldn't pay rent.\n\nFirst, looking at the situation: They were in a relationship where the guy covered most expenses, including rent after moving in together. The girlfriend didn't pay rent for a couple of months due to her own debts. The author paid the full rent, which caused him financial strain. When the situation continued, he kicked her out. She later claims it was a test to see how he'd react in tough times.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics here. The author believes that while men should pay for most things, there should be some reciprocity. The girlfriend isn't contributing financially, which creates an imbalance. The key points are financial responsibility in relationships and mutual support. \n\nIn many relationships, splitting costs like rent is expected, especially when living together. If one partner consistently can't contribute, it can strain the relationship. The author's frustration is understandable because he's shouldering all financial burdens, which isn't sustainable for him. \n\nThe girlfriend's actions\u2014staying with a friend for a week, not paying rent, and then justifying it as a test\u2014show a lack of consideration for the author's financial situation. Her attitude that the guy should pay for everything, including during tough times, seems to be a major issue here. \n\nThe author's decision to end the relationship when his financial situation was already strained might be seen as extreme. However, it's also about setting boundaries. He's making a choice that he can't afford to keep supporting her financially without reciprocation. \n\nWhether he's in the wrong depends on societal expectations. Some might argue that being in a relationship means supporting each other through tough times, even if it means financial sacrifice. Others might say that financial responsibility is crucial, and the girlfriend's lack of contribution was a red flag he should have addressed earlier. \n\nThe author's overreaction could be questioned, especially if he didn't communicate his financial limits before things escalated. But given that the girlfriend didn't take his concerns seriously and continued to rely on him, his decision to end things might be justified. \n\nIn conclusion, while there are arguments on both sides, the main issue is the imbalance in financial responsibility. The author's actions stem from his frustration with an unequal partnership. Whether he's in the wrong could depend on how much communication and prior agreements there were about financial matters. Since the girlfriend had prior knowledge of his financial strain and still didn't contribute, the author's decision might be seen as a necessary boundary, making him not in the wrong.\n"
