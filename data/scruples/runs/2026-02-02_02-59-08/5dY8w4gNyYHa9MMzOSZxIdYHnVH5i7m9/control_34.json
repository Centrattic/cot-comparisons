Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for breaking up and asking their girlfriend to leave because she couldn't pay rent. The situation is a bit complex, so I need to break it down.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that from the start, the girlfriend expected him to pay for most things, like dinners, events, trips, and groceries. She did pay for some things occasionally and cleaned the apartment sometimes, but he felt the contributions weren't equal. He's okay with the guy paying most of the time but wants some give and take.\n\nThen in June 2018, she moves in and for six months, she's not paying rent, bills, or groceries. He says she cleans but it's not even. Now, when they move in together, he expects to split the rent, which they do for a couple of months. But in February, she can't pay, so he covers the full rent. This puts him in a tough financial spot, but he manages to pay his own bills. Now, the next month she says she can't pay anything again, and when he asks about repayment, she says \"why do I have a boyfriend then?\" That's when he kicks her out.\n\nThe girlfriend later claims it was a test to see how he'd react in a tough situation, like if she got into an accident. The author is unsure if he overreacted.\n\nSo, to determine if he's in the wrong. Financial responsibility in a relationship is a key point here. Moving in together usually implies some form of shared financial commitment. If they had a verbal or implied agreement to split rent, then expecting her to contribute is reasonable. The girlfriend's inability to pay rent due to her debts and then not repaying him is a problem. The author might have a right to expect that, especially if it's affecting his financial stability. \n\nHowever, breaking up and kicking her out seems harsh. Communication might have been an issue. The author could have tried to negotiate or find a solution before taking such a step. Also, the girlfriend's reasoning about the test is questionable. A real emergency would require support, but financial irresponsibility isn't the same as needing help in a dire situation. \n\nBut the author's frustration is understandable. If he's consistently shouldering the financial burden without any reciprocity, it's a valid reason to reconsider the relationship. The key here is whether there was a clear agreement on financial responsibilities when they moved in together. If he was under the impression that it should be split and she didn't contribute, he might be justified. However, if he didn't set clear expectations from the start, he could be part of the problem.\n\nThe girlfriend's attitude of expecting the guy to cover everything without contribution is problematic. The author is taking a stand for his financial well-being, which is important. But the way he handled it\u2014kicking her out\u2014might be too extreme if there wasn't a prior agreement. Still, it's his apartment, and he's the one paying rent, so he has the right to set boundaries.\n\nIn summary, the author's actions are a response to financial irresponsibility from his partner, but the abruptness of the breakup and the lack of prior clear agreement might make his approach seem harsh. However, given the context of ongoing unequal contributions and the specific situation, he might not be entirely in the wrong. The answer likely depends on whether there was an agreement and if he gave her a chance to resolve the issue before taking drastic action.\n"
