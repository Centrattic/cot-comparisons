Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up and kicking his girlfriend out because she couldn't pay rent. Let me start by understanding the situation properly.\n\nThe author mentions that he and his girlfriend moved in together, and she expected him to pay most things. Even after moving in, she wasn't contributing equally. Then, when they moved in together in June 2018, she wasn't paying rent or bills. Later, she told him she couldn't afford to pay rent because of her debts. He ended up paying the full rent, which put him in a tough financial spot. Now, she can't pay again, and he kicks her out. She later says it was a test to see how he'd react in a crisis, but he thinks it's different.\n\nSo, the question is: is he in the wrong? Let's break it down. Financial responsibility in relationships is a big topic. Typically, when two people live together, splitting costs like rent and bills is expected. The author took over the rent payments when the girlfriend couldn't pay, which is understandable if they had an agreement, but it seems like there wasn't one. The girlfriend might have known she couldn't contribute, which could be a problem. However, the author's reaction of kicking her out might be harsh if they were in a committed relationship. On the other hand, if the girlfriend wasn't willing to contribute and the author couldn't afford it, maybe he had a right to end the relationship.\n\nBut wait, did the author communicate his expectations? The girlfriend thought the guy should pay most things, but the author expected some give and take. Maybe if they didn't set clear boundaries, both are at fault. The girlfriend's debt issues are her responsibility, but the author should have set clear terms about splitting expenses. Kicking someone out of an apartment can be a major decision. However, if the girlfriend wasn't contributing and the author was struggling financially, it's a valid reason to end the relationship. The girlfriend's comment about it being a test is concerning because intentionally putting someone in a tough spot isn't healthy. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author might not be in the wrong because he's making a call to protect his own financial well-being. But maybe he should have handled it differently, like discussing the situation more before taking action. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Since the girlfriend wasn't contributing and he made a choice to end the relationship, the answer might be B (No). But some might argue that kicking someone out of a shared home is extreme without proper communication. However, given the context that the girlfriend was unwilling to contribute and it was causing financial strain, the author's decision is understandable. So, the answer is likely B.\n"
