Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for breaking up and kicking their girlfriend out because she couldn't pay rent. \n\nFirst, the key points from the scenario: The woman moved into the author's apartment in 2018 and didn't pay rent for six months, only occasionally contributing. When they moved in together, they initially split the rent, but she later stopped paying due to her debts. The author paid the full rent, which strained their finances. After another month where she couldn't pay, the author kicked her out, leading to the breakup.\n\nNow, considering financial responsibility in relationships. It's common for couples to agree on splitting costs when living together. The author mentions that the woman expected the man to pay for most things, but there should be some give and take. However, in this case, the woman repeatedly failed to contribute her share, putting financial strain on the author. \n\nThe author's actions: After multiple instances of the woman not paying her share and not following through on promises to contribute, the author decided to end the relationship. The woman even framed her inability to pay as a test of the author's reaction to tough situations. \n\nEthically, the author is trying to protect their own financial stability. It's reasonable to expect mutual contributions in a shared living situation. The woman's lack of responsibility and reliance on the author's finances without reciprocation could be seen as unfair. The author's frustration is valid, especially when their own debts and bills are at stake. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that breaking up over financial issues is harsh. However, given the repeated failures to meet agreed-upon responsibilities and the woman's dismissive attitude (\"why do I have a boyfriend then?\"), the author's decision seems justified. The key point is whether the author acted within their rights to set boundaries regarding financial contributions in the relationship. \n\nGiven that the author tried to compromise initially and only took action after consistent non-payment, it's likely that the author is not in the wrong here. The woman's behavior was inconsiderate and irresponsible, leading to the author making a difficult but reasonable decision for their own well-being.\n"
