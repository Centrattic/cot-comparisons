Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for breaking up and kicking his girlfriend out because she couldn't pay rent.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the situation. The author mentions that he believed the guy should pay for most things, but there should be some give and take. The girlfriend moved in and initially didn't pay rent or bills. When they moved in together, they split the rent for a few months, but then she couldn't pay. The author had to cover the rent, which put him in a tough spot. Now she says she can't pay again, and he kicked her out. She claims it was a test to see how he'd react in a tough situation.\n\nSo, the main points are financial responsibilities in a relationship and communication. The author feels he's been carrying the financial burden, which is causing him stress. The girlfriend's inability to contribute due to her own debts is a problem. The author's reaction was to end the relationship and ask her to leave because he can't afford to cover everything.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, relationships do require mutual support, but there's a balance. If one person is consistently in a position where they can't contribute and the other is shouldering everything, it's understandable to reassess. However, kicking someone out of an apartment can be seen as extreme, especially if there's no alternative housing for them. But in this case, the author is in a financial bind, and the girlfriend isn't helping. The girlfriend's attitude of expecting the guy to handle everything without reciprocity is problematic. The author's decision to end the relationship when there's no give and take might be justified. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe he could have handled it differently, like having a discussion about financial expectations earlier or setting boundaries. But the situation escalated, and the final straw was her inability to pay again. The test she mentioned is a red flag, as manipulating the situation to see how he'd react isn't healthy. \n\nConsidering all that, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The girlfriend's behavior and lack of responsibility are significant factors. The author had to prioritize his own financial stability, especially if the relationship wasn't balanced. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
