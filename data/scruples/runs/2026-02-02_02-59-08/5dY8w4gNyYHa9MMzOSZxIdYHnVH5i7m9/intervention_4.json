Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The author broke up with their girlfriend and kicked her out of the apartment because she couldn't pay rent. They mentioned that the relationship had financial imbalances before she moved in, and after moving in, she stopped contributing to rent, which led to the author paying everything.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the financial responsibilities in a relationship. The author believed the guy should pay for most things but expects some give and take. The girlfriend, on the other hand, seems to have expected the author to cover everything without reciprocating much. When they moved in together, splitting the rent was agreed upon, but she stopped contributing. The author then paid the full rent, which caused financial strain, and when the girlfriend couldn't pay again, the author kicked her out.\n\nNow, the key points to evaluate: Did the author have a right to expect her to contribute to rent? In a shared living situation, splitting costs is common unless otherwise agreed. The author mentions that they did split the rent for a couple of months, indicating an initial agreement. If the girlfriend stopped contributing without a valid reason, the author might be justified in asking her to leave. However, the author's actions of kicking her out might be harsh if there were no prior agreements or discussions about financial responsibilities.\n\nThe girlfriend's reasoning about testing the author's reaction in an emergency is questionable. Using a financial crisis as a test could be seen as manipulative. However, the author's response of immediately evicting her without trying to find a solution (like a payment plan or discussing her financial situation) might be seen as overreacting. \n\nFinancial stress can strain relationships, but communication is key. The author did try to discuss repayment, but the girlfriend didn't take it seriously. The author's decision to end the relationship might be understandable if the financial imbalance was causing significant stress. However, kicking someone out of their home is a serious action. It could be argued that the author should have given more time or sought mediation before taking that step.\n\nConsidering all this, the author might not be in the wrong if the financial contributions were part of the agreed terms. However, the abrupt eviction without a plan for her housing could be seen as harsh. On the other hand, the girlfriend's lack of responsibility in contributing to rent and treating the situation as a test might justify the author's actions. It's a bit of a gray area, but leaning towards the author not being in the wrong since the financial expectations were part of their living arrangement, and the girlfriend didn't meet her responsibilities.\n"
