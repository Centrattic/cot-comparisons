Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a breakup because the girlfriend couldn't pay rent. The author is claiming that they're not the bad guy here.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the details. The couple moved in together, and initially, the guy was paying most things, including rent when she moved in. Then when they moved in together, they split the rent for a while. But then the girlfriend couldn't pay, and the guy had to cover it. He got frustrated because she wasn't contributing her share, especially when he was already in a financial bind. He kicked her out, and she later said it was a test to see his reaction.\n\nSo, the main points here are financial responsibility, communication issues, and differing expectations in a relationship. The guy believes he's just standing up for himself financially, while the girlfriend might have had different expectations. \n\nNow, considering relationship norms, it's common for couples to split expenses, especially when living together. If one partner consistently fails to contribute, it can cause tension. The guy's frustration is understandable, especially if he's taking on a disproportionate financial burden. However, how he handled the situation is key. Kicking someone out of the apartment abruptly might be seen as harsh, but if the living arrangement was under his name, he might have the right to do that. \n\nThe girlfriend's attitude of expecting the guy to pay everything and treating her inability to pay as a test is problematic. That seems like a lack of responsibility and consideration for his financial situation. However, the guy's reaction might have been abrupt without giving her a chance to resolve her debts or come up with another agreement. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the guy is protecting his own financial stability, which is important. But relationships require compromise, and maybe he should have addressed the issue earlier instead of waiting until the lease was up. However, given the circumstances where she's not contributing at all and even using it as a test, his decision might be justified.\n\nI think the answer is B (No, he's not in the wrong). The girlfriend's behavior was inconsiderate, and he had a right to set boundaries after repeated failures to contribute. However, the way he handled it (kicking her out) might be seen as harsh, but considering the context, it's understandable. The key point is that both parties have responsibilities in a relationship, and she wasn't fulfilling hers, leading to his justified decision.\n"
