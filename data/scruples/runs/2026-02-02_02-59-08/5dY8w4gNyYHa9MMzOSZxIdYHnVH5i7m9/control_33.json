Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who broke up with their girlfriend because she couldn't pay rent is in the wrong. The situation involves financial disagreements, especially around splitting rent and other expenses.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that he was the one paying most of the expenses, even when they were dating. He thought the guy should pay for most things but expected some give and take. Then when they moved in together, she stopped paying her share, leading to him paying full rent and eventually kicking her out.\n\nSo, the key points are: the woman wasn't contributing her share to rent, which the author found unfair. He had to cover her share, which put him in a tough financial spot. The woman's reasoning for not paying was her debts and that she thought the boyfriend should handle it. She even said it was a test to see how he'd react in a crisis.\n\nNow, considering societal norms, many might argue that both partners should contribute to shared expenses when living together. If one partner isn't contributing, it can lead to financial strain. The author made the decision to end the relationship when the financial imbalance became unsustainable. The woman's attitude of expecting the partner to cover everything might be seen as unreasonable, especially after they moved in together. \n\nHowever, some might say that the author could have addressed the issue earlier or found a compromise before it escalated. But given that she wasn't paying anything for six months and then continued to refuse, it seems like he had no choice but to act. The fact that she considered it a \"test\" of his financial responsibility might be seen as manipulative or not taking the relationship seriously.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's subjective. But from a fairness and financial responsibility standpoint, the author's actions seem justified. He's prioritizing his own financial stability and setting boundaries. The woman's behavior likely contributed to the breakup. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
