Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about a breakup where the author kicked his girlfriend out because she couldn't pay rent. The question is whether he's at fault here.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The couple moved in together, split rent initially, but she stopped paying after a while. He ends up paying all the rent, which strains his finances. Then she says she can't pay again, and he kicks her out. She claims she was testing his reaction for a possible emergency. He's wondering if he overreacted.\n\nThe user's own thought is that the author is in the wrong, but they want to know my opinion. I need to analyze both sides. \n\nFrom the author's perspective, he's in a financial bind. He expected some shared responsibility, especially since they live together. When she can't pay, he's left with full responsibility, which he can't manage comfortably. His decision to ask her to leave seems like an attempt to regain control of his finances. Maybe he felt it was unfair to carry the entire burden, especially after she indicated she wouldn't help even when she could.\n\nOn the other side, the girlfriend might be in a difficult financial situation herself. If she's dealing with debts, maybe she's struggling. Her testing his reaction by not paying could be seen as selfish, but maybe she had no choice. However, using the relationship as a financial crutch without contributing is problematic.\n\nThe main question is about fairness and mutual responsibility. In a shared living situation, both parties should contribute to expenses. If one person is consistently not contributing, it's reasonable for the other to reconsider the arrangement. The author's frustration is understandable. He tried to split the rent, but she failed to meet her part. When she couldn't pay, he was left in a worse position. His response of asking her to leave might be harsh, but it's a realistic way to address the imbalance.\n\nHowever, the way he handled it\u2014kicking her out immediately after she couldn't pay\u2014might lack communication or alternatives. Maybe there were other solutions, like adjusting the split if she couldn't pay at the moment, or seeking financial counseling. But given that she had previously not paid much and then refused to pay even a few hundred, his patience might have run out.\n\nThe girlfriend's justification about testing his reaction is concerning. Using the relationship as a test for hypothetical emergencies is manipulative. It shows a lack of consideration for his financial well-being. Her expecting him to cover her expenses without any reciprocity isn't fair.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author isn't wrong to prioritize his own financial stability. Relationships should involve mutual support, but not at the expense of one person's well-being. If she was in financial trouble, they should have discussed it openly and found a solution together. Instead, she seems to have shifted the burden entirely onto him, which is unreasonable.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author's decision, while perhaps harsh, is a reaction to his partner's failure to meet basic responsibilities in the shared living arrangement. He's not in the wrong because he's protecting his own financial situation after repeated failures from her side. The girlfriend's behavior is more at fault here. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
