Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for breaking up with their girlfriend because she couldn't pay rent. Hmm. Let me go through the details carefully.\n\nFirst, the situation: The couple moved in together, and initially split the rent. Then the girlfriend couldn't pay, so the guy paid the full rent while she stayed with a friend for a week. He mentions that he's in a tough financial spot. Then again, she can't pay this month either, and she says \"why do I have a boyfriend then?\" which makes him kick her out. She later says it was a test to see how he'd react in a tough situation, like an accident.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let me think about the key points.\n\n1. Financial Responsibility in Relationships: When two people live together, especially a couple, sharing expenses is common. If one person can't contribute, it's a problem. The author was paying for most things even before moving in together. After moving in, splitting rent logically makes sense. But when she couldn't pay, he took it on, which put him in a financial bind. \n\n2. Expectations and Communication: The author mentions he had a mindset where the guy pays for most things, but there should be some give and take. The girlfriend seems to have expected the guy to handle all the expenses, but then when he's in a tight spot, she's not contributing. There might be a communication breakdown here. Did they set clear expectations about financial contributions from the start?\n\n3. The Breaking Point: When she says she can't pay and he kicks her out, that's a major decision. The user might argue that he's standing up for his own financial health, but others might think that breaking up over this is too harsh. However, if it's a shared apartment and she's not contributing, it's reasonable for him to ask her to leave if he can't afford to keep covering her share.\n\n4. Her Reasoning: She says it was a test to see how he'd react in her hypothetical emergency. This is concerning because using someone's financial stress as a test is inconsiderate. But maybe he overreacted? Or was she being manipulative?\n\n5. Legal and Practical Aspects: If the apartment is in his name, he's legally responsible for the rent. She moving in without contributing could lead to financial strain. He's not obligated to support her financially if they're not married. Legally, he can ask her to leave if she's not paying her share, especially if it's a lease in his name.\n\n6. Emotional vs. Financial: The user might feel wronged if he's sacrificing his own financial stability for her. But others might say that relationships require compromise, and if she's not contributing, it's a red flag. However, kicking someone out can be seen as harsh, but if they're not in a committed partnership where financial support is expected, it's his right to protect his own resources.\n\n7. Cultural and Gender Norms: The user mentions he believes the guy should pay for most things but there should be give and take. The girlfriend's expectation that the guy should pay everything might be an issue. However, when they moved in together, splitting responsibilities is normal, so expecting her to contribute is reasonable.\n\nPutting it all together: The author had a financial arrangement that wasn't working. The girlfriend's refusal to pay her share, despite his financial struggles, led to him making a tough decision. While breaking up might seem harsh, he's prioritizing his own financial health. However, whether he's in the wrong depends on the context of their relationship and agreements. If they were in a partnership, maybe he should have handled it differently. But if the apartment is his and she's a tenant, his actions are justified. The girlfriend's test as a reason is problematic. So, likely the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
