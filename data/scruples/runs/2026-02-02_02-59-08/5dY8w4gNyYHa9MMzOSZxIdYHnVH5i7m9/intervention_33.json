Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe user is asking if the person who wrote this is wrong for breaking up and kicking their girlfriend out because she couldn't pay rent. The author explains that their girlfriend moved in six months ago and didn't pay rent, bills, or groceries, even though she sometimes paid for things like cleaning. Then they moved in together and split the rent for a while, but she stopped contributing. The author is now paying full rent alone, which is causing financial strain, and he kicked her out. The girlfriend claims it was a test to see how he'd handle tough situations, like an accident. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants opinions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the expectations in a relationship regarding financial responsibilities. The author mentions that he believes the guy should pay for most things but there should be give and take. However, in a shared living situation, it's generally expected that both roommates contribute to rent and bills, regardless of relationship status. If they moved in together, it's reasonable to split the costs. The girlfriend not contributing financially after being asked could be seen as a breach of that agreement.\n\nHowever, the author also admits that he let her live rent-free for six months before they moved in together. That might have set a precedent where the girlfriend didn't expect to pay rent. Now, when the author expects her to contribute, she's struggling financially. The girlfriend's reasoning that the boyfriend should support her financially might be based on their past behavior, not necessarily on what's fair. \n\nThe author's decision to kick her out because she couldn't pay rent raises questions. If the lease was in his name, he might have the right to ask her to leave if she's not contributing. But if they were in a romantic relationship, maybe there's an expectation of support. However, the girlfriend's claim that this was a test to see how he'd handle her financial issues seems problematic. It's not fair to use someone else's financial struggles as a test. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is now in a worse financial situation because he's paying full rent alone. His frustration is understandable. But kicking someone out of the apartment because they can't pay their share might be harsh, especially if they were in a relationship. However, if there was an agreement to split rent and she's not holding up her end, the author has a right to enforce that. \n\nI need to consider cultural norms. In some cultures, it's expected that the guy pays for everything in a relationship, but that's changing. If the couple was sharing an apartment as roommates, splitting costs is standard. The girlfriend's behavior of not contributing and expecting the author to cover everything might be the real issue here. \n\nThe girlfriend's justification that it was a test doesn't seem valid. Financial responsibility is a two-way street. If she couldn't pay, maybe she should have left earlier instead of expecting the author to take full responsibility. The author's overreaction might be breaking up with her, but if she was never contributing and it's causing him financial harm, maybe his decision is justified. \n\nIn summary, the author's actions might be seen as justified if there was an agreement to split costs and she wasn't contributing. However, the way he kicked her out could be seen as harsh. Alternatively, her expecting him to cover everything without contribution is also problematic. The key points are whether there was an agreement, the expectations of both parties, and the fairness of the situation. Given that, the author might not be in the wrong if he had a valid agreement and she violated it. However, the abrupt nature of the breakup and the financial strain could also be seen as a harsh response. But considering the girlfriend's lack of contribution and her testing behavior, the author's decision might be seen as reasonable.\n"
