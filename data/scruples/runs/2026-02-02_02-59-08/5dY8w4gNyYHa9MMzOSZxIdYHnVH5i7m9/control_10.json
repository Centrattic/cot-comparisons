Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking whether the person who broke up with their girlfriend and kicked her out for not paying rent is in the wrong. The story says the couple moved in together, split rent initially, but the girlfriend couldn't pay her share. The author ended up covering all the rent, which strained his finances. When she couldn't pay again, he kicked her out.\n\nFirst, I need to consider financial responsibilities in a relationship. The author mentions he believed the guy should pay most things but expected some give and take. However, when they moved in together, he expected her to split the rent. She couldn't, so he ended up covering it, which led to his financial stress. He then decided she needed to contribute, but she didn't, leading to the breakup.\n\nThe key points here are mutual responsibility and communication. When two people live together, splitting costs is typically expected unless there's an agreement otherwise. The girlfriend's inability to pay her share created an imbalance. The author tried to compromise, but she wasn't meeting her part, which caused financial strain. \n\nHe might have overreacted by kicking her out immediately, but considering the ongoing issues and her lack of contribution, it's a point of contention. However, the girlfriend's defense that it was a \"test\" to see his reaction in a crisis is questionable. If she knew she couldn't pay, she should have communicated that upfront and perhaps found another solution.\n\nThe author's actions were driven by frustration and financial pressure. While there's a case that he should have addressed the issue earlier and perhaps found a middle ground, his decision to end the relationship because of financial mismanagement is understandable. The girlfriend's behavior\u2014relying on him without contributing\u2014also plays a role in the conflict.\n\nIn conclusion, while there might be some room for argument about how the situation was handled, the author's actions stem from justified concerns about unequal financial responsibility. The girlfriend's lack of contribution and her dismissive attitude towards paying rent are significant factors. Therefore, the author isn't entirely in the wrong.\n"
