Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up and kicking out his girlfriend because she couldn't pay rent. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author mentions that his girlfriend moved in with him, and initially, he paid for most things, including rent for six months. Then they moved in together and split the rent, but she stopped paying her share. He paid the full rent, which put him in a tough financial spot. When she couldn't pay again, he kicked her out.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides. The key points here are financial responsibility in a relationship. The author states that he believes the guy should pay for most things, but there needs to be some give and take. However, his girlfriend wasn't contributing her share, leading to financial strain on him. \n\nOn one hand, expecting a partner to pay their share of rent when living together is reasonable. If someone is living in a place they contribute to the costs. The author might have set expectations early on that weren't met. The girlfriend's attitude of expecting the guy to pay everything might be problematic. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might have enabled this by not setting clear boundaries earlier. He mentions that he went along with paying for most things against his better judgment. Maybe he should have addressed the imbalance sooner. However, the situation escalated when she stopped paying rent entirely, which is a significant financial burden. \n\nThe girlfriend's reasoning that the author should support her through her financial issues because she's his girlfriend seems unfair. Financial responsibility in a relationship should be mutual. If one partner is consistently unable to contribute, it's a valid concern. The author made a difficult decision to end the relationship to protect his own financial stability. \n\nThe user might think the author overreacted, but considering the financial strain and the girlfriend's lack of contribution, the author's actions could be justified. The girlfriend's test scenario doesn't hold weight because the situation isn't the same as an emergency; she's choosing to not pay her share. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author wasn't in the wrong for setting boundaries and taking action when those boundaries were repeatedly crossed. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
