Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up and kicking their girlfriend out of his apartment because she couldn't pay rent. The question is whether the author is at fault here.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend moved in and initially didn't pay rent, which the author mentions was against their better judgment. The author paid for most things, but the girlfriend contributed occasionally. Then, when they moved in together, they agreed to split the rent. However, the girlfriend couldn't pay, leading the author to pay the full rent, which put him in a financial bind. The breaking point was when she refused to pay again, and the author kicked her out. The girlfriend later claims it was a test to see how he'd handle a tough situation.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know my opinion. The options are A (Yes, author is wrong) or B (No, not wrong).\n\nI need to evaluate the situation from both sides. The author's perspective is that they were supporting the relationship financially, expecting some contribution, and when that didn't happen, they felt it was unfair. The girlfriend's side is that she couldn't pay due to her own debts and maybe tested the author's commitment.\n\nFinancial responsibility in relationships is a common issue. In many relationships, partners expect some level of shared financial responsibility, but circumstances like debt can affect that. However, assuming the author had a prior agreement about splitting expenses, the girlfriend not contributing when able might be a problem. However, the author's reaction\u2014kicking her out\u2014might be seen as extreme, especially if the girlfriend was in a financial hardship.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of mutual agreements. If they agreed to split rent and she couldn't pay, perhaps the author should have had a conversation earlier rather than waiting until it became a crisis. The girlfriend's test explanation is a bit concerning, as it suggests she might have known she couldn't pay but still moved in.\n\nThe key points are: prior support, lack of equal contribution, and the sudden financial burden. The author's decision to end the relationship and remove her might be seen as justified if they felt they were sacrificing too much. However, the manner of kicking her out (emotionally and financially) could be harsh. On the other hand, if the author had a clear agreement and the girlfriend violated it, the author isn't necessarily wrong.\n\nIn many relationships, financial expectations should be discussed early. The author might have been in denial about the imbalance. The breaking point was when the girlfriend refused to contribute despite knowing the author's financial strain. The test justification is a red flag, indicating manipulative behavior. \n\nConsidering all this, the author's actions might be seen as a justified response to a partner who wasn't meeting their financial obligations, especially if there was an agreement. However, the way it was handled could be problematic. But overall, the author might not be in the wrong if there was an expectation of shared financial responsibility that wasn't met.\n"
