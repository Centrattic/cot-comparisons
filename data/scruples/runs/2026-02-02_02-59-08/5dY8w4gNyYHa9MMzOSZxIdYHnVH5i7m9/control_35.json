Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story (AITA) is in the wrong for breaking up and kicking their girlfriend out because she couldn't pay rent. The situation involves financial responsibilities in a relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The writer mentions that the girlfriend expected him to pay for most things, which he did. When they moved in together, they initially split the rent, but she couldn't pay her share due to her debts. The writer ends up paying full rent, which puts his own finances at risk. The girlfriend seems to believe that the boyfriend's role is to cover her expenses, leading to the breakup.\n\nFinancial expectations in relationships can vary, but generally, splitting costs is common when living together. The writer's frustration stems from the imbalance, especially since he's shouldering all the financial burden. The girlfriend moving out temporarily and then returning without contributing might have exacerbated the situation. \n\nThe key points are mutual responsibility and agreement on financial contributions. If they had a prior agreement to split rent, her inability to pay would be a problem, but maybe communication was lacking. However, the writer's decision to ask her to leave might be seen as extreme, but considering the financial strain and her repeated inability to contribute, it's understandable. \n\nThe girlfriend's comment about it being a \"test\" suggests she may not take responsibility, which could justify the writer's actions. However, some might argue that the solution was to address the issue through communication, not eviction. But given the repeated failures and the financial impact, the writer's actions might be seen as justified. \n\nSo, the answer would likely be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong because he had a valid reason based on financial responsibilities and prior expectations.\n"
