Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking whether the author did the wrong thing by breaking up and kicking his girlfriend out because she couldn't pay rent. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants another opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author and his girlfriend moved in together, and initially split the rent. Then she couldn't pay, and he ended up paying all, which put him in a tough spot financially. When he asked her to pay back or help, she said no, leading him to kick her out. She later mentioned it was a test to see his reaction.\n\nNow, to assess who's in the wrong. The key factors here are communication, expectations, and fairness. The author mentions that he believed the guy should pay most, but there should be some give and take. However, the girlfriend didn't contribute equally in terms of rent, even after moving in together. When she couldn't pay, he covered it, but she didn't reciprocate when he needed help. \n\nFrom the author's perspective, he set boundaries but they weren't respected. The girlfriend's actions might stem from different expectations about financial responsibilities. However, expecting the partner to cover all expenses without contribution can be seen as unfair. The author had to make a tough decision to protect his finances, which could be justified if there was a mutual agreement on splitting costs. \n\nOn the other hand, breaking up and kicking someone out over unpaid rent might seem harsh. But if there was a prior understanding that she would contribute, then his action could be justified. The girlfriend's comment about it being a test complicates things, suggesting she might have known the financial strain he was under but used it as a test. That could indicate poor communication or manipulation.\n\nConsidering all this, the author might not be in the wrong because he tried to compromise, but the girlfriend didn't meet her part. However, the decision to end the relationship over unpaid rent could be seen as extreme. But given the context, maybe it's reasonable. The main issue is whether there was a clear agreement on financial responsibilities from the start. If not, both might share some blame. But since the author tried to split the rent and she didn't contribute, his actions could be seen as necessary self-preservation.\n"
