Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the story is in the wrong for breaking up and kicking their girlfriend out because she couldn't pay rent. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the couple moved in together, split rent initially. Then the girlfriend couldn't pay her share, and the author ended up covering it. The girlfriend's reasoning was that since she's with a boyfriend, he should handle the rent. The author felt it was unfair, especially since they had financial issues themselves. The girlfriend also mentioned it was a test to see how he'd react in tough times, but the author saw it as a different scenario.\n\nThe user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong, but they want a different perspective. I need to analyze both sides. From the author's viewpoint, they were contributing financially but felt it was unequal. The girlfriend wasn't contributing her share, leading to financial strain. The author made a decision to protect their own finances, which is understandable. However, kicking someone out of an apartment can be harsh. But considering the context\u2014financial responsibility and the girlfriend's attitude\u2014it might be justified. The girlfriend's approach of expecting the partner to cover everything, even when the author was struggling, seems problematic. The author acted to prevent further financial issues, which is a valid reason. So, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
