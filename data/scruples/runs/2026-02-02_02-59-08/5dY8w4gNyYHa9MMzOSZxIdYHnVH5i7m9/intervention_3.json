Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up and kicking their girlfriend out of the apartment because she couldn't pay rent.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the situation from both sides. The author mentions that the girlfriend couldn't pay rent due to her own debts and bills. He says he was paying for most things already, and when they moved in together, she stopped contributing. He paid the full rent, which put him in a tough financial spot. When she couldn't pay again, he asked her to move out. She later claimed it was a test to see how he'd react in a crisis, which he found different from her actual situation.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. But I need to consider relationship norms and expectations. Typically, in a relationship, especially when living together, splitting costs like rent is common. However, the girlfriend's actions\u2014stating she can't pay and not contributing\u2014might be seen as a breach of trust or agreement. The author felt it was unfair to bear all the financial burden while his own debts were piling up. Kicking her out could be seen as a decision to protect his own financial stability.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of communication. The author had discussions with her, and she didn't commit to a repayment plan. The girlfriend's response that it was a test might indicate a lack of consideration for the author's feelings and financial situation. However, some might argue that the author could have handled it more compassionately, perhaps by discussing alternatives or giving her more time.\n\nLegally, if the apartment is in his name, he might have the right to ask her to leave. Emotionally, though, relationships require mutual support. If the author's actions were driven by frustration rather than a fair solution, that could be problematic. However, given the financial strain and repeated issues, his decision might be seen as necessary for his well-being.\n\nIn summary, while the girlfriend's inability to pay rent is a problem, the author's response of asking her to leave might be justified if they had agreed to split costs and she consistently failed to contribute. The key is whether there was an agreement and mutual understanding. If the author took on the responsibility without a clear agreement and then had to adjust when she couldn't pay, that's a different scenario. But since the situation had been ongoing and discussions didn't resolve it, the author might not be in the wrong.\n"
