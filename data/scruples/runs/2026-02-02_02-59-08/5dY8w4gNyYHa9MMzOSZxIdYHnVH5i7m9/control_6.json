Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is a guy who had a girlfriend who moved into his apartment. He mentions that she expected him to pay for most things, and even when they moved in together, she couldn't pay her share of the rent. She ended up not contributing, and he ended up paying all the bills, which put him in a financial bind. When he confronted her, she said it was a test to see how he'd react in a tough situation. He kicked her out because he felt she wasn't helping and was relying on him entirely. Now he's asking if he was in the wrong.\n\nFirst, let's consider the financial responsibilities in a relationship. It's common for couples to split expenses when living together, but expectations can vary. The author mentions that he believed the guy should pay for most things, but there should be some give and take. However, in this case, the girlfriend wasn't contributing anything once the financial pressure came. She said she couldn't pay her share, and even when she could pay a few hundred, she didn't follow through. The author ended up covering everything, which caused him financial strain.\n\nThe key points here are mutual responsibility and communication. The author might have thought that since he was paying for most things before, it was okay when she moved in. But when the financial burden became unmanageable, he had to act. The girlfriend's response that it was a test suggests she might have been testing his commitment, which is problematic because it's not a fair or realistic scenario. Accidents or emergencies are different from a partner intentionally not contributing to shared expenses.\n\nThe author's reaction was to kick her out, which is a significant step. However, considering his financial stress and the lack of contribution from his partner, it's understandable that he felt he had no choice. He did warn her and tried to discuss repayment, but she didn't take it seriously. The girlfriend's mindset of expecting the guy to pay everything without balancing the effort might be the real issue here.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that ending a relationship over financial issues could be harsh if there was a willingness to work things out. But the author tried to communicate and set boundaries, and when those weren't respected, he made a decision to protect his own financial stability.\n\nSo, weighing both sides, the author's actions were a response to his partner's lack of responsibility in shared living costs. While it's a tough call, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because he communicated his concerns and took action when those concerns weren't addressed. The girlfriend's behavior seems to be the root of the problem here.\n"
