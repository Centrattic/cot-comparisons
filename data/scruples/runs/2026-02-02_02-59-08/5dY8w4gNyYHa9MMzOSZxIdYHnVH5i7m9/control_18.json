Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for breaking up and kicking his girlfriend out because she couldn't pay rent. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple moved in together, and initially, they split the rent. The girlfriend then couldn't pay her share, leading the author to pay full rent himself. He's upset because he's taking on financial responsibility while hers are piling up. She seems to expect him to cover her expenses, even when it's hard for him.\n\nThe key points here are financial responsibility in a relationship. The author mentions that he believed the guy should pay for most things but there should be give and take. However, when it comes to rent, splitting it is standard, especially when living together. The girlfriend's inability to contribute led to the author paying more than his fair share, causing him financial strain.\n\nThe girlfriend's reasoning for not contributing is her own debts and bills, but that doesn't absolve her responsibility to contribute to shared living expenses. The author's frustration is understandable because he's taking financial hits while she isn't helping. The final straw was her expecting him to cover rent without reciprocity, leading to the breakup.\n\nNow, considering relationship expectations. If both were aware they would split responsibilities, then not fulfilling that part is a breach of trust. The author made it clear he needed help with rent, but she couldn't. The girlfriend's test scenario doesn't justify her actions because real-life situations require mutual support, not just hypotheticals.\n\nFinancial dependence in a relationship can be tricky. While some people expect the guy to pay more, there's a line when it becomes unsustainable. The author's decision to end the relationship because of this financial imbalance might be seen as justified since it's a fundamental disagreement about shared responsibilities.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? He took action when his partner couldn't meet agreed-upon responsibilities, leading to a breakup. Since he tried to resolve it by asking for payment and she refused, his actions might be seen as self-preservation rather than being wrong. Therefore, the answer is B (No, he's not in the wrong).\n"
