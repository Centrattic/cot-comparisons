Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe author dated a girlfriend and they moved in together. The main issue is about financial responsibilities, especially rent. The author mentions that he paid for most things, including rent initially, and his girlfriend wasn't contributing equally. After moving in together, she couldn't pay rent due to her debts, so he paid the full amount. Now, she's not paying anything, and he kicked her out because he couldn't handle the financial strain anymore. She later said it was a test to see how he'd react in a tough situation.\n\nSo, the key points are: unequal financial contributions leading up to the breakup, the girlfriend's refusal to pay rent, and the author's decision to end the relationship and ask her to leave the apartment. \n\nThe user's question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider both sides.\n\nFrom the author's perspective: He's taking responsibility for his part by acknowledging he may have paid more than he should, but he's now in a financial crisis because he's covering all the costs. He had to make a decision to protect his own financial stability, which is understandable. Relationships require mutual effort, and if one person isn't contributing, especially in a shared living situation, it can be a deal-breaker. The girlfriend's attitude of expecting the guy to pay everything might be a red flag. Also, her justification that it was a test for an emergency seems invalid because emergencies are different from chronic financial irresponsibility.\n\nFrom the girlfriend's perspective: She's struggling with her own debts and bills, which is a real issue. Maybe she's in a vulnerable position and didn't have the means to contribute. However, in a relationship where both are living together, sharing financial responsibilities is usually expected. Her lack of communication and willingness to pay back the author isn't fair. Testing how her partner would handle a crisis by lying or not contributing is also problematic.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's a bit subjective. Financial stress is a common relationship issue. The author had to make a tough choice, and while it's harsh to kick someone out, he's taking steps to protect his own financial well-being. The girlfriend's behavior shows a lack of responsibility and consideration. The author's actions, while drastic, might be justified given the circumstances. However, some might argue that he should have addressed the issue sooner or found a compromise.\n\nBut the user thinks the author is in the wrong. Why? Maybe because breaking up and kicking someone out is seen as harsh. However, the author's financial situation is dire, and the girlfriend's lack of contribution is a significant problem. The key is mutual contribution in a relationship. If one person isn't pulling their weight, especially in shared living costs, it's reasonable for the other to reassess the relationship. The author's decision, while difficult, might be necessary for his own well-being.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B (No).\n"
