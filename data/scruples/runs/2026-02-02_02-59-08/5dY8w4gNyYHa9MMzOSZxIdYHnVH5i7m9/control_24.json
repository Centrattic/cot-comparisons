Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who broke up with their girlfriend because she couldn't pay rent is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The author mentions that they moved in together and initially split the rent. Then the girlfriend couldn't pay, so the author paid the full rent. The girlfriend's reasoning was that since she's his girlfriend, he should take care of her, which seems like an unequal dynamic from the start. The final straw was when she said not paying rent was a test to see how he'd react, which the author found unacceptable.\n\nThe key points here are financial responsibility in a relationship. The author feels that while he's okay with paying most of the expenses, there should be some reciprocity. The girlfriend, on the other hand, seems to have expected the author to cover everything, which led to imbalance. The author's decision to kick her out after she couldn't contribute financially is controversial. \n\nBut wait, in a healthy relationship, both partners should contribute to shared expenses. If one partner is consistently not contributing, it's a valid reason for concern. However, the author's approach might be too harsh. Maybe there's a middle ground, like a discussion about financial plans or support during her debt, but the author's reaction was to end the relationship immediately. \n\nThe girlfriend's attitude of expecting the guy to pay for everything is problematic. The author tried to accommodate her in the past, but when it came to the rent, he couldn't keep covering for her. The test explanation from the girlfriend doesn't excuse her behavior. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author had valid reasons to feel wronged by the unequal sharing of financial responsibility. While it's important to approach such situations with empathy and communication, the author's reaction, while extreme, might be justified given the lack of reciprocity. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Since the girlfriend's behavior was exploitative and the author stood up for his own financial needs, maybe he's not in the wrong. But maybe there's a better way to handle it. Hmm.\n\nI think the author made a tough choice but wasn't necessarily in the wrong. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
