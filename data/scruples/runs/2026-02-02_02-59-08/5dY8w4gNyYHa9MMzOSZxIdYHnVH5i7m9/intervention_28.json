Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up and evicting his girlfriend because she couldn't pay rent. The situation seems complex, so I need to look at both sides.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that he believed the guy should pay for most things, but there should be give and take. The girlfriend moved in and for six months didn't pay rent or bills. Then, when they moved in together, she couldn't pay her share. The author ends up paying the full rent, which puts him in a tough financial spot. The girlfriend seems to expect the author to cover everything, even when she can't contribute. The final straw was her saying \"why do I have a boyfriend then\" when he asked for help.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants a second opinion. I need to consider the financial responsibilities in a partnership. While it's common for couples to have different views on money, the author clearly felt the financial imbalance was unsustainable. The girlfriend's lack of contribution led to financial strain on him. Evicting her might be seen as extreme, but if they were living together, splitting rent is standard. The girlfriend's attitude of expecting the partner to cover all expenses without reciprocation is problematic. The author's decision to end the relationship might be his way of protecting his financial stability, especially since he's already in debt. The girlfriend's test of his reaction to a financial crisis is also questionable. \n\nOn the other hand, breaking up and evicting someone can be harsh. Maybe communication could have resolved the issue. But the author tried to communicate, and the girlfriend didn't take it seriously. The author's actions could be seen as self-preservation. So, is he in the wrong? If the relationship was unequal and the girlfriend's behavior was exploitative, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
