Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe author is asking if they're at fault for breaking up with their girlfriend because she couldn't pay rent. They mention that she expected the guy to pay for everything, and even though he helped out with dinners, events, trips, and groceries, she didn't contribute equally. When they moved in together, she started off splitting the rent but then stopped due to her debts. The author ended up paying the full rent, which caused financial strain for them. The breaking point came when the girlfriend said she couldn't pay anything again, and the author kicked her out. The girlfriend later said it was a test to see how he'd react in a tough situation.\n\nSo, the main issue is financial responsibility in a relationship. The author believes they've been fair by paying for most things but expects some reciprocity. The girlfriend, on the other hand, hasn't contributed financially, leading to the breakup. \n\nI need to consider relationship norms. In many modern relationships, splitting costs is common when living together. The author might have felt that since they were a couple, sharing expenses was part of the partnership. The girlfriend, however, didn't see it that way, perhaps expecting the guy to cover everything. \n\nThe author's actions: They ended the relationship and asked her to leave because she couldn't pay rent. The girlfriend's response about it being a test suggests she might have been trying to see if the author would support her in times of need. But the situation here is different from an accident; it's more about ongoing financial irresponsibility. \n\nIs the author in the wrong for expecting financial contribution from a partner when they live together? It might depend on the understanding both parties had. If there was an unspoken agreement that the guy would pay everything, then the author might be in the right. But if there was an expectation of splitting costs, then the girlfriend is in the wrong. \n\nThe author tried to be accommodating, even when the girlfriend couldn't pay, but there's a limit to how much one person should support another financially. The key here is the imbalance. The author is taking on all financial responsibilities, which could be unsustainable and unfair. \n\nRelationships require mutual support and compromise. If one person is consistently taking without giving back, it can lead to resentment. The author's decision to end the relationship might be a reasonable response to protect their own financial stability. \n\nThe girlfriend's attitude of expecting the guy to handle everything and not contributing when she can might be the root of the problem. The author's reaction, while firm, might be justified given the financial strain. \n\nHowever, communication could have been an issue. The author might have not clearly communicated their expectations about financial responsibilities earlier, leading to misunderstandings. If the girlfriend felt she couldn't meet her share, maybe they could have found a different arrangement. \n\nIn conclusion, the author's actions stem from the need to maintain their own financial health. While they could have handled it more tactfully, the core issue is the girlfriend's lack of contribution. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong.\n"
