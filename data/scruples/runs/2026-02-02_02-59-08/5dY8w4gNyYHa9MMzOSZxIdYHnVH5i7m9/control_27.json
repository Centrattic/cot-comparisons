Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"Am I the Asshole\" scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a breakup because the girlfriend couldn't pay rent. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author mentions that he believed in the guy paying most but expected some give and take. The girlfriend moved in and for six months didn't pay rent or bills, except for occasional cleaning. Then when they moved in together, she couldn't pay her share due to her debts. He ended up paying full rent multiple times, which put him in a tough financial spot. She seemed to think it was his responsibility to support her financially, even saying something like \"why do I have a boyfriend then?\" when he asked her to help. \n\nThe key points here are financial responsibility in a relationship and mutual contributions. Relationships typically require both parties to contribute fairly, whether it's money, chores, or emotional support. The girlfriend's behavior seems to indicate she didn't take her share of the financial responsibilities, relying solely on the author. The author, while initially paying more, had expectations of some reciprocity, which weren't met. \n\nHe did try to communicate, asking her to pay him back or contribute, but she didn't respond. The argument is whether he overreacted by asking her to leave. However, given that this is their shared home and financial strain, it's reasonable for him to expect her to contribute. The girlfriend's attitude of testing his reaction in a crisis (like an accident) is concerning, as financial responsibility isn't the same as an emergency. \n\nThe author's decision to end the relationship over this seems justified. He's prioritizing his own financial stability and setting boundaries. It's clear he tried to be accommodating, but the imbalance became unsustainable. The girlfriend's lack of willingness to contribute, despite his efforts, supports the author's actions.\n\nSo, considering all this, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
