Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong for breaking up and kicking their girlfriend out of the apartment because she couldn't pay rent. \n\nFirst, the situation: The couple moved in together and initially split the rent. The girlfriend started not paying her share, citing her own debts. The author ended up paying the full rent, which caused them financial strain. The girlfriend claimed it was a test to see how he'd react in a tough situation.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Let's look at the arguments. On one hand, the author had to cover all the rent, which is unfair and puts a financial burden on them. The girlfriend's inability or unwillingness to contribute could be seen as a significant issue in a shared living arrangement. The author's decision to ask her to leave might be justified because they can't sustain the financial commitment alone.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's reaction of immediately kicking her out and breaking up might be seen as harsh. Maybe there could have been a discussion about a plan to address the financial issues, especially if the girlfriend is facing her own debts. Also, the girlfriend's comment about it being a test might indicate a lack of consideration for the author's financial situation, but it's unclear if she genuinely couldn't pay or was just testing him.\n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to consider both perspectives. Financial responsibility in relationships is a common point of conflict. The key here is whether the author's actions were a reasonable response to a partner not contributing to shared living costs. The author likely felt forced to take action to protect their own financial stability, which is a valid concern. However, the abrupt nature of the breakup without trying to work through the issue could be a point of contention.\n\nIn many relationships, financial issues require compromise and communication. If the author didn't try to find a middle ground before deciding to end the relationship, that might make their decision seem hasty. But given the recurring issues and the girlfriend's lack of accountability, the author might have felt it was the only solution.\n\nI think the main factors are the financial responsibility of both parties and how they handled the problem. The author's decision to end the relationship might be seen as necessary for their own well-being, but the method could be questioned. However, given the context, it's a complex situation where neither side is entirely right or wrong. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Considering the girlfriend's repeated failure to contribute and the author's financial strain, I lean towards the author not being in the wrong. So the answer would be B.\n"
