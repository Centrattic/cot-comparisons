Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the AITA post) is in the wrong for breaking up and kicking their girlfriend out because she couldn't pay rent.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the key points from the story. The couple moved in together, initially split the rent, but then the girlfriend couldn't pay her share due to her debts. The author paid the full rent, which put them in a tough financial spot. When the girlfriend again couldn't pay, the author decided to end the relationship and asked her to leave. The girlfriend later said it was a test to see how he'd react in a crisis.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that they can't keep covering all the expenses when their own financial situation is also under strain. The girlfriend's argument is that she's testing how he'd handle her emergencies, implying that he should be the financial back-up.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Let's consider both sides. Financial responsibility in relationships is complex. If both partners agree on how to split costs, that's one thing. But if one expects the other to cover everything, especially when their own finances are struggling, it's unfair. The author tried to split the rent initially but the girlfriend couldn't pay, leading to the author shouldering all costs. The author's decision to end the relationship because of the financial burden might be seen as justified if they felt it was unsustainable. However, kicking someone out of a shared home without a clear plan or mutual agreement could be considered harsh, especially if there's no alternative provided.\n\nThe girlfriend's behavior\u2014using the situation as a test without transparency\u2014might be inconsiderate. But the author's response of immediate eviction might be seen as overly harsh, even if justified financially. The question is whether the author overreacted. If they discussed the situation and the girlfriend wasn't forthcoming, then the author's decision makes sense. But if the author didn't give her a chance to find a solution or if the eviction was abrupt without support, then maybe they overstepped.\n\nIn many cases, communication before an ultimatum is key. The author did try to discuss repayment, but the girlfriend wasn't responsive. The author's anger is understandable given the financial strain. However, relationships involve mutual support, and if the author was willing to help with her debts, expecting some reciprocity is reasonable. The girlfriend's test argument is weak because a financial emergency isn't the same as choosing not to pay rent when you can.\n\nConsidering cultural norms, some societies expect the man to take on more financial responsibility, but that's changing. The author believed in paying for most things but expected some give and take. The girlfriend's lack of contribution, especially after moving in together, might have been a deal-breaker. \n\nIn terms of fairness, if the author set clear expectations about splitting expenses and the girlfriend couldn't meet them, then the author isn't wrong for ending the relationship. However, kicking someone out of their home is a drastic step. But since it's their apartment, the author might have the legal right to ask her to leave if they're the primary tenant. Still, relationships should ideally be handled with more empathy and discussion rather than immediate eviction.\n\nSo, balancing both sides: the author had valid financial concerns and a lack of reciprocity. The girlfriend's actions were inconsiderate and lacked transparency. The author's reaction was a last resort after multiple issues. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
