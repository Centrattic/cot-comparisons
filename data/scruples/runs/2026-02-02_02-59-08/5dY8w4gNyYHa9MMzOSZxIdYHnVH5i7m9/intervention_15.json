Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a breakup because the girlfriend couldn't pay rent. The author believes the guy is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides.\n\nFirst, the couple moved in together. Generally, when two people live together, it's expected that they split the expenses, unless otherwise agreed. The woman couldn't pay her share due to her debts, which the man found unacceptable. He broke up with her and kicked her out. \n\nThe man had a history of paying for most things, including groceries and events. The woman did some cleaning but it wasn't equal. When they moved in together, they split rent initially, but she later couldn't contribute because of her debts. He paid the full rent, which caused him financial strain. When she said she couldn't pay again, he told her to leave.\n\nThe woman claims she was testing how he'd react, like if she had an accident. The man thinks this is different. \n\nFrom a financial responsibility standpoint, if two people are in a committed relationship and share a home, contributing to shared expenses is reasonable. If one can't contribute because of personal debt, that's a problem. But the man had a pattern of covering most costs before moving in. Maybe he set expectations that he'd pay for things, but when it came to rent, he expected her to split it. There's a mismatch in expectations here. \n\nThe woman's inability to pay rent might be due to her financial situation, but if the man knew about her debts beforehand and still moved in with her, maybe he should have had a clearer agreement. However, expecting someone to pay rent when they can't due to debts is unrealistic. On the other hand, the man's reaction of kicking her out because she couldn't pay might be harsh, especially if there's no alternative housing. \n\nBut the man is also in a bind because his financial situation is strained. He's trying to manage his own debts. If the woman isn't contributing, he's bearing the full burden. The fact that she saw it as a test and didn't communicate better might be part of the issue. The man's frustration is justified if he felt he was covering all costs without reciprocity. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. If the woman couldn't pay rent, she should have discussed it earlier. The man might have overreacted by kicking her out, but his right to expect his partner to contribute to shared expenses is valid. It's a tough call. Some might say the man is in the right because financial responsibilities are part of a partnership. Others might argue that kicking someone out for financial reasons is extreme. \n\nConsidering all this, the man's actions might be seen as justified given the lack of contribution and communication from the woman. However, the way he handled it could be criticized. But the core issue is financial responsibility in a shared living situation. I think the man is not in the wrong because the woman wasn't contributing her fair share, leading to the breakup. Answer B.\n"
