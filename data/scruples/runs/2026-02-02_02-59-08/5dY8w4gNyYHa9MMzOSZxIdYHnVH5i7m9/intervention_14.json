Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about breaking up and kicking their girlfriend out of the apartment because she couldn't pay rent.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author mentions that the girlfriend moved in and initially didn't pay rent or bills, only cleaning sometimes. Then they moved in together, split rent for a while, but she couldn't pay anymore. The author paid the full rent, which put them in a tough financial spot, and now she's not contributing again. The author kicked her out after she said she couldn't pay and even claimed it was a test.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants another opinion. The possible answers are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI should consider factors like financial responsibility in a relationship, communication, and fairness. The girlfriend's inability to pay rent is a practical issue, but the author's actions of kicking her out might be seen as harsh, especially if there was a lack of communication about expectations. However, the author also mentions that they were struggling financially because of this. \n\nThe girlfriend's attitude that the guy should pay everything is a red flag. The author tried to help but felt it wasn't equal. When they moved in together, splitting rent is standard, so the girlfriend not contributing could be a deal-breaker. The author's reaction might be justified if they felt exploited and couldn't sustain the financial burden. \n\nBut, is kicking her out the wrong move? Maybe there could have been a discussion about alternative arrangements, but the situation seems to have escalated to a breaking point. The girlfriend's test comment adds another layer, implying manipulation. \n\nI think the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They set boundaries and couldn't handle the financial strain. But it's a tough call. However, the key points are mutual responsibility in shared living and the girlfriend not meeting her obligations. The author's decision, while harsh, might be seen as self-preservation. So the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
