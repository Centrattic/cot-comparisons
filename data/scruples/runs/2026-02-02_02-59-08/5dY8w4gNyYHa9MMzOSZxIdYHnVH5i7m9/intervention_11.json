Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this situation. So, the person is asking if the author is in the wrong for breaking up and kicking their girlfriend out of their apartment because she couldn't pay rent.\n\nFirst, the background: the couple moved in together, and initially split the rent. The girl then couldn't pay her share due to her debts. The author paid the full rent, which put them in a tough financial spot. The next month, the girl said she could pay a few hundred but didn't follow through. When the author asked about paying rent or repaying, the girl responded with \"why do I have a boyfriend then?\" which led the author to kick her out. The girl later said it was a test for how he'd handle a tough situation, but the author thinks that's different.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author is wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides.\n\nLet's look at the dynamics. The author mentions that they believed the guy should pay for most things, but there should be a give and take. The girl moved in and for six months didn't pay rent or bills, only cleaning occasionally. Then when they moved in together, they split rent for a couple of months. The girl then couldn't pay, leading the author to pay the full rent. The girl's attitude seems to be that the boyfriend should handle her financial issues, which the author finds unfair.\n\nThe author's actions: paying the full rent when the girl couldn't, and then after another failure to pay, asking her to leave. The girl's response about it being a test complicates things. But the author's main point is that the financial burden is unfair when his own finances are struggling. \n\nFrom a financial responsibility standpoint, when cohabiting, splitting expenses is usually expected unless otherwise agreed. The girl's inability to meet her share, knowing the author is already in debt, might be seen as a failure to maintain the partnership. The author's frustration seems valid here. However, the way the breakup happened\u2014kicking her out\u2014might come off as harsh, especially if there was no prior agreement about such scenarios. \n\nThe girl's behavior of using the relationship as a test for her own financial needs seems manipulative and unfair. The author's decision to end the relationship over this could be seen as justified because they can't continue in a partnership where one person is consistently a financial burden without reciprocation. \n\nHowever, there's also the aspect of communication. Did the author address the financial issues earlier? The story mentions the author felt the contributions weren't equal, but perhaps didn't set clear boundaries before moving in together. That could be a point where the author might share some responsibility. But given the circumstances now, where the girl is actively unable to pay and the author is being asked to cover everything, breaking up might be a reasonable decision to protect their own financial health.\n\nConsidering all that, the author might not be in the wrong. The girl's expectations were unrealistic, and the author acted to protect their own situation after repeated issues. So, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
