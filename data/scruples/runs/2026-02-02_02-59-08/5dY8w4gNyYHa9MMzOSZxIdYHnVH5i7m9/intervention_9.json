Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a breakup where the author kicked his girlfriend out because she couldn't pay rent.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author mentions that he believed the guy should pay for most things but expected some give and take. When they moved in together, they split rent initially. But then the girlfriend couldn't pay due to her debts, and this happened again the next month. The author paid full rent both times, which put him in a tough spot financially. He finally kicked her out after she said she couldn't pay again and implied that he should handle it because they're in a relationship.\n\nThe girlfriend's perspective, as presented, is that she couldn't pay because of her own financial issues. She also thought the guy should cover it, and she even mentions it was a test to see how he'd react in a tough situation. The author is frustrated because he's covering all the costs, which affects his own finances and debts.\n\nNow, considering relationship norms. It's common for couples to share expenses when living together. If the girlfriend can't pay her share due to financial issues, it's a problem, but expecting the partner to cover it every time without any reciprocity might be unreasonable. The author did try to split the rent initially, but the girlfriend couldn't contribute. However, the author's reaction was to kick her out, which seems extreme. Maybe there could have been a discussion about alternative arrangements, like a temporary adjustment until she could get back on her feet. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is in a precarious financial position himself. If he's taking on more debt by paying the rent alone, that's a valid concern. Relationships require compromise, and if one person is consistently dependent without contributing, it can strain the relationship. The girlfriend's attitude of expecting the partner to handle everything without giving back might be the root issue here. \n\nThe author might feel that his financial stability is being compromised, and he's justified in setting a boundary. However, kicking her out immediately after a disagreement might be seen as harsh. The question is whether the action was proportionate to the situation. If communication failed and there was no attempt to find a middle ground, maybe the author overreacted. But given the repeated instances of her not contributing, he might feel it's necessary to protect his own finances.\n\nThe girlfriend's claim that it was a test adds another layer. Testing how someone reacts during a crisis is not a healthy dynamic, so her approach could be problematic. Still, the author's response of completely evicting her might be too extreme, especially if there's no eviction process legally. However, since they're in a lease together, maybe he can legally require her to vacate if she can't pay her share, depending on local laws.\n\nIn terms of fairness, relationships need mutual support, but also mutual responsibility. The author might be right in expecting his partner to contribute, especially in shared living. If she's unable to do so, it's a conflict that needs resolution. But the method of resolution (kicking her out) might be too abrupt. A more collaborative approach could have been better, but given the repeated issues, the author's frustration is understandable.\n\nSo, considering all this, I think the author's actions were a reaction to ongoing financial strain and lack of reciprocity. While kicking someone out isn't ideal, the context of financial stress and the girlfriend's expectations might justify his decision. However, maybe he could have handled it more gracefully. But given the situation, he's not necessarily in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
