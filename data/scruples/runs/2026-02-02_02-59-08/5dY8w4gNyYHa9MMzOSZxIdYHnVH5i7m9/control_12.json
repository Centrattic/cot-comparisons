Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong after breaking up with his girlfriend and kicking her out because she couldn't pay rent.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the situation from both perspectives. The author mentions that he believed the guy should pay for most things but there should be some give and take. He supported her financially with dinners, events, trips, and groceries. When they moved in together, she initially split the rent but then stopped, citing her own debts. He paid the rent, which put him in a tough spot. When he asked her to pay back or contribute, she refused, leading him to kick her out.\n\nThe key points here are financial responsibility and communication. The author expected a mutual effort in paying for shared expenses, which is reasonable. He had tried to compromise by splitting the rent initially, but when she couldn't pay, he took responsibility but it became unsustainable. The girlfriend's refusal to contribute, even after discussions, might be seen as not pulling her weight, especially since she was living in his apartment. Her response that she considered it a test of his reaction adds another layer; some might see this as manipulative.\n\nHowever, there's also the aspect of how he handled the breakup. Kicking someone out might be seen as harsh, but if they had agreed to split the rent and she wasn't contributing, he could argue it's about financial fairness. The question is whether his reaction was justified given the circumstances.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might argue that she had her own financial struggles and expected her partner to support her. But expecting a partner to cover all expenses without any contribution could be unrealistic. The author's frustration is valid if the financial burden became too much.\n\nConsidering all this, the author's actions seem like a last resort after multiple attempts to resolve the issue. While breaking up can be emotional, the decision to end the relationship due to financial disagreements isn't inherently wrong, especially if there was a lack of compromise from both sides. The key here is whether the author's actions were a reasonable response to the situation. Since the girlfriend didn't contribute to shared expenses and refused to meet halfway, the author's stance on financial responsibility makes him not in the wrong. So the answer is B.\n"
