Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for breaking up and kicking his girlfriend out because she couldn't pay rent. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author mentions that he believed the guy should pay for most things but expected some give and take. They moved in together, split rent initially, but the girlfriend couldn't pay her share due to her debts. When the author paid the full rent, the girlfriend stayed with a friend for a week. Then, when the next rent came due, she said she couldn't pay at all, leading him to kick her out.\n\nThe girlfriend's main argument is that she was testing how he'd react in a tough situation, like an accident. The author feels wronged because he's covering all costs, which strains his finances. \n\nI should consider both sides. On one hand, the author might have set up the situation where he expected her to contribute, and when she couldn't, it was a legitimate reason to feel betrayed. On the other, maybe he should have had a more open conversation about financial expectations before moving in together. \n\nBut the key points here are mutual responsibility in a relationship. Living together usually implies sharing responsibilities, including rent. If the girlfriend knew she couldn't pay and didn't communicate better, that's a problem. The author might have been naive in expecting her to contribute without a clear agreement. However, when she couldn't pay, he had to make a decision for his own financial stability. \n\nThe girlfriend's attitude of \"why do I have a boyfriend then?\" suggests a lack of consideration for his situation. The author's decision to end the relationship when she's not contributing might be seen as self-preservation. While there could be better ways to handle conflicts, the author's actions seem justified given the circumstances. So, he's not necessarily in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
