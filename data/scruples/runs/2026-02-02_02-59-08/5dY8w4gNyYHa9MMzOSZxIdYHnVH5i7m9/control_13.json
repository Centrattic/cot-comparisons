Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves a breakup where the man kicked his girlfriend out because she couldn't pay rent. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the man mentions that from the start, he paid for most things, and she only contributed occasionally. Then when they moved in together, she stopped paying rent. He ends up covering the full rent, which strains his finances, and she justifies it by saying \"why do I have a boyfriend then?\" He kicks her out after she can't pay for two months. She later claims it was a test of his response to tough situations.\n\nSo, the main points are about financial responsibility in a relationship. The man is upset because he's bearing all the financial burden, and she's not contributing. From his perspective, it's unfair. But from her side, maybe she's in a difficult financial situation herself. However, when people live together, splitting rent is usually expected. If she couldn't pay her share, that's a problem. The man is left in a bad financial spot because he keeps covering her part. \n\nIs he in the wrong? Well, he did agree to split the rent initially. If she couldn't pay, maybe he should have addressed it earlier. But she was in debt, so maybe it's not entirely her fault. Her attitude of expecting the guy to pay everything from the start might be an issue. But the key point is that when they moved in together, mutual agreement on splitting expenses is important. If she couldn't meet her part and he's shouldering all, that's a valid reason to end the living arrangement. \n\nThe question is about whether he's wrong. If he kicked her out because she couldn't pay rent, that's a practical decision based on financial necessity. But relationships also require communication. Maybe he should have tried to find another solution before breaking up. However, her behavior of not contributing and expecting him to cover everything, even after discussions, is a red flag. So, he's acting in self-interest, but is he wrong? Probably not. She's in the wrong for not contributing and testing his response. Therefore, the answer is B, No, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
