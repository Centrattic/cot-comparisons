Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who broke up with his girlfriend and kicked her out of his apartment after she couldn't pay rent is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend moved into his apartment and initially didn't pay rent or much else. They ended up moving in together and splitting rent for a while, but then she stopped contributing because of her own financial issues. The author paid the full rent twice, which caused him financial strain. He then decided to end the relationship and asked her to leave, leading to her being out of the apartment for the rest of the lease.\n\nThe key points here are financial responsibility and mutual expectations in a relationship. The author tried to support her by paying for things, but felt it was unequal. When they moved in together, splitting the rent was a mutual agreement, but she couldn't fulfill her part. The author's frustration is understandable, especially since he's taking on the entire financial burden, which is impacting his own debts and bills. \n\nHowever, there's a part where the girlfriend claims she was testing his reaction, which might indicate she wasn't upfront about her financial situation. The author's decision to ask her to leave because she couldn't contribute her share could be seen as his right, especially if they had an agreement. But kicking someone out of a shared living space without legal process might be an issue. Unless they had a specific agreement that she would pay rent and she violated it, the author might need to follow proper legal eviction procedures. If he just asked her to leave without following legal steps, that could be problematic. \n\nOn the other hand, if they had an informal agreement and she isn't holding up her end, the author is justified in ending the relationship and ending their living arrangement. The emotional aspect of the girlfriend's test is a red flag, but the author's reaction might be appropriate given the circumstances. \n\nFinancial support in relationships can be complex. While some people believe the man should pay more, the expectation of mutual contribution is important. If one person is consistently not contributing, it can create imbalance. The author's frustration with her lack of financial responsibility led to the breakup, which is a personal decision. However, the method of kicking her out might depend on their legal arrangements. If it was a lease under his name, he might have the right to end the tenancy, but if she had rights as a tenant, he might need to go through proper channels. \n\nIn summary, the author's actions could be seen as justified based on the girlfriend's failure to contribute and the resulting financial strain. However, the method of removal might be an issue if not handled legally. Since the question focuses on whether he's in the wrong in general, and given the context provided, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because he acted based on mutual agreements and his own financial well-being.\n"
