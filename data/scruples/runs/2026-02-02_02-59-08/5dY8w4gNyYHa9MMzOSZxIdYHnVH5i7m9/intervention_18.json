Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole?) story is in the wrong. The situation is about breaking up and kicking out a girlfriend because she couldn't pay rent. The author mentions that he believed the guy should pay for most things but expected some give and take. When they moved in together, he agreed to split the rent, but she couldn't pay for several months, leading to his decision to end the relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of the relationship. The author says he paid for most things, including rent, groceries, etc., which he thought was okay as the guy, but there was an imbalance. Financial responsibility is a big deal in a shared living situation. When people move in together, splitting bills is usually expected unless there's a prior agreement otherwise. The girlfriend's inability to pay rent might be due to financial struggles, but the author might have felt it was unfair to bear the entire burden.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is also a point. She said it was a test to see how he'd react in a tough situation. That seems dismissive and possibly manipulative. If someone is in a committed relationship and can't meet their financial obligations, expecting the partner to cover them indefinitely without any reciprocity is a problem. The author's frustration is understandable, especially when his own financial stability is at risk.\n\nHowever, the author's response was to kick her out. While he had a right to be upset, the decision to end the relationship might have been hasty. Maybe open communication could have led to a solution, like a temporary arrangement while she got her finances in order. But the girlfriend didn't seem to take responsibility, which could justify the author's actions. \n\nFinancial issues are a common cause of breakups. The author might not be wrong to prioritize his own financial health. On the other hand, if the relationship was already strained and the break wasn't handled with care, that could be a point against him. Still, the key issue is the mutual agreement on splitting the rent. If she agreed and then couldn't pay, and he was okay with covering it once but now is facing ongoing issues, his decision might be justified. \n\nThe girlfriend's attitude that \"why do I have a boyfriend then?\" implies she views the partner as a financial support system, which is an unhealthy dynamic. The author's stance that there should be give and take is reasonable. So, while the author could have handled it more gracefully, the core issue of financial responsibility in the relationship might mean he's not in the wrong. \n\nI think the answer leans towards B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the girlfriend didn't fulfill her agreed-upon responsibilities, leading to a justified decision to break up. The test comment adds to the problem, showing a lack of consideration. The author's actions were a result of her not contributing, which is a valid reason.\n"
