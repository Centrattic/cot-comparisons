Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a breakup because the girlfriend couldn't pay rent. The user wants a straightforward answer, A or B, but I need to think through the reasoning first.\n\nSo, the author's girlfriend moved in, and initially, the author paid most expenses. When they moved in together, they split rent for a while, but then the girlfriend stopped contributing due to her own debts. The author ends up paying all the rent despite financial strain, leading him to kick her out. The girlfriend claims it was a test to see his reaction to tough situations.\n\nFirst, financial responsibility in relationships is a key factor. The author mentions that he believed the guy should pay most, but there should be some give and take. The girlfriend's lack of contribution, especially after moving in together, seems to be a problem. The author was paying for everything, and when he asked for help, she couldn't contribute. That's a valid issue because living together typically requires shared responsibilities.\n\nThe girlfriend's reasoning that the boyfriend should handle all financial issues because she has her own debts might be seen as unfair. If both are in a committed relationship and living together, splitting costs is a common expectation unless otherwise agreed. The author's frustration is understandable, especially since his financial situation was also affected.\n\nThe girlfriend's claim that it was a test for an emergency scenario is a bit concerning. Using another person's financial struggles as a test seems manipulative. The author overreacted by kicking her out, but considering the context of ongoing financial strain and lack of reciprocity, his actions might be seen as a necessary measure to protect his own financial stability.\n\nHowever, there's also the aspect of communication. Did the author address the financial contributions earlier? He mentions trying to discuss it but not getting a response. Maybe he could have set clearer boundaries from the start. But given the timeline and the girlfriend's consistent inability or unwillingness to contribute, especially after the move-in, the author's decision to end the relationship might be justified.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author acted to protect his financial well-being and set boundaries. The girlfriend's approach was problematic. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
