Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend and kicking her out because she couldn't pay rent. The scenario is a bit complex, so I need to break it down.\n\nFirst, the background: The author and his girlfriend moved in together. Initially, he paid most of the expenses, which she sometimes helped with. Then, when they moved in together, he expected them to split the rent. However, she couldn't pay her share, leading to financial strain on him. When he confronted her, she refused to help, leading to the breakup.\n\nNow, the key points to consider. Financial responsibility in relationships is a common issue. The author mentions that he believes the guy should pay for most things but expects some give and take. However, when they moved in together, splitting the rent is a standard practice. The problem arises when she can't or won't contribute, causing him financial stress.\n\nThe girl claims she's in a financial situation where she can't pay, and she even says it was a test to see how he'd react. The author is frustrated because he's covering her costs while his own debts grow, leading him to kick her out.\n\nLegally, if they're living together and sharing an apartment, both are responsible for the rent. If one can't pay, the other might have to cover it, but that's a financial burden. Emotionally, the author felt taken advantage of, especially since he's been covering most expenses before. The girlfriend's attitude of expecting the guy to pay everything might be an issue, but her financial inability complicates things.\n\nThe author's actions: Breaking up and asking her to leave might be seen as harsh, but he's in a tough spot financially. She wasn't contributing, and he couldn't sustain the financial burden. On the other hand, maybe he should have addressed the issue earlier, set clearer boundaries, or found a compromise instead of kicking her out in the heat of the moment.\n\nThe girlfriend's test explanation is a bit concerning. Using a relationship to test someone's financial reliability during a crisis isn't healthy. But if she's in genuine financial trouble, it's a matter of empathy versus responsibility. The author's frustration is valid, but his response might have been too abrupt.\n\nConsidering all factors, the author might be in the right because he set boundaries and followed through when they were violated. However, some might argue he should have handled it more gracefully. The key is whether he acted unreasonably. Since he tried to negotiate and she refused, his decision to end the relationship could be justified.\n"
