Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the author (the person who wrote the AITA post) is in the wrong for breaking up and kicking out his girlfriend because she couldn't pay rent. Let me break down the details.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend moved into his apartment and lived there rent-free for six months. Then they moved in together and split the rent initially. But she stopped paying her share due to her own debts. The author paid the full rent, which put his own finances in a bad spot. When she couldn't pay again, he kicked her out. She later said it was a test to see how he'd react in a tough situation, but he argues that's different from a real accident scenario.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants others' opinions. I need to determine if the author's actions were justified. Let's look at the key points.\n\n1. **Financial Responsibility**: The author was paying all the rent and other bills, which the girlfriend wasn't contributing to. This could be a point where the author felt wronged, as relationships often require shared financial contributions. But was it his responsibility to cover everything?\n\n2. **Expectations and Communication**: The author mentions that he believed the guy should pay for most things, but there's a need for give and take. The girlfriend might have expected the author to always cover her, but if that's not the case, maybe there was a miscommunication. However, after moving in together, splitting rent is standard, and if she couldn't meet her share, maybe the author had a right to address it.\n\n3. **Kicking Her Out**: The immediate reaction was to kick her out. Is that an appropriate response? If they were in a lease together, the author might have a legal obligation to pay the rent, but if the girlfriend was staying in his apartment without contributing, maybe he had the right to ask her to leave. However, doing so abruptly and without considering alternatives (like a payment plan or moving out) could be seen as harsh.\n\n4. **Her Justification**: She called it a test for how he'd react to a crisis, like an accident. The author argues that this is a different scenario. Whether her actions were manipulative or a genuine financial hardship is unclear. If she was testing him, that's on her, but if she's in real debt, maybe there's some sympathy.\n\n5. **Emotional vs. Financial**: Relationships often involve compromise. The author might feel betrayed by her not contributing financially, but breaking up and evicting her could be seen as overreacting, especially if they were in a committed relationship. On the other hand, if the financial strain was significant, it's understandable.\n\n6. **Fairness**: Splitting rent is expected when moving in together. If she couldn't contribute, maybe the author shouldn't have agreed to move in together. But once they did, expecting her to pay her share is reasonable. However, the author's response was to kick her out immediately, which might be seen as disproportionate if they could have found another solution.\n\nPutting it all together: The author had a right to expect financial contributions from a partner in a shared living situation. When she failed to meet her responsibilities, leading to his own financial strain, his frustration is understandable. However, the way he handled it\u2014kicking her out without considering alternatives\u2014might be seen as harsh. The key is whether the author's actions were a justified response to a financial commitment breach or an overreaction. The girlfriend's testing behavior doesn't excuse her not paying, but the author's decision to end the relationship abruptly might be seen as him prioritizing his finances over the relationship, which could be viewed as his choice but not necessarily wrong. \n\nIn many cases, people might say that if you're in a relationship, you should work through financial issues together. But if the other person consistently doesn't contribute and causes financial harm, it's reasonable to leave. So, depending on perspective, the author might not be in the wrong. However, some might argue that he should have addressed the issue earlier rather than letting it escalate to eviction. But given the details, the author's actions could be seen as a legitimate response to being taken advantage of financially.\n"
