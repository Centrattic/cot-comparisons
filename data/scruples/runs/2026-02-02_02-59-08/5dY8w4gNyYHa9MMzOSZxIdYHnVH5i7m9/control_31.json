Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who broke up with their girlfriend and asked her to leave because she couldn't pay rent is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend moved in and initially didn't pay rent or bills. The author mentions she sometimes paid for things like groceries or cleaning, but it wasn't equal. Then, when they moved in together, she agreed to split the rent, but later couldn't pay because of her own debts. The author ended up paying the full rent, which put him in a tough spot. When she couldn't pay again, he kicked her out.\n\nThe girlfriend later said it was a test to see how he'd react in tough situations, like an accident. The author is conflicted about whether he overreacted.\n\nI need to consider both perspectives. On one hand, the author was covering all the costs, including rent, which is a significant financial burden. He might have felt it was unfair to bear all the expenses alone. On the other hand, the girlfriend might have expected support during her financial difficulties, seeing it as a test of how he'd handle her needs.\n\nFinancial responsibilities in relationships can be tricky. If both partners agreed to split the rent and bills, then not fulfilling that agreement can strain the relationship. However, the author's decision to ask her to leave because she couldn't pay might be seen as harsh, especially if there was an expectation of support in times of need. But if the agreement was mutual to split costs, then the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for enforcing that agreement when she couldn't meet her part.\n\nThe girlfriend's claim that it was a test for potential emergencies complicates things. If she was testing his commitment without prior discussion, that could be seen as manipulative. However, real emergencies versus personal financial mismanagement are different scenarios. The author might have felt that her lack of contribution was unsustainable, especially if it's affecting his own financial stability.\n\nIn terms of fairness, relationships should ideally have mutual support, but there's a limit to how much one person should bear the burden. The key points are whether there was an understanding about financial responsibilities and if both were aware of the expectations. If the author felt the arrangement was unequal from the start and the situation wasn't improving, his actions might be justified. However, the way he handled the breakup (kicking her out) could be seen as extreme, but given the financial implications, it might be a necessary step for him.\n\nSo, considering both sides, it's a bit of a toss-up. The author did what he felt was necessary to protect his financial situation, but the girlfriend's lack of contribution might have been a known issue before. The answer hinges on whether the author had a prior agreement and if he communicated his expectations clearly. If he did, then he's not in the wrong for enforcing it. If not, maybe he's partially responsible for not setting clear boundaries earlier.\n"
