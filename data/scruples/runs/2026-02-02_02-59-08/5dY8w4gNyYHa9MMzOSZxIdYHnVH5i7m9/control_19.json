Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for breaking up and kicking their girlfriend out because she couldn't pay rent. The situation involves financial expectations in a relationship.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that the girlfriend expected the guy to pay for most things, including rent. They moved in together, split rent initially, but she couldn't pay her share later. The author ends up paying the full rent, which strains their finances. The girlfriend's reasoning for not paying is that she has her own debts and bills, and even says it was a test to see how he'd react in tough times.\n\nFinancial compatibility is crucial in relationships, especially when living together. The author points out that the girlfriend wasn't contributing equally, which led to financial stress. The girlfriend's refusal to pay rent, even after being asked, seems like a significant issue. The author's decision to end the relationship and ask her to leave because of this financial responsibility might be seen as justified because they can't sustain the relationship under those terms.\n\nHowever, arguments could be made about communication. If the author had discussed their financial expectations earlier, maybe they could have found a solution. But the girlfriend's attitude of expecting the guy to cover everything and her use of \"test\" as a reason might indicate a lack of responsibility or consideration. The author's financial strain from covering all expenses likely contributed to their decision. \n\nIn relationships, especially when sharing living expenses, both partners should contribute. If one partner is consistently unable or unwilling to contribute, the other might feel it's unsustainable. The author's actions, while harsh, might be seen as necessary to protect their own financial stability. The girlfriend's behavior, expecting support without reciprocity, could be the root of the problem here. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because they acted to address a situation where financial responsibilities weren't balanced.\n"
