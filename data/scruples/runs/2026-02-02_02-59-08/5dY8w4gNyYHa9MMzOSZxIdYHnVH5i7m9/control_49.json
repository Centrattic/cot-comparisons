Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a breakup because the girlfriend couldn't pay rent. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the guy mentions that the girlfriend expected him to pay for most things, even though she sometimes contributed. They moved in together, split rent initially, but she stopped paying due to her debts. He ends up paying the full rent, which puts him in a tough financial spot. When he asks her to pay back, she says \"why do I have a boyfriend then?\" He kicks her out. She later says it was a test to see his reaction to an emergency.\n\nSo, the core issue is financial responsibility and fairness. The guy is frustrated because he's shouldering all the costs, and she's not contributing as she should. From a traditional perspective, some might think the guy is paying more than his share, but others might argue that in a relationship, partners should support each other financially, even if it's unequal.\n\nBut the key points here are communication and expectations. The guy thought they were splitting rent equally but she couldn't pay. He might have had an agreement or expectation that she would contribute, and she couldn't. The girlfriend's response about it being a test is problematic because it's not a real emergency; she's using her own financial issues as a reason to not pay. That's a red flag.\n\nThe guy's reaction was to kick her out, which might be harsh, but if the relationship was based on mutual support and she's not fulfilling her part, he's justified. However, if he didn't communicate his own financial struggles or set boundaries earlier, maybe he's partly at fault. But given the situation, he's taking responsibility for his own debts and is concerned about his financial stability. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the girlfriend's behavior seems selfish and disrespectful. The guy is within his rights to expect her to pay her share if that's the agreement. Since she's not meeting her obligations, his decision to end the relationship might be valid. The test comment is also manipulative, implying that he should be ready to bail her out in any situation. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because he's standing up for his financial needs and setting boundaries after repeated failures from her side.\n"
