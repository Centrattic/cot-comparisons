Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for breaking up and kicking their girlfriend out because she couldn't pay rent. I need to analyze the situation based on the details provided.\n\nFirst, the setup: The couple moved in together, and initially, the guy paid most of the expenses. The girlfriend did some chores but not equally. Then when they moved in together, the guy covered the rent for her, but she couldn't pay her share later. He was put in a tough financial spot and decided to end the relationship when she refused to pay.\n\nSo, the main issue is financial responsibility in a relationship. The guy might feel that he's been supporting her financially, leading to his own financial strain. The girlfriend seems to believe the guy should handle most expenses, and when he can't, he breaks up with her. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, relationships require mutual effort and compromise. If one person is consistently shouldering more responsibility, especially financially, and the other isn't contributing, it can lead to conflict. However, the breaking point here is when the girlfriend can't pay her part due to her own debts. The key is whether the guy was reasonable in expecting her to contribute. \n\nFinancial expectations in relationships vary, but it's generally advisable to have an agreement. The guy might have set expectations for her to help with rent, especially when they moved in together. If she knew that and later couldn't meet her part, leading the guy to feel exploited, it's understandable. However, kicking her out without considering other options (like mediation, working out a payment plan, or seeking help) might seem harsh. But given the context of her previous non-payment and the financial strain, maybe it's justified. \n\nThe girlfriend's attitude of expecting the guy to handle everything and then testing his reaction doesn't help. The guy's decision might be a last resort after multiple issues. So, is he in the wrong? It's a tough call. He might not be in the wrong because he's prioritizing his own financial stability, which is important. However, if there's a lack of communication or if he didn't try to work it out, maybe he overreacted. But given the repeated problems and her lack of contribution, the decision to end it could be seen as justified. So the answer might be B (No, he's not in the wrong).\n"
