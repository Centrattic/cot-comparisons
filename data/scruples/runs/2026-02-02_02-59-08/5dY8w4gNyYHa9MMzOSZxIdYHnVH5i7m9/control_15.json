Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is a guy who's in a relationship where he ended up paying most expenses, including rent when they moved in together. His girlfriend didn't contribute financially, even after moving in with him. She claimed she couldn't pay due to her own debts, and when he asked her to pay or repay what he had already covered, she refused, leading him to kick her out. She later said it was a test to see how he'd react in a tough situation. Now the author is being asked if he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I should consider the key points. The author mentions that he believed the guy should pay for most things, but there should be some give and take. However, in the situation where they moved in together, splitting the rent was expected, but she stopped contributing. When he tried to address it, she refused to help and even rationalized her position by saying it was a test. The author then decided to end the relationship and asked her to leave because he couldn't afford to cover everything alone.\n\nNow, thinking about shared living arrangements, when two people move in together, especially in a committed relationship, it's typically expected that both contribute to shared expenses like rent and bills. If one person stops contributing, it can create financial strain. The author was paying the full rent alone, which put him in a precarious financial situation. He had to choose between his own bills and hers. That's a significant issue because financial responsibility is a common topic in relationships, and expecting one person to cover all costs without any contribution could be seen as unfair.\n\nThe girlfriend's behavior doesn't seem to be addressing the problem. When asked to pay, she refused and even suggested that the author should handle it because she has a boyfriend. That's a problematic attitude because it implies that financial support is a given without any contribution from her side. Also, her claim that it was a test for an emergency situation seems like an excuse rather than a valid reason. Emergencies are unpredictable and can't be planned for in such a way. If someone uses a hypothetical emergency as a test, that's not a reasonable approach.\n\nThe author's response was to end the relationship and ask her to leave. Given that she wasn't contributing and the financial burden was becoming unsustainable, this might be a reasonable step. The author might feel that he can't maintain the relationship under these conditions, especially if mutual support is important. It's about respect for each other's financial responsibilities. If one partner is consistently taking without giving, and the other feels it's unfair, ending the relationship could be justified.\n\nHowever, there are also factors to consider. Was the author's approach too harsh? Did he give her enough chances to contribute? He mentions that she paid occasionally in the past but it wasn't equal. When they moved in together, they agreed to split the rent initially, but she stopped. He tried to negotiate repayment, but she didn't comply. The final straw was her refusal to help, leading to him asking her to leave. It seems like he gave her multiple opportunities to participate financially, which is fair. His frustration is understandable given the financial stress.\n\nAnother angle is the girlfriend's reasoning. If she couldn't pay due to her debts, maybe there's a deeper issue that wasn't addressed. However, she didn't communicate effectively or seek solutions. Instead, she left for a week and then returned without addressing the problem. Her behavior might indicate a lack of responsibility or consideration for the author's financial situation.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a complex situation. The author might not be in the wrong because he's taking a stand for his financial well-being. Relationships require mutual support, and if one person is unwilling to contribute, it can lead to resentment and conflict. The author's decision to end the relationship in this context could be seen as justified, especially since he tried to communicate and reach a solution, which she didn't reciprocate.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that relationships involve compromise, and the author could have handled the situation differently, like setting clearer boundaries earlier or seeking legal advice on roommate responsibilities. But given the information, the author did address the issue multiple times, and the girlfriend's responses were uncooperative. His actions might be a reasonable outcome based on the circumstances.\n\nSo, considering all points, the author isn't in the wrong. His decision to break up and ask her to leave was a response to her financial irresponsibility and lack of contribution in their shared living situation. The girlfriend's attitude and behavior contributed significantly to the breakdown of the relationship.\n"
