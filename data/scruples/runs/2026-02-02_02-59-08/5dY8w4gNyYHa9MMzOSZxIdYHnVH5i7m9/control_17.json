Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who broke up with their girlfriend for not paying rent is in the wrong. The situation is that the couple moved in together, and the girlfriend couldn't pay her share of the rent due to her own debts. The author paid the full rent, leading to financial strain, and eventually asked her to leave when she couldn't contribute.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. The author mentions that even before moving in, the girlfriend expected the guy to pay for most things, and she only contributed occasionally. When they moved in together, splitting the rent was part of the agreement. The girlfriend's inability to pay led to the breakup. \n\nLegally, if they are co-tenants, both are responsible for the full rent regardless of personal agreements. But since they split up, the author is now shouldering the entire cost. However, the question is about moral or relational fault, not legal. \n\nThe author's frustration is understandable because they feel financially burdened. The girlfriend's behavior\u2014staying with a friend for a week and not contributing\u2014might have tested the author's patience. The girlfriend's reasoning that her lack of payment was a test for hypothetical emergencies seems selfish. The author had to cover the rent, which affected their own financial obligations.\n\nIn relationships, mutual support is important, but there's a balance. If one partner consistently relies on the other without reciprocation, it can lead to resentment. The author's decision to end the relationship when the girlfriend couldn't contribute might be seen as standing up for their own financial stability. However, some might argue that the author could have communicated better or found a compromise earlier. \n\nBut given the repeated failures to contribute financially and the girlfriend's justification as a test, the author's actions could be viewed as reasonable. They prioritized their own financial health, which is crucial. So, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
