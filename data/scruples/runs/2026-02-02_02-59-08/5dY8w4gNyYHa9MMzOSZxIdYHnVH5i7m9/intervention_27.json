Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for breaking up and kicking his girlfriend out because she couldn't pay rent.\n\nFirst, looking at the situation: The girlfriend moved into his apartment, and for six months, she wasn't paying rent, bills, or groceries, only cleaning occasionally. Then, when they moved in together and agreed to split the rent, she couldn't pay, leading to financial strain on the author. The final straw was her not contributing at all again, prompting him to kick her out.\n\nThe author argues that he expected some give and take, but she was in the mindset that he should pay everything. When she couldn't pay, he felt it was unfair and took action. The girlfriend's excuse was that she was testing him, which he found unreasonable.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, splitting rent when living together is standard. If one person can't pay, it's a problem. But the girlfriend's initial six months without paying anything is a red flag. The author tried to accommodate her by paying for most things, but it led to financial issues for him. His decision to end the relationship because she wasn't contributing financially might be seen as self-preservation. However, some might argue that breaking up over money isn't the healthiest approach, but in terms of right or wrong, he's protecting his financial stability. The girlfriend's test explanation seems like an excuse, not a valid reason. So, the author might not be in the wrong here.\n"
