Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author had a girlfriend who moved into his apartment. Initially, she didn't pay rent or much else, and he covered most expenses. When they moved in together, they agreed to split the rent, but she couldn't pay because of her debts. The author paid the full rent, which strained his finances. Now, she can't pay again, and he kicked her out, saying he can't keep covering her share. She says it was a test to see how he'd handle a tough situation. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, let's look at the financial responsibilities in a relationship. Generally, when two people live together, it's expected they contribute to shared expenses. If someone moves into another's apartment, they should have a clear agreement on who pays what. The author mentions that she was living rent-free for six months, which is a problem. Even if he believed the guy should pay more, there should be some mutual contribution. However, the author seems to have let this slide, maybe out of kindness or not setting boundaries early on.\n\nWhen they moved in together, splitting rent is standard. The girlfriend's inability to pay due to her debts is a valid issue, but she should have communicated this upfront. The author paid the rent when she couldn't, but when she couldn't pay again, he decided to kick her out. The girlfriend's justification that it was a test doesn't justify her not contributing when possible. It's a bit of a passive-aggressive way to test his commitment, which is unfair.\n\nThe author's reaction was to end the relationship and ask her to leave because he couldn't keep covering her share. Given that they were in a committed relationship and living together, expecting some financial support is reasonable, but it shouldn't be one-sided. The author tried to compromise by splitting the rent initially, but when that failed, he was forced to take full responsibility, which hurt his finances. His frustration is understandable.\n\nHowever, the key point is whether the author overreacted. By kicking her out, he ended the relationship because of financial disagreements. While the girlfriend's lack of contribution is a problem, ending the relationship might be a harsh response. They could have worked on a plan for her to pay back or adjust their financial arrangements. But the girlfriend's attitude of expecting the guy to handle everything and her test justification might have pushed the author to his limit.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't entirely wrong for setting boundaries, but maybe he could have handled it differently. However, given the repeated financial strain and the girlfriend's lack of accountability, his decision to end the relationship isn't unjustified. The girlfriend's behavior was inconsiderate, and the author had the right to prioritize his own financial stability. So, the answer would likely be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
