Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the person who broke up with their girlfriend over her not paying rent is in the wrong. \n\nFirst, the user moved in with his girlfriend, and initially, she didn't pay rent or bills. He covered most of the expenses, expecting some give and take. Then when they moved in together, they split the rent for a while. But she couldn't pay her share due to her own financial issues, and he ended up covering it. Now, she's not paying at all again, leading to the breakup.\n\nHe's frustrated because he's shouldering all the financial responsibility, which is putting him in a tough spot. He called her out for not contributing and kicked her out. She thought it was a test of his commitment.\n\nI need to consider the fairness of financial responsibilities in a relationship. While it's common for some costs to be shared, expecting each other to cover all expenses without contribution might be unreasonable. The user might have gone overboard by evicting her without considering other solutions, like setting up a payment plan or seeking alternatives. However, his financial strain is valid, and he might have set boundaries that she crossed. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's approach of not paying and seeing it as a test seems irresponsible. The user's actions could be seen as a necessary step to protect his own financial stability. Whether he's in the wrong depends on if there were other reasonable options he didn't explore. But given the circumstances, his reaction might be justified. \n\nI think the answer is B, No, the author isn't in the wrong because he set boundaries and couldn't sustain the financial burden alone. The girlfriend's lack of contribution and her testing attitude might have led to the conflict, making the breakup a reasonable decision.\n"
