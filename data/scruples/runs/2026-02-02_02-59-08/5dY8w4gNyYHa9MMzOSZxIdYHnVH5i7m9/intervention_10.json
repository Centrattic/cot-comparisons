Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a breakup because the girlfriend couldn't pay rent. The author is asking if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the details. The couple moved in together, and initially, the author paid for most things, expecting some give and take. When they moved in together, they split the rent for a few months. But then the girlfriend couldn't pay, so the author paid the full rent. The next month, she couldn't pay again, and when the author asked for payment, she said \"why do I have a boyfriend then?\" which led the author to kick her out. The girlfriend later said it was a test.\n\nSo, the key points are financial responsibility in a relationship. Both partners in a shared living situation usually split costs. If one can't contribute, it's a problem. The author might feel wronged because they're covering all costs, but maybe they should have set clearer boundaries earlier. However, the girlfriend's attitude of expecting the guy to pay everything might be problematic. \n\nThe user thinks the author is wrong, but I need to evaluate. Was it fair for the author to kick her out after the second time? Maybe they should have discussed the financial situation more and considered alternatives, like a temporary adjustment instead of eviction. But on the other hand, the girlfriend's behavior shows a lack of responsibility. She's putting the author in a tough spot financially. \n\nThe author might be in the right because they set a boundary when the other person wasn't meeting their financial obligations. However, the decision to kick someone out is significant and could be seen as harsh if other options weren't explored. But given the repeated failure to contribute, the author might have no choice. \n\nThe girlfriend's \"test\" claim is a red flag. It suggests she might be using the author's financial help to test their commitment, which isn't responsible. The author might be justified in ending the relationship when financial contributions aren't possible. \n\nSo, considering both sides, the author might not be in the wrong. The girlfriend's actions and lack of contribution led to the situation. The author made a tough decision but within their rights to protect their own financial stability.\n"
