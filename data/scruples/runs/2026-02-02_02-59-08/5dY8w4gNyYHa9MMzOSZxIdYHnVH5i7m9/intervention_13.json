Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) question is in the wrong. The situation is that the author broke up with his girlfriend and kicked her out of their shared apartment because she couldn't pay rent. The girlfriend moved in in June 2018 and didn't pay rent or bills for six months. Then, when they moved in together, she couldn't pay rent again, leading to the author paying full rent and eventually asking her to leave.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the financial responsibilities in a relationship. The author mentions that he believed the guy should pay for most things but expected some give and take. Initially, the girlfriend didn't pay rent for six months, which is a significant period. Then, even when they moved in together, she couldn't contribute to rent. The author ended up covering all expenses, which put him in a financial strain. \n\nThe girlfriend's justification was that she had her own debts and couldn't pay rent. The author felt it was unfair that he had to cover everything while his own financial situation was being compromised. When he confronted her, she said it was a test to see how he'd react, which he found unacceptable. He then asked her to leave the apartment.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides. Legally, if they were in a lease together, both would be responsible for rent. If the girlfriend refused to pay her share, the author might have a right to ask her to leave, especially if she was violating the lease terms. However, the emotional aspect is important too. The author's frustration is understandable, as he's shouldering all financial burdens. \n\nBut did he handle it appropriately? Kicking someone out of an apartment can be a severe action. In some cases, legal procedures are required if someone is on the lease. However, if the lease was under him alone, he might have the right to ask her to leave. The key here is whether there was a mutual agreement on splitting rent and if the girlfriend was breaching that agreement. The author's actions could be seen as justified if she was consistently not fulfilling her part of the financial agreement. \n\nThe girlfriend's test comment seems dismissive and doesn't address the real issue. Her behavior of not contributing and then blaming the situation on a hypothetical accident might not excuse her actions. The author's response, while harsh, might be a result of being pushed to his limit. \n\nIn terms of relationship dynamics, communication is crucial. The author might have failed to address the financial issues earlier, leading to a buildup of resentment. However, when push came to shove, his decision to end the relationship and ask her to leave could be seen as necessary for his own well-being and financial stability. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the author's actions might be justified given the repeated financial irresponsibility of his partner. While the method of kicking her out could be questioned, the underlying issue of financial responsibility is valid. Therefore, the author might not be in the wrong.\n"
