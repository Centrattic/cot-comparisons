Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about a breakup where the author kicked his girlfriend out because she couldn't pay rent. The key points here are the financial responsibilities in a relationship and whether the author's actions were justified.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author mentions that he initially paid for most things, and she occasionally paid for some things and cleaned. But when they moved in together, he expected them to split the rent. She failed to pay her share twice, leading to the breakup. The author argues that he was helping her with her financial issues, but she wasn't reciprocating, which caused him financial strain.\n\nNow, in terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. Financial responsibility in relationships can be a sensitive topic. The author might feel that he's being unfair by taking on all the financial burden, especially if he had a prior understanding that they would split the costs. However, the way he handled the situation\u2014kicking her out immediately and cutting off any support\u2014could be seen as harsh, especially if there was no prior agreement on how to handle financial difficulties.\n\nThe girlfriend's perspective is that she was in a tough spot with her own debts and perhaps expected the boyfriend to support her. She even mentioned it was a test to see how he'd react in a crisis. While her approach of not paying rent might be irresponsible, the boyfriend's reaction of completely cutting her off without trying to find a middle ground might be seen as extreme. Maybe he could have communicated better, set clearer boundaries, or explored other solutions before ending the relationship.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to assess both sides. The author did take responsibility for his part in the relationship dynamics by acknowledging he might have gone along with the unequal setup. However, when it came to splitting rent, his expectations weren't met, leading to conflict. The key issue here is whether the author's actions were proportionate. If the girlfriend had a history of financial instability, maybe the author should have been more cautious or had a written agreement. On the flip side, the girlfriend's approach of not contributing to shared expenses could be considered a deal-breaker for the author, especially if it's causing him significant financial stress.\n\nIn many relationships, financial expectations are crucial. The author might have been in a position where he felt he couldn't sustain the financial burden, leading to his decision to end the relationship. However, the abrupt nature of kicking her out might not be the most mature or considerate approach, especially if there were no prior discussions about financial responsibilities. The girlfriend's test comment also shows a lack of empathy, but the author's reaction could be seen as a justified stand on his boundaries.\n\nConsidering all this, the author's actions might be seen as a last resort after repeated failures in communication and mutual support. While his method was harsh, his frustration is understandable given the financial strain. Therefore, I might lean towards the author not being in the wrong, but there's a strong case on both sides.\n"
