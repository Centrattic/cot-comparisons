Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. The author broke up with his girlfriend and kicked her out of their apartment because she couldn't pay rent. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the relationship started with the guy paying for most things, which he's okay with as long as there's some give and take. When they moved in together, they were splitting the rent initially. Then the girlfriend couldn't pay her share due to her debts. The author paid the full rent, which put him in a tough financial spot. Now she can't pay again, and he kicks her out, saying she's supposed to help him financially. She claims it was a test to see his reaction to a tough situation, like an accident. The author is wondering if he was wrong to do that.\n\nSo, from the author's perspective, he's frustrated because he's shouldering all financial responsibilities, and when it's time to split costs, she can't contribute. He feels taken advantage of. But the girlfriend's reasoning is that she's in a financial crisis, and maybe testing his commitment. \n\nI need to consider if the author's actions were justified. Paying for a partner's basic needs can be seen as a choice, but when it becomes unsustainable and one party isn't contributing, it's a problem. The key here is communication and mutual agreements. Did they discuss financial responsibilities upfront? The author says they moved in together and split rent for a few months, so maybe there was an understanding. When she couldn't pay, he tried to get her to pay back, but she didn't. The author then decides to pay the full rent, leading to his financial strain. His decision to end the relationship and kick her out is a response to her inability to meet her financial obligations.\n\nHowever, relationships require compromise. Maybe the author should have found a different solution, like moving out or finding a cheaper place. But he chose to end the relationship instead. The girlfriend's approach of not contributing and testing his reaction might be inconsiderate. However, the author's response of kicking her out without a plan for her to leave might be abrupt. If they were in a lease together, he might need to follow proper procedures for ending the tenancy, rather than just asking her to leave. That could lead to legal issues.\n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong if he didn't handle the situation legally or compassionately. However, if the financial strain was too much and the girlfriend wasn't willing to contribute, then the author's decision could be seen as self-preservation. It's a tough call because both parties have some responsibility. The girlfriend's debt is her own issue, but expecting her partner to cover everything indefinitely isn't fair. The author's actions might be justified if they had mutual agreements and he felt it was necessary to end the relationship. But the method of kicking her out without proper process could be problematic. \n\nI think the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong) because he's setting boundaries for his own well-being and financial stability. However, the way he handled the eviction might need to be more legal. But in terms of being \"in the wrong\" for the breakup and decision to end the relationship, he's justified.\n"
