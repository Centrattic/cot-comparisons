Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who broke up with his girlfriend and kicked her out of his apartment is in the wrong. The situation involves financial issues, splitting rent, and differing expectations in a relationship.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that he paid for most things, even when she was supposed to contribute. He believed the guy should pay for most things, but there needed to be some give and take. When they moved in together, she couldn't pay rent, leading to him covering the costs. The final straw was her refusing to pay anything, even when he asked her to repay him. He then kicked her out and she claims it was a test.\n\nI need to consider the dynamics here. Financial responsibility in relationships is a common issue. If both parties are supposed to share the burden, but one is consistently unable or unwilling to contribute, it can lead to conflict. The author might feel that his financial sacrifices are being taken advantage of. On the other hand, the girlfriend's inability to pay could be due to her own financial struggles, and she might have expected support as part of the relationship.\n\nThe key points are mutual financial contributions, communication, and expectations. The author might have been aware of her financial habits before moving in together. If he agreed to split the rent but she couldn't hold up her end, then breaking up might be his way of addressing the imbalance. However, kicking her out abruptly without considering alternatives (like a payment plan or discussing her financial situation more thoroughly) could be seen as harsh.\n\nThe girlfriend's approach of testing his reaction by creating a fake scenario (like an accident) isn't helpful. However, if the author had a history of covering her expenses without setting boundaries, he might have contributed to the problem. The question is whether the author overreacted by removing her from the apartment or if he was justified in protecting his own financial stability.\n\nFinancial responsibilities in a relationship require negotiation and compromise. If the author felt his limits were reached and he decided to terminate the relationship to manage his own financial health, that's a personal choice. But kicking her out immediately might not be the most considerate approach. However, given the circumstances described, it's a matter of differing values and priorities. The author's actions might be seen as self-preservation rather than being in the wrong.\n"
