Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a breakup because the girlfriend couldn't pay rent. The author, a guy, seems to have been paying most of the expenses even before they moved in together. When they moved in, they split the rent initially, but she stopped paying after a while due to her debts. The author ends up paying full rent and now she can't pay again, leading him to kick her out.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. The user mentions that the guy believes the guy should pay for most things but there should be give and take. However, in their case, it seems like the balance was tipped heavily towards him. She would occasionally pay for something, but mostly he covered everything, including rent after moving in together. \n\nFinancial responsibilities in a relationship can be tricky. When couples move in together, splitting rent and bills is common. If one person is consistently unable to contribute, it can create tension. The girl's justification that she's in a friend's place for a week might be an attempt to not pay rent, which the guy ends up covering. Then, when he asks her to pay back, she refuses, leading him to kick her out.\n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual responsibility. Did the author communicate his expectations clearly? It seems like he might not have set clear boundaries early on. He mentions he went along with the idea that he should pay for most things against his better judgment. This could have led to a situation where she didn't feel the need to contribute financially. \n\nWhen she couldn't pay rent, he paid it, but then she didn't follow through on paying him back. The author's frustration is understandable, especially since he's in a precarious financial situation. However, kicking her out without a plan for her might be seen as harsh. But considering she was in the mindset that the guy should pay everything and wasn't contributing, maybe the author had to take a stand for his own well-being.\n\nThe girl claims it was a test, which the author doesn't agree with. Her lack of communication and expectation that the author should handle all financial issues without reciprocation might be the root of the problem. The author's actions, while possibly abrupt, could be seen as a necessary step to protect his financial stability. \n\nOn the other hand, could the author have handled it differently? Maybe setting up a payment plan or having more open discussions about their financial responsibilities earlier. But given the circumstances, his decision to end the relationship and stop paying rent for her might be justified if he felt his own financial health was at risk.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It depends on whether his actions were a reasonable response to her consistent lack of financial contribution and the strain it placed on him. If the relationship was built on an unequal financial arrangement and she refused to adjust, then the author's decision to end it might be justified. However, if he didn't give her enough opportunity to contribute or communicate his needs clearly, he might share some responsibility. \n\nBut given the information, the author seems to have made a difficult decision to prioritize his own financial stability after repeated failures from the other person to meet her obligations. So, the answer might be that he's not in the wrong.\n"
