Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe person (the author) is asking if they're at fault for breaking up with their girlfriend and kicking her out of their apartment because she couldn't pay rent. They mention that she was in the mindset that the guy should pay for everything. The author supported her financially in many ways, like dinners, events, trips, and groceries, even though she occasionally paid for something and helped clean the apartment. The author doesn't have a problem with paying the majority, but they wanted some give and take.\n\nThen, when they moved in together, the girlfriend initially split the rent for a few months. But in February, she couldn't pay her share due to her debts, so she stayed with a friend for a week while the author paid the full rent. The author ended up in a tough financial situation but managed to cover their own bills. The next month, the girlfriend offered to pay a few hundred but later said she couldn't pay anything again. The author confronted her, and she responded that she didn't need to because she has a boyfriend. The author then kicked her out and refuses to let her move back in. They later discussed it, and the girlfriend said it was a test to see how he'd react in a crisis. The author is questioning if they overreacted.\n\nSo, the main issue is financial responsibility in a relationship. The author is upset because the girlfriend isn't contributing to shared expenses, which is causing financial strain. The girlfriend seems to have a different approach to financial responsibilities, expecting the boyfriend to handle it all. The author is taking a hardline approach by ending the relationship and removing her from the apartment.\n\nI need to consider if the author's actions are justified. Financial disagreements are common in relationships. The author might be right in expecting some contribution, especially since they moved in together. However, the way the author handled the situation\u2014kicking her out without a clear plan\u2014could be problematic. Also, the girlfriend's comment about it being a test might indicate manipulative behavior, which the author is justified in not tolerating. But if the author didn't have a prior agreement on financial responsibilities, it's their fault for not setting boundaries earlier.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is taking responsibility for their own bills and trying to manage their debt, which is commendable. The girlfriend's refusal to contribute might have been a red flag that the author ignored. The final decision to break up could be seen as self-preservation, especially if the relationship became one-sided. However, the abruptness of the action and the emotional response might make the author seem overly harsh. But considering the financial strain and the girlfriend's attitude, maybe it's justified.\n\nI think the key points are the lack of financial agreement beforehand and the girlfriend's expectation of the author to pay everything. The author might have been naive in assuming the relationship would balance out. But when pushed to a breaking point, taking action is understandable. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. However, there's a possible lack of communication and planning. But given the circumstances, their reaction seems justified.\n"
