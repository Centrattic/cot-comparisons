Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a breakup where the man kicked his girlfriend out because she couldn't pay rent.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the details. The couple moved in together, and initially, the guy paid most of the expenses, believing the guy should pay for most things but expecting some give and take. Then, after moving in together, she stopped paying her share of the rent. The guy ended up paying all the rent, which caused him financial strain. When he confronted her, she didn't take responsibility and even suggested it was a test to see how he'd react in a tough situation. He then kicked her out.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. To determine this, I should consider a few factors: financial responsibility in relationships, expectations, and communication. \n\nIn most relationships, especially when couples move in together, it's common to split expenses. However, the man initially thought the guy should pay for most things but expected some contribution. The problem arises when the girlfriend stops contributing entirely, leading to financial strain on him. He had to cover all costs, which he found unfair, especially since he's also dealing with his own debts.\n\nThe girlfriend's attitude seems to be that the guy should handle all expenses, and she didn't take responsibility when she couldn't pay. The man, despite his initial stance, tried to negotiate and even asked her to pay back, but she refused. Her justification of it being a test is problematic because it's not a typical or reasonable way to assess a partner's behavior.\n\nHowever, there's a nuance here. The man did kick her out, which might be a harsh reaction. But considering the context\u2014she was contributing nothing, causing him financial harm\u2014it's understandable that he'd reach a breaking point. The key points are mutual responsibility and communication. If the girlfriend had communicated her financial issues earlier and discussed solutions, maybe the situation could have been handled differently. Instead, she waited until the rent was due and then couldn't pay, expecting him to cover it without question.\n\nThe man's actions might be seen as self-preservation. He's protecting his financial stability, which is a valid concern. However, breaking up and evicting someone can be seen as extreme. But given the circumstances where she wasn't contributing and the man was already stretched thin, it might be justified. \n\nThe girlfriend's lack of responsibility and the man's attempt to maintain balance are central. The man's final reaction, while harsh, was a response to repeated financial neglect. The test comment from the girlfriend is a red flag, indicating a lack of accountability. \n\nSo, considering all this, the man's actions, while possibly abrupt, were in response to her not meeting her financial obligations. Therefore, he's not in the wrong. So the answer would be B.\n"
