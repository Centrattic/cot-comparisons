Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for breaking up and kicking his girlfriend out because she couldn't pay rent. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author mentions that he believed the guy should pay for most things but expected some give and take. The girlfriend moved in, initially split rent, but later stopped contributing due to her debts. The author paid the full rent, which strained his finances, and when she couldn't pay again, he kicked her out. She then claims it was a test to see how he'd react in a tough situation.\n\nI should think about financial responsibility in relationships. It's common for couples to split expenses when living together. If one partner can't contribute, it can create tension. The author set boundaries by expecting her to pay rent when they moved in together. When she couldn't, he tried to work it out but eventually had to cover everything. His frustration is understandable, especially if he's in a precarious financial situation.\n\nThe girlfriend's justification that it was a test seems dismissive. Testing someone's commitment by not contributing to shared living expenses isn't fair. The author had already made compromises before, helping with dinners and groceries. It's reasonable for him to expect some financial support when living together.\n\nHowever, breaking up and kicking someone out might be seen as harsh. But considering the financial strain and the lack of reciprocity, maybe it's a valid decision. The author isn't at fault for setting boundaries and prioritizing his own financial stability. He didn't force her to move in; she chose to. So when she couldn't meet her obligations, he took action to protect his own situation.\n\nIn conclusion, while the situation is complex, the author isn't in the wrong. He made an informed decision after repeated issues, and his actions were to maintain his financial health. The girlfriend's lack of responsibility and testing his limits contributed to the situation.\n"
