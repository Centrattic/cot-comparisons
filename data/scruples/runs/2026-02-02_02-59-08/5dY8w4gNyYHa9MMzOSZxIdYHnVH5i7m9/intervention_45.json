Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong when they broke up with their girlfriend and kicked her out after she couldn't pay rent. The user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The key points are that the couple moved in together, initially split the rent, but the girlfriend couldn't pay her share due to her debts. The author ended up paying the full rent, which caused him financial strain. When she couldn't pay again, he kicked her out. The girlfriend claims it was a test to see how he'd handle tough situations, like an accident. The author is frustrated because he feels he's been covering her expenses while his own financial issues grow.\n\nNow, considering financial responsibilities in a relationship. It's common for couples to discuss and agree on how to split bills. The author mentions that he believed the guy should pay most, but there should be give and take. The girlfriend contributed sometimes but not equally. When they moved in together, splitting rent is typical. However, if one can't pay, it's a problem. The author's frustration is valid because financial strain can cause stress in a relationship. Kicking someone out might be harsh, but if both can't meet their financial obligations, it's a practical issue. The girlfriend's attitude of expecting the guy to handle everything without reciprocity might be an issue. Her claim it was a test seems self-serving and dismissive of the author's struggles. \n\nOn the other hand, eviction is a serious matter. The author could have addressed it with communication first, maybe negotiating a payment plan or reconsidering their living arrangement. Kicking her out abruptly might be seen as extreme. However, if the situation was unsustainable and causing him financial harm, his decision might be justifiable. The key is whether the response was proportional. The author's actions stem from a place of financial necessity rather than malice. The girlfriend's lack of accountability and the author's financial strain are significant factors. \n\nIn terms of ethical considerations, the author isn't morally obligated to support her financially beyond what was agreed. However, relationships require mutual support. The girlfriend's behavior might have contributed to the breakdown. The author's decision, while harsh, might be a result of his own financial pressures and the imbalance in contributions. Whether he's in the wrong depends on whether the eviction was a necessary step given the circumstances. If the relationship was already strained by financial issues and communication failed, then the author's action, though severe, might not be entirely his fault. The girlfriend's lack of reciprocity and her dismissive attitude (\"why do I have a boyfriend then?\") shows a lack of understanding of the author's position. \n\nSo, balancing both sides, the author's actions are a response to financial strain and unmet expectations. While the method of kicking her out might be seen as abrupt, the underlying issues were not his fault. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong.\n"
