Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe person is asking if they're the asshole for breaking up and kicking their girlfriend out because she couldn't pay rent. The girlfriend moved in, and initially, she didn't pay much. They split rent for a while after moving in together, but then she stopped paying, citing her own debts. The author ended up paying all the rent, which put them in a tough financial spot. When the girlfriend couldn't pay again, he kicked her out. She later said it was a test to see his reaction in a crisis.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the financial arrangement. When two people live together, it's common to split rent and bills. The author mentions that he believed the guy should pay for most things but expects some give and take. The girlfriend didn't contribute, which led to the author having to cover all the costs. Financial strain is a big issue in relationships, and when one person isn't pulling their weight, it can create tension.\n\nThe author's actions: breaking up and evicting her. Legally, if they were co-tenants, he can't just kick her out without following proper eviction procedures. But maybe they weren't formal co-tenants, so he might have to go through the legal process. However, the question here is about moral wrong, not legal. So assuming he followed the right steps or she left voluntarily, then moving on.\n\nThe girlfriend's perspective: she might feel she's in a supportive relationship where the guy is supposed to take care of her. But the author felt it was unfair and that there needed to be reciprocity. The girlfriend's reasoning that if she can't pay, the boyfriend should help because that's why they have a boyfriend might come off as manipulative or unrealistic. However, if she had a temporary setback, maybe the author could have been more understanding, but if it's ongoing and she's not making an effort, maybe not.\n\nThe test comment is interesting. She said it was a test to see how he'd react. That might indicate she didn't take the situation seriously or was using it to see his commitment. The author might feel that her approach was wrong, expecting him to bear all the financial burden without any support.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, if the expectation was mutual contribution, and she wasn't contributing, then the author has a right to set boundaries. However, could he have handled it differently? Maybe communicated better, set clearer expectations from the start. But kicking her out because she couldn't pay might be seen as harsh if there were extenuating circumstances. However, if it's a pattern of behavior and she's not making an effort, then the author's actions might be justified.\n\nAlso, considering the initial setup: he believed the guy should pay for most things but there should be give and take. She wasn't giving back, so the author felt wronged. The final straw was her saying \"why do I have a boyfriend then?\" implying he should take care of her, which the author found unacceptable.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author might not be in the wrong if he set boundaries and the girlfriend wasn't meeting her responsibilities. However, if there were other factors like her financial difficulties being beyond her control, maybe the author could have been more supportive. But given the description, it seems like a mutual decision to split costs when moving in, and she failed to contribute, leading to the breakup. Therefore, the answer might be B (No), he's not in the wrong."
