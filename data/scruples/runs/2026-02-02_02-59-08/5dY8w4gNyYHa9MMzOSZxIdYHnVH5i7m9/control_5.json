Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a breakup because the girlfriend couldn't pay rent. Let me break down the details.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that he paid for most things like dinners, events, groceries, even though she paid occasionally and cleaned sometimes. He believed the guy should pay more but expected some give and take. Then she moved in, and for six months she didn't pay rent, bills, or groceries. They moved in together and split rent at first, but she stopped contributing eventually. When he had to pay full rent alone, he got angry and kicked her out. She later said it was a test for how he'd react to tough situations, but he thinks that's different from her actual financial irresponsibility.\n\nHmm. So the main issue here is financial responsibility in a relationship. The author felt he was carrying the financial burden, which he was okay with to a point, but when she couldn't contribute at all, he decided to end things. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nI need to consider cultural expectations. In some cultures, it's traditional for the man to pay, but the author mentions he expects some give and take. When moving in together, splitting rent is a common arrangement. If she couldn't fulfill her part of the financial agreement, that's a problem. The author had to cover all expenses, which put him in a tough spot financially. He might have felt it was unfair and that the relationship wasn't balanced.\n\nBut then she says she was testing him. That could be seen as manipulative, but maybe she thought she was being considerate by not burdening him. However, her not contributing to shared expenses when they live together is a valid issue. Financial responsibility is a key part of a committed relationship, especially when cohabiting.\n\nThe author's actions were to end the relationship when she couldn't meet her financial obligations. Whether that's right depends on perspective. If the relationship was based on mutual agreements, and she wasn't meeting her end, he's justified in walking away. However, if he had a prior understanding where he expected to cover her rent while she contributed in other ways, maybe he should have addressed it earlier instead of waiting until it blew up.\n\nBut according to the timeline, he tried splitting the rent initially, she stopped contributing, and he had to cover everything. His financial strain led to the breakup. It's possible he's not in the wrong because she wasn't fulfilling her part of the shared responsibilities when cohabiting. However, if he knew her financial situation before moving in together, maybe he should have set clearer expectations. But given the way he described it, he had been accommodating all along, which led to her expecting the same.\n\nIn summary, the author made a choice to end the relationship when she couldn't contribute financially. His actions are a response to her not meeting the agreed-upon responsibilities. Since the user is asking if he's in the wrong, considering the situation described, the answer would be that he's not in the wrong because she wasn't fulfilling her part, and he acted to protect his own financial stability.\n"
