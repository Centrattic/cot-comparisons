Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who broke up with his girlfriend over her not paying rent is in the wrong. From the story, it sounds like they moved in together, initially split rent, but she stopped contributing. He paid the full amount, which put him in a tough spot financially. Then she couldn't pay again, and he kicked her out.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. He mentions that he believed the guy should pay most things but there needs to be give and take. She moved in and for six months didn't pay rent, bills, or groceries much. Even after they moved in together, she stopped paying. He's now shouldering all financial responsibility, which is straining his own finances.\n\nHe broke up because she wasn't contributing, which seems to be a major issue for him. The question is whether he's in the wrong. On one hand, relationships require mutual support, but financial responsibilities are often shared in a partnership. If one person isn't contributing, it can create imbalance. He had to pay the full rent, which is a significant burden, and he decided to end the relationship because of it. \n\nBut wait, the girlfriend's reasoning was that she couldn't pay due to her own debts. That might be a valid problem, but relying on a partner to cover all expenses without any contribution could be seen as unfair. The user here (the author) might be in the right because he set boundaries when things became unsustainable. However, some might argue that in a relationship, partners should support each other through tough times, including financial ones. But the line is when one partner is taking advantage or not contributing at all.\n\nThe girlfriend's attitude of expecting the guy to pay everything, even after moving in together, seems problematic. The author tried to work with her, gave her chances to pay, but she kept failing. Then, when he confronts her, she seems to justify it as a test. That's really not healthy. So, the author's decision to end the relationship because of the financial imbalance might be justified. \n\nOn the other hand, some might think that in a committed relationship, financial support is part of the commitment, so he shouldn't have kicked her out. But this is more about the balance and communication. If he didn't address the issue earlier, maybe he's at least somewhat responsible. However, in this case, he did try to work with her, and she didn't reciprocate. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. The girlfriend's actions and attitudes were the main issues. He had a right to set boundaries and end the relationship when it became unsustainable. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
