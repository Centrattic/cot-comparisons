Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for breaking up and kicking his girlfriend out because she couldn't pay rent. Hmm. First, I need to understand the situation properly.\n\nThe author had a relationship where he was paying for most things, including rent after she moved in. They moved in together and initially split the rent, but then the girlfriend couldn't pay, leading to the author covering the full rent. When she couldn't pay again, he kicked her out. The girlfriend now claims it was a test to see how he reacts in tough situations.\n\nSo, the key points here are financial responsibility in a relationship and boundaries. The author feels he's being taken advantage of, while the girlfriend seems to expect support without contributing. The question is whether the author overreacted or was within his rights.\n\nFinancial contributions in relationships can vary, but mutual support and compromise are usually expected. If one partner is consistently shouldering all financial burdens, that can be a problem. The girlfriend's inability to pay rent and her dismissive attitude when confronted (\"why do I have a boyfriend then?\") might indicate a lack of consideration for the author's situation. \n\nHowever, the author's decision to kick her out because she couldn't pay rent could be seen as harsh. Relationships often involve support during tough times, but there's a balance. The girlfriend's claim that it was a test complicates things. Maybe she was trying to see if he'd help in a crisis, but her approach was impractical. \n\nThe author might have the right to expect financial contributions from a cohabiting partner, especially when they agreed to split the rent. Not contributing could be seen as a breach of that agreement. On the other hand, the way he handled the breakup might be abrupt, but given the financial stress, it's understandable. \n\nI need to determine if the author is in the wrong. If the girlfriend was in a financial crisis and couldn't pay, maybe the author could have found a different solution, like a temporary arrangement or a conversation about financial expectations. But the girlfriend's lack of effort to compensate in other ways (like more cleaning, paying for other expenses) and her attitude might justify the author's frustration. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might not be in the wrong because he's setting boundaries around financial contributions, which is reasonable. The girlfriend's behavior was likely the main issue, not the author's decision to end the relationship over it. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
