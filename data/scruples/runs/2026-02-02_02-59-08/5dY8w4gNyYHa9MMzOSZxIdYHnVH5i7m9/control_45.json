Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who broke up with his girlfriend and kicked her out because she couldn't pay rent is in the wrong. The options are A or B.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The guy had a girlfriend who moved in with him. Initially, he paid for most things, and she sometimes contributed. When they moved in together, they split the rent for a while. Then she couldn't pay, he paid the full rent, which strained his finances. Now she can't pay again, and she claims it's a test. He kicks her out.\n\nSo, the key points are financial responsibility and expectations in a relationship. The guy felt the contributions were unequal. She expected him to handle more, and when she couldn't pay, he took action. She sees it as testing his commitment.\n\nI need to consider societal norms. In many cultures, there's an expectation of shared responsibility in a relationship, especially financial when living together. If they were a couple, splitting bills is common unless they agreed otherwise. If she couldn't contribute, maybe they should have discussed it earlier. However, the guy's reaction was to kick her out, which might be harsh if there were no prior discussions about financial roles. \n\nBut the guy also mentions he believed the guy should pay for most but there should be give and take. He felt it was unequal. If she was aware of this and still didn't contribute, maybe his reaction is justified. However, kicking someone out of your home is a big step. Maybe he should have tried to resolve it through communication first. \n\nShe claims it's a test for emergencies. That seems manipulative. The guy's frustration is understandable. But was kicking her out the only option? Maybe setting up a payment plan or moving out. However, the situation is complex. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit gray. The guy might be in the right if he had clear boundaries and she violated them. But if he didn't set expectations from the start, maybe he shares some responsibility. However, the breaking point was her not contributing even after previous issues. So, he might not be in the wrong. So, answer B.\n"
