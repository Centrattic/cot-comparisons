Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. So the user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for breaking up and kicking his girlfriend out because she couldn't pay rent. The options are A (yes, he's in the wrong) or B (no, he's not). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author mentions that he's been in a relationship where he's been paying for most things, including rent after moving in together. The girlfriend didn't contribute equally, and when the situation became untenable because she couldn't pay rent, he kicked her out. She moved in with a friend and later claimed it was a test to see how he'd react in a crisis.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. Let's consider the factors. Financial responsibility in a relationship is a common issue. The author states he believed the guy should pay most, but there should be some give and take. The girlfriend's contribution was minimal, and when they moved in together, she stopped paying rent after six months and couldn't help with bills due to her debts. The author ends up paying full rent, which strains his own finances. \n\nHe got angry and kicked her out when she couldn't contribute. The girlfriend later claims it was a test, which the author considers different from an actual emergency. The key points here are about expectations, communication, and fairness in a relationship. \n\nIn relationships, financial discussions are crucial. The author might have set unclear expectations about splitting costs. The girlfriend might have misunderstood or didn't consider her contributions enough. However, when the situation leads to the author taking on all financial burdens, leading to his own financial stress, and the girlfriend isn't willing to help, the author might feel justified in ending the relationship. \n\nBut is kicking her out the right approach? That's debatable. Maybe he should have addressed the issue earlier, discussed financial planning, or found a compromise. However, given the circumstances where she repeatedly couldn't contribute and the author couldn't sustain the financial load, his reaction might be seen as a last resort. \n\nThe girlfriend's claim that she was testing his reaction adds complexity. If she was manipulating the situation to see his response, that's problematic. However, the author's response was to end the relationship, which could be justified given the lack of mutual support. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author might not be in the wrong. The girlfriend's lack of contribution and her testing behavior contributed to the problem. The author's decision to end the relationship might be seen as a necessary step to protect his financial well-being. Therefore, the answer would be B (no, he's not in the wrong).\n"
