Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. They provided the story and their own opinion that they think the author is in the wrong but want to know others' thoughts.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The author is a guy who ended his relationship and kicked his girlfriend out of his apartment because she couldn't pay rent. He mentions that she expected him to pay for most things, including rent, even after moving in together. The key points here are financial responsibility, expectations in a relationship, and communication.\n\nHe states that he was paying for most things, which he thought was okay as the guy, but there should be some give and take. When they moved in together, she initially split the rent but then stopped due to her own financial issues. The author pays the rent himself, leading to financial strain, and after repeated issues, he kicks her out. She later claims it was a test to see how he'd react in tough times.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, possibly because the girlfriend's financial struggles might be genuine, and the author could have handled it differently. But others might argue that the author had valid reasons to expect mutual financial contributions in a shared living situation.\n\nI need to consider relationship norms. Typically, in a shared living arrangement, especially a romantic one, splitting costs is expected. If one partner cannot contribute, it's a red flag. The author may have been patient for a long time, but when the situation becomes unsustainable, taking action is reasonable. The girlfriend's lack of accountability and her \"test\" comment could justify the author's decision. However, kicking someone out abruptly might be seen as harsh, but given the financial implications, some would support his action. It's a balance between compassion and responsibility. The answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong (B) because he took action after repeated failures to meet shared responsibilities.\n"
