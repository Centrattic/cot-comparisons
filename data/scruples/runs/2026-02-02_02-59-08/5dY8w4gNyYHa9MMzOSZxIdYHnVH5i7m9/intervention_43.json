Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up and kicking his girlfriend out because she couldn't pay rent. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nFirst, the couple moved in together. Initially, the guy paid for most things, including rent after she moved in. The girlfriend didn't contribute much financially, and when they moved in together, she stopped paying rent for a while. The author mentions that he believes the guy should pay for most things but there should be some give and take. However, in this case, it seems like the give and take wasn't happening. \n\nThen, the girlfriend couldn't pay rent in February and again later, leading the author to ask her to leave. He argues that he's in a tough financial spot now because he's paying full rent alone. The girlfriend's justification was that she was testing how he'd react in a crisis, but the author sees that as different. \n\nSo, the key points are financial responsibility, fairness in relationships, and boundaries. The author's actions are a response to financial strain caused by the girlfriend not contributing. But is that a valid reason to kick someone out? \n\nIn relationships, especially cohabiting ones, splitting expenses is usually expected. If one partner consistently doesn't contribute, it can create tension. The author tried to communicate and compromise, but the girlfriend didn't follow through. When she couldn't pay rent again, the author decided to end the relationship and ask her to leave. \n\nI need to consider if the author overreacted. The girlfriend moving out after not paying rent could be a reasonable step, especially if they had an agreement to split the rent. By not paying, she's breaking that agreement, and the author is holding him to financial responsibility. However, kicking someone out abruptly might be harsh, but given the context of repeated non-payment, maybe it's justified. \n\nThe girlfriend's argument that it was a test seems like an excuse. The author has a right to expect his partner to contribute financially, especially in a shared living situation. The author's actions were likely to protect his own financial stability, which is understandable. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. He acted to maintain fairness and his own financial well-being after multiple attempts to address the issue. Therefore, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
