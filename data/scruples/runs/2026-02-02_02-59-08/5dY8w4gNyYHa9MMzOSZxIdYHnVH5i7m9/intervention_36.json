Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author broke up with his girlfriend and kicked her out of his apartment because she couldn't pay rent. He mentions that he paid for most things, like dinners, events, trips, and groceries, while she only contributed occasionally. When they moved in together, they split the rent at first, but then she stopped paying, leading to the breakup.\n\nHe got angry when she couldn't pay her share, and after multiple instances, he decided she needed to leave. She later claimed she was testing how he would handle a tough situation, but the author thinks that's different from a real accident scenario. The user thinks the author might be in the wrong but wants to know my take.\n\nFirst, let's consider financial responsibility in relationships. When two people move in together, especially if they're in a committed relationship, splitting expenses is usually expected. The author took on the financial burden, which led to his own financial strain. However, the girlfriend wasn't contributing her share, which caused the problem. \n\nThe author's actions\u2014kicking her out\u2014might seem harsh, but he had a valid reason related to his financial stability. Relationships require mutual support, and if one partner is consistently not contributing, especially financially, it can create tension. The girlfriend's statement about it being a test to see how he'd react in a tough situation is problematic. Testing someone's limits with their financial situation might be considered manipulative or inconsiderate. \n\nOn the other hand, the author could have communicated better before resorting to kicking her out. Maybe setting clear expectations about rent contribution from the start would have helped. However, given the ongoing issues and her inability to pay, the author had to make a tough decision to protect his financial health. \n\nFinancial strain is a common reason for relationship breakdowns. The author's frustration seems justified because he was covering all expenses, and when the financial pressure increased, he couldn't sustain it alone. Kicking her out might be a harsh action, but it was a response to her consistent non-payment. \n\nThe girlfriend's mindset that the guy should pay for everything might have been an initial issue, but when they moved in together, it's reasonable to expect a split. The author's point about give and take is valid. The problem here is mutual: the girlfriend's lack of contribution and the author's expectation that she should contribute. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit tricky. The author's actions were a reaction to financial irresponsibility from his partner. However, the way he handled it\u2014kicking her out\u2014could be seen as extreme, but given the circumstances, it might be a necessary step. The girlfriend's testing behavior also indicates a lack of consideration for his situation. \n\nFinancial responsibility is crucial in relationships. If one partner is consistently not pulling their weight, the other has the right to reassess the relationship. The author's decision might be harsh, but it's a consequence of her inability to meet her financial obligations. \n\nAnother angle: Did the author have clear expectations from the start? When they moved in together, maybe they should have agreed on a plan for rent. If the girlfriend knew she couldn't pay, maybe she shouldn't have agreed to move in. The author might have been inconsiderate initially by expecting her to pay and then not setting boundaries. However, when she failed to meet her commitments, he had to act.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's response was firm, his actions were a result of ongoing financial strain caused by the girlfriend's inability to contribute. The girlfriend's behavior, especially the testing, shows a lack of responsibility. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
