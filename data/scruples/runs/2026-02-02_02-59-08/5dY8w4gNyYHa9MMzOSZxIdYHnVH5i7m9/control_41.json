Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong. The user is asking about a situation where the author broke up with his girlfriend and kicked her out because she couldn't pay rent. The key points here are about financial responsibility in a relationship and whether the author's actions were justified.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend moved in and initially didn't pay rent, which is a big issue. The author mentions that he believed the guy should pay for most things but expected some give and take. However, when they moved in together, splitting the rent logically makes sense. The problem arises when she can't pay her share, leading the author to take full responsibility, which strains his finances.\n\nThe author says he paid the full rent when she couldn't, which put him in a tough spot. Then, when she again couldn't pay, he kicked her out. The girlfriend suggested it was a test to see how he'd handle tough situations, like an accident. The author is conflicted about whether he overreacted.\n\nNow, considering financial responsibilities in relationships, it's generally expected that both partners contribute to shared expenses, especially when living together. If one partner consistently can't contribute, it can create financial strain. The author's decision to ask her to leave might stem from his own financial stress and the need for fairness. However, relationships also involve support during tough times. If the girlfriend had a valid reason for her financial struggles and the author was willing to help temporarily, maybe there's room for understanding. But if she wasn't making efforts to contribute at all, the author's stance is more justified.\n\nThe girlfriend's attitude of expecting the guy to pay everything, even after moving in together, might be problematic. The author's actions seem to be about maintaining financial stability, which is important. However, breaking up and kicking someone out can be harsh. But given the repeated issues with her not contributing, it's a reasonable response to protect his own interests.\n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. He tried to split the rent, she couldn't pay, and he had to cover it, leading to his financial difficulties. His decision to end the relationship when she continued to not contribute seems like a self-preservation move rather than being in the wrong.\n"
