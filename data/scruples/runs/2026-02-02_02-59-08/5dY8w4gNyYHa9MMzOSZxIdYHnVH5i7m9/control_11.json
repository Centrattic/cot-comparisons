Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. So the situation is about a breakup because the girlfriend couldn't pay rent. The user is asking if the author (the person who broke up) is wrong in the situation.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the details. The author mentions that from the start, the girlfriend had the mindset that the guy should pay for everything. He agreed against his better judgment. He paid for dinners, events, trips, groceries, etc., while she paid occasionally and helped with cleaning sometimes. He didn't feel the arrangement was equal. Then, when they moved in together, she stopped paying rent because of her debts, and he ended up paying full rent, which put him in a financial bind. After another month where she couldn't pay, he kicked her out.\n\nThe key points here are financial responsibility in a relationship and mutual contribution. The author feels that while he's okay with paying for most things, there needs to be some give and take. When they moved in together, splitting the rent was expected, but the girlfriend couldn't contribute. The author then had to pay everything, leading to his own financial stress. He broke up because he felt he couldn't support her financially without sacrificing his own needs.\n\nNow, considering societal norms and relationship expectations: many people believe that while the guy often pays for dates, both partners should share living expenses when cohabiting. If one partner is consistently unable to contribute and the other is shouldering all costs, that can create tension. The girlfriend's attitude of expecting the guy to pay everything without reciprocation might be seen as unfair, especially when they live together. \n\nHowever, the author might have overreacted by kicking her out immediately. Communication could have been better. The girlfriend mentioned it was a test to see how he'd handle her hypothetical accident, which is a bit manipulative. But the author's response of not wanting to pay full rent alone is understandable. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't in the wrong if the relationship's dynamics didn't have mutual contributions, especially in shared living expenses. The girlfriend's inability to pay rent isn't the author's fault, and he's justified in setting boundaries. However, the abrupt decision to kick her out might be seen as harsh, but given the financial stress, it's a reasonable choice. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The main issue was the imbalance in financial contributions, and the author acted to protect his own financial stability.\n"
