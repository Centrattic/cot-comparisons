Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let's start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe author is a guy who had a girlfriend who moved into his apartment. He mentions that she expected him to pay for most things, and he did, even though he thought there should be some give and take. When they moved in together, they split the rent at first, but then she stopped paying because of her debts. He ended up paying the full rent, which put him in a tough financial spot. When she couldn't pay again, he kicked her out. She later said it was a test to see how he'd react. Now the question is whether he's in the wrong for doing that.\n\nFirst, let's consider responsibilities in a relationship. Generally, when two people live together, splitting costs is a common arrangement. If one person can't contribute due to financial issues, that's a problem that should be discussed. The author paid for everything, which might be okay if both are willing to contribute in other ways. But the girlfriend didn't pay rent after moving in, relying on him financially. That's a big issue.\n\nThe girlfriend's actions: She moved in and didn't pay rent, which is a major responsibility. If she had a valid financial hardship, maybe they could have worked it out temporarily. But she kept saying she couldn't pay, even after he offered repayment. Her attitude seems to be that the boyfriend should cover everything without reciprocity. That's not fair in a relationship where shared responsibilities are expected.\n\nThe author's actions: He tried to split the rent but when she couldn't pay, he took the full burden. When she couldn't pay again, he kicked her out. He was in a precarious financial situation because of this. His response to her test was to end the relationship by removing her from his apartment. \n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. The girlfriend was not contributing her share, which is a significant issue. The author had to pay full rent, affecting his finances. He gave her chances to pay, but she didn't. The girlfriend's justification that it was a test is questionable. If she was testing his commitment, that's a red flag for manipulation. The author's decision to end the relationship under these circumstances seems justified. \n\nHowever, maybe there's a gray area. Did he handle it properly? Did he communicate clearly? He did try to discuss repayment and she didn't respond. He might have tried to resolve it before taking extreme steps. Kicking her out of his apartment was a serious action, but if she wasn't contributing to shared living costs, especially rent, it's a reasonable decision. \n\nIn relationships, financial responsibilities are important. The girlfriend's behavior was unfair, and the author acted to protect his own financial stability. So the author is not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
