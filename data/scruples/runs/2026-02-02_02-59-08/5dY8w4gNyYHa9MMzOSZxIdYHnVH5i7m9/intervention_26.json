Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong after breaking up and kicking his girlfriend out because she couldn't pay rent. The story details a relationship where he paid for most things, and when they moved in together, she stopped contributing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the financial responsibilities in a relationship. The author mentions he believed the guy should pay for most things, but expects some give and take. However, when they moved in together, splitting rent was expected, but the girlfriend couldn't pay. The author paid the rent, which caused him financial strain. Then, when she couldn't pay again, he kicked her out.\n\nThe key points here are mutual responsibility in a shared living situation and financial expectations. When people live together, especially in a romantic relationship, it's common to split expenses unless otherwise agreed. The author had initially agreed to split rent when they moved in together, which implies a mutual understanding. If one party can't contribute, it's a problem that needs discussion and adjustment. However, the girlfriend's inability to pay and the author's financial strain from covering her part led to the breakup.\n\nThe girlfriend's argument that it's a test for how he'd react to her hypothetical accidents is a bit concerning. Using someone's financial situation as a test seems manipulative. But the author's decision to kick her out because she couldn't pay might be seen as a reaction to her not meeting their agreed-upon responsibilities. \n\nHowever, breaking up and evicting someone solely because they can't pay rent might be harsh. If they had a verbal agreement to split rent and she couldn't meet her part, maybe they should have discussed alternatives, like a revised payment plan or other compromises. The author's response was immediate and extreme\u2014kicking her out without trying to find a middle ground. That might be where he goes wrong. Financial stress is tough, but handling it by removing someone from the home could be seen as overreacting, especially if there's no legal eviction process followed. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend's behavior of not contributing and expecting the author to cover everything might be a bigger issue. But the author's response could have been more constructive. Instead of abruptly ending the relationship and eviction, perhaps seeking mediation or discussing long-term solutions would have been better. \n\nIn summary, both parties have responsibilities. The author might have overreacted by not trying to work through the issue, but the girlfriend's lack of contribution is also problematic. However, since the question is about whether the author is in the wrong, the answer might depend on whether kicking her out was an appropriate response. Since the author took matters into his own hands without legal process and possibly without giving her a chance to adjust, he could be in the wrong. But if the agreement was clear and she violated it, then he might be justified. But given the context, it's more likely the author overreacted.\n"
