Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author did the wrong thing. So the situation is about a breakup because the girlfriend couldn't pay rent. The author is asking if he's the asshole (AITA) for breaking up and kicking her out. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the details. The user mentions that he believed the guy should pay for most things but there should be some give and take. From the timeline, she moved in in June 2018 and lived rent-free for six months. Then they started splitting rent, but she stopped paying because of her debts. The last straw was when she said she couldn't pay anything again, and he kicked her out. She claims it was a test to see how he'd react in a tough situation.\n\nNow, considering financial responsibility in relationships. If two people live together, splitting rent is standard unless otherwise agreed. The author did split initially, but she stopped contributing. He paid the full rent twice, which put him in a bad financial spot. He had to penny-pinch and couldn't pay off his loans as much. That's a significant burden. \n\nThe girlfriend's attitude seems problematic. She expects the guy to cover her expenses, even after agreeing to split. She didn't contribute equally in chores or rent. The author tried to compromise each time, but she kept not pulling her weight. When he finally confronts her, she says it's because she has a boyfriend to help her, which is not a valid excuse. Her testing his reaction by pretending to have an accident is a different scenario than actual debt issues. \n\nFinancial issues can strain relationships. The author's frustration is understandable. He's taking on more than his fair share, and she's not meeting her responsibilities. Breaking up because of this might be a hard choice, but if both parties aren't willing to compromise, it's a valid reason. \n\nIs he in the wrong? Well, he tried to work it out multiple times. When she couldn't pay, he had to make a decision. Since they were in a committed relationship living together, expecting mutual responsibility is reasonable. Kicking her out after she repeatedly failed to contribute might be justified. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe he could have handled it differently, like setting clearer boundaries earlier. But the situation escalated, and he did give her chances. She didn't take responsibility for her part. So, I think the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B (No).\n"
