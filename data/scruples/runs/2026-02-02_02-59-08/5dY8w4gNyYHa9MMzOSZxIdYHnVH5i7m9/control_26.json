Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for breaking up and kicking his girlfriend out because she couldn't pay rent.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the situation. The couple moved in together, and initially split the rent. Then the girlfriend couldn't pay her share due to her debts. The author paid the full rent, which put him in a tough financial spot. When she couldn't pay again, he kicked her out. She later said it was a test to see how he'd handle financial stress.\n\nThe key points here are financial responsibility and mutual agreement. When people move in together, they usually agree on splitting expenses. If one person isn't contributing, especially if they're aware of the financial strain, that's a problem. The author here tried to work with her, even letting her pay a bit when she could. But when she repeatedly failed to contribute and even dismissed the author's concerns by saying \"why do I have a boyfriend then,\" that's a red flag.\n\nThe girlfriend's attitude that the guy should pay for everything isn't healthy in a relationship. Relationships require compromise. The author isn't wrong for expecting some financial contribution, especially when it's affecting his own obligations. Kicking her out might be harsh, but given her lack of accountability and the financial stress she caused, it could be seen as a necessary step. Also, her claiming it was a test is problematic because it's not fair to expect someone to take on all the financial burden without reciprocity.\n\nHowever, communication is important. The author could have tried to address the issue more calmly before taking drastic action. But given the repeated failures and her dismissive attitude, his actions might be justified. It's a balance between being understanding and setting boundaries. The author's responsibility to his own financial stability is valid, so he's not necessarily in the wrong.\n"
