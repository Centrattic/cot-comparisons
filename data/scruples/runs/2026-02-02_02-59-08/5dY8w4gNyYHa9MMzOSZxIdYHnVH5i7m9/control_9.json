Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a breakup where the author kicked his girlfriend out because she couldn't pay rent. Let me break down the details.\n\nFirst, the user mentions that when they were dating, he paid for most things, even though she paid occasionally and helped with cleaning. But he felt the contributions weren't equal. Then, when they moved in together, she stopped paying rent due to her debts. He ended up paying the full rent, which caused him financial strain. When he asked her to pay back, she said \"why do I have a boyfriend then?\" which led to the breakup. She later said it was a test to see how he'd react in tough situations.\n\nHmm. So, from the author's perspective, he's trying to maintain a fair split of responsibilities, especially financially. He believed that while men should pay for most things, there should be some give and take. When they moved in together, splitting rent was part of the agreement. But when she couldn't contribute, he felt it was unfair to carry the full burden, especially since he had his own financial obligations. His reaction was to kick her out, which seems harsh, but maybe he felt it was necessary to protect his finances.\n\nNow, considering the other side: the girlfriend might have been in a tough financial situation due to her own debts. She might have expected her partner to support her, which some might argue is part of a relationship. But the user might have felt that expecting him to cover all expenses without any contribution is unfair. The girlfriend's response about it being a test is concerning because it implies she wasn't being honest, which can be seen as manipulative.\n\nThe key points here are mutual expectations and communication. Did they discuss financial responsibilities when moving in together? If they agreed to split the rent and she couldn't meet her part, then the author has a valid point. However, if the girlfriend was in a dire situation and couldn't pay, maybe the author could have found a different solution instead of evicting her. But the fact that she considered it a test shows a lack of consideration for his financial stress.\n\nLegally, if they were in a lease together, he can't just kick her out without following proper procedures. But since he's the one who initiated the breakup, maybe the legal aspect isn't the focus here. The moral aspect is about fairness and mutual support. The author might have overreacted, but given the repeated issues and lack of reciprocity, his decision could be seen as reasonable.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the author isn't in the wrong because he set boundaries, she didn't meet her financial responsibilities despite knowing the agreement, and her \"test\" shows poor judgment. The answer should be B.\n"
