Any dinner, event, trip, hell even groceries I would help out with. She would pay for something once in awhile, and she would clean my apartment from time to time but I never felt like it was equal. Not that I have anything against paying for things, I believe the guy should pay for most, but there has to be some give and take\n\nFast forward to June 2018. She moves in my apartment in the city. For six months she\u2019s living rent, bill, and virtually grocery free. Again she cleans but it\u2019s not even. \n\nFast forward again to now. We move in together so obviously we\u2019re going to split the rent right? For a couple of months we did. Then the last week of February she tells me she won\u2019t be able to pay anything for the rent due to her own debts and bills. I\u2019m furious and she goes and stays with a friend for a week. I pay the full rent which puts me in a precarious financial situation for my own bills and debts. I was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay some of my own things (I was able to with money left over.) then this month comes. She originally says she could pay a few hundred because again, her own debts and bills. I\u2019m wary but I say ok but you\u2019ll have to pay me back. No real response. We talk again the other night and now she says she can\u2019t pay anything at all again. I say ok so are you going to take care of the rent for a couple of months or pay me back? No because why do I have a boyfriend then?\n\nThis was the final straw. I\u2019m supposed to help you out with your financial fires while mine get larger and you\u2019re not even going to help me out when you can? Get the fuck out of my apartment. So once again, and for the rest of this lease, I\u2019m paying the full rent. Paying half of it I would be in good shape. Could pay off bigger amounts in my cards and loans, but now I really have to penny pinch until business gets up again which could be a few months. \n\nWe talked a couple days after this and she said it was a test to see how I would react in a tough situation. Like if she got into an accident or something. I believe this is a very very different situation but maybe I\u2019m wrong and I overreacted \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for breaking up and kicking his girlfriend out because she couldn't pay rent. I need to analyze the situation carefully.\n\nFirst, the context: The guy and his girlfriend moved in together, split rent for a few months, then she couldn't pay. He ended up paying all the rent, and when he asked her to contribute, she said \"why do I have a boyfriend then?\" He then kicked her out. She later said it was a test to see how he'd react in a tough situation, like an accident. The user thinks the author might be wrong but is unsure.\n\nSo, the main points here are financial responsibility in a relationship and mutual contribution. The guy believes he's helping as the guy should pay most, but there should be some give and take. The girl's end of the lease is problematic because she can't pay, leading to his financial strain. \n\nThe user's question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer options are A (Yes) or B (No). \n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, in a relationship, especially when living together, splitting costs is usually expected. If one partner can't contribute, it's a problem. The guy might be right to set boundaries. On the other hand, breaking up and evicting someone over unpaid rent could be harsh, especially if there's a lack of communication or support.\n\nThe girl's attitude that \"why do I have a boyfriend then?\" suggests she sees the relationship as a financial crutch, which is problematic. The author might be justified in wanting to end the relationship due to financial irresponsibility. However, kicking her out immediately without trying to find a solution could be seen as abrupt. But given the circumstances, maybe it's a necessary step for his own financial health.\n\nAlso, the fact that she considered it a \"test\" might indicate manipulative behavior, which the author correctly recognized as a red flag. So, the author's decision to end the relationship might be a responsible choice rather than being in the wrong.\n"
