We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting upset with his girlfriend over her not wanting to go out when she's on her period. The situation is that he planned a special date, she canceled due to her period, and he made a comment comparing her to other women he's known who don't act that way. She then had a strong emotional reaction.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author's girlfriend has a history of not feeling well during her period, canceling plans. He had planned a date weeks in advance, and she knew about it. On that day, she decided to cancel, and he expressed frustration, which led to an argument.\n\nThe author's main issue is that he feels she should put in more effort, even when on her period. But from a relationship perspective, communication and empathy are crucial. The girlfriend's reaction was intense, which might indicate that the comment hurt her feelings. Comparing her to other women he's known could be perceived as invalidating her experience. Even if he wasn't angry, the passive-aggressive remark might have crossed a line.\n\nAlso, periods can be really tough, with pain and discomfort. It's not about effort but about how she's feeling physically. The author might not have considered how his words would come off as dismissive of her pain. He had planned something special, but flexibility and understanding are important in relationships. The fact that she locked herself in her room and they haven't spoken since shows the impact of his words.\n\nHe should have approached the situation with more empathy. Instead of making a comparison, maybe he could have expressed his disappointment and offered to adjust the plans. The root of the problem is his lack of understanding of her physical condition and how his comment made her feel unappreciated or criticized.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author is likely in the wrong because his comment was hurtful and dismissive of her legitimate health issue. He should have been more supportive and found a way to accommodate her needs rather than expressing frustration in a way that invalidated her feelings.\n"
