We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about the girlfriend not wanting to go out when she's on her period, and the author expressing that he's upset because she cancels plans. Then, after a specific incident where he made a comment comparing her to other women he's lived with, she got extremely upset.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author's main argument is that he's not in the wrong because he's frustrated with her canceling plans during her period. He mentions that he knows women get cramps, so he's putting up with it up to a point. However, in this specific case, he had a planned date night, and she canceled. He told her he's seen other women put in more effort, which led to a big argument.\n\nNow, the girlfriend's reaction was intense\u2014calling him names, crying, and locking herself in her room. The author is confused because he didn't mean to be harsh, just a bit passive-aggressive. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nLooking at the dynamics, the author's comment about other women he's lived with implies judgment or comparison. Even if he wasn't angry, making such a comparison can be hurtful. It's true that periods can cause physical discomfort, and everyone experiences it differently. However, the author's approach was to compare her behavior to others, which might undermine her feelings.\n\nThe key here is communication. The author's frustration is valid, but the way he expressed it was problematic. Comparing partners to others is a common relationship no-no because it can make the other person feel undervalued. The girlfriend's reaction suggests that the comment hurt her deeply, leading her to feel criticized and devalued. Even if the author thought he was being reasonable, the method of communication was disrespectful.\n\nAlso, the fact that they had planned the date weeks in advance and she knew about it, yet she still canceled, might be a point the author is emphasizing. However, the girlfriend's period is a valid reason for her to cancel, and the author's response was not empathetic. Instead of acknowledging her discomfort and adjusting plans collaboratively, he made a passive-aggressive comment that triggered her emotionally.\n\nIn relationships, it's important to validate each other's feelings. The author's approach here didn't show empathy but instead implied that her feelings weren't as important as his plans. The girlfriend's anger and emotional response indicate that she felt attacked, which is a common reaction when someone feels judged or compared unfavorably to others.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's mistake was in his communication method. Even if his frustration was understandable, the way he expressed it was hurtful and dismissive of her needs. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong.\n"
