We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a girlfriend who cancels plans when she's on her period, and the author gets upset because he thinks other women don't act like that. Then he comments on that, which causes her to have a huge reaction.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The girl has periods that affect her for the first two days, making her not want to go out. The author planned a special date night, but she canceled. He expressed frustration by saying other women he's known don't act like that, implying she's not making enough effort. She was upset and reacted strongly. \n\nFrom a relationship perspective, communication is key. The author planned something weeks in advance, and she knew about it. However, she had her period that day and couldn't go. The author's comment about other women could be seen as invalidating her feelings. Even if he wasn't angry, the passive-aggressive remark might have hurt her. \n\nPeriods are a natural part of life and can cause physical discomfort. Expecting someone to go out despite being in pain might be unreasonable. The author's frustration is understandable, but his approach was dismissive of her experience. Comparing her to other women might make her feel judged or misunderstood. \n\nOn the other hand, the author had invested time and effort into the plans. It's possible he felt disrespected when the plans were canceled. However, the way he expressed his feelings was probably not the best approach. Instead of comparing to others, he could have tried to understand her situation better or found an alternative plan. \n\nSo, the main issue here is the author's comment about other women. That's likely what triggered her strong reaction. He didn't validate her experience and instead implied she should be able to handle it better. In relationships, supporting each other's needs is important. The author's reaction, while stemming from frustration, was probably not supportive. Therefore, he's in the wrong for invalidating her feelings.\n"
