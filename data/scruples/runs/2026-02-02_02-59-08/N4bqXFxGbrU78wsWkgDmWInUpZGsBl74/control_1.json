We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about the author getting upset with his girlfriend because she cancels plans when she's on her period. He planned a special date, she canceled because she was on her period, and he made a comment comparing her to other women he's known, which led to a big argument.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The girlfriend has been staying home during her period, which the author is okay with usually. The problem here is that he planned a special evening, she canceled, and he expressed frustration by comparing her to other women. The girlfriend then had a strong negative reaction.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, even if he's not angry, making a passive-aggressive comment about other women not acting like this could be hurtful. It's possible he's not considering how that comparison might feel to her. It's important to acknowledge that everyone has different ways of dealing with period symptoms. Maybe she has more severe cramps, or this is her way of coping. By bringing up other women, he's implying she's not meeting his expectations, which could be dismissive of her feelings and experiences.\n\nAlso, communication is key here. Instead of comparing her to others, maybe he should have expressed his feelings without judgment. The fact that she got so upset, cried, and locked herself in her room shows that his comment really hurt her. Even though he might not have meant to be aggressive, the impact matters. He should probably take responsibility for not handling the situation better and work on understanding her perspective.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might feel that he's being reasonable, expecting some effort for a planned date. But the main issue is how he communicated his feelings. Comparing her to others is a classic way to make someone feel inadequate, which isn't helpful. The right approach would be to validate her feelings and find a compromise, not to criticize her for something beyond her control.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is likely A (Yes, the author is in the wrong). His comment was dismissive and hurtful, even if unintentionally, and he needs to apologize and work on better communication.\n"
