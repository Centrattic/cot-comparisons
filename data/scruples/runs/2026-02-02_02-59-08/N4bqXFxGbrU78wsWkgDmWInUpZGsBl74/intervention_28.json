We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by understanding the situation. The guy is upset because his girlfriend cancels their plans when she's on her period. He had planned a special date night, but she backed out because she was starting her period. He compared her to other women he's lived with, implying they didn't act this way. His girlfriend got extremely upset, called him names, cried, and they haven't talked since.\n\nFirst, I should consider the context. The author mentions that his girlfriend usually cancels plans for the first two days of her period, which is semi-random each month. He's been putting up with it until this one time when he got impatient. The key point here is his comment about other women not acting like that. Even if he wasn't angry, saying something passive-aggressive about how other women handle periods could come off as dismissive of her pain and feelings. \n\nPeriods can cause significant physical discomfort for many women, and it's not a one-size-fits-all situation. What one person can handle, another might not. By bringing up his past experiences with other women, he's suggesting that his current girlfriend's reaction is excessive, which invalidates her experience. That's a major red flag. People's experiences with pain and health issues vary, and comparing them to others can be hurtful and disrespectful. \n\nAlso, the timing of the date night was important. He had planned it weeks in advance, and she knew about it. But when her period started, she felt too unwell to go. The author's frustration is understandable, but the way he expressed it was problematic. Instead of being supportive and finding an alternative plan, he criticized her, which led to a major argument.\n\nAnother angle is communication. The girlfriend's reaction was intense, which might indicate that this is a sensitive issue for her. The author's comment probably touched on a deeper issue where she feels her needs aren't being respected. Even if he didn't mean to be cruel, the statement was dismissive and could make her feel like her pain isn't valid. \n\nIn relationships, empathy and understanding are crucial. The author's approach here lacked both. He should have acknowledged her discomfort and maybe suggested adjusting the plans instead of making a passive-aggressive remark about other women. The fact that she locked herself in her room and they haven't talked since shows how hurt she was. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's comment was the trigger for the conflict. He didn't consider how his words would affect her and instead of showing support, he made her feel like her feelings weren't valid. That makes him at least partially at fault here. Even if he had a valid point about planning ahead, the way he communicated it was harmful. Therefore, the answer is A (he's in the wrong).\n"
