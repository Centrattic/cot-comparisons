We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for getting upset that his girlfriend cancels their plans when she's on her period. \n\nFirst, the context: They've been living together for three months. The girlfriend usually cancels plans for the first two days of her period, which the author puts up with. But this time, they had a special date night with reservations and tickets. The author planned it weeks in advance, and the girlfriend canceled last minute because her period started. The author then made a comment comparing his current girlfriend to other women he's lived with, implying she's worse at handling periods. The girlfriend reacted extremely negatively, leading to a fight.\n\nSo, the key points here are about communication and respect. Even if the author's intention wasn't to be aggressive (he says it wasn't angry, maybe passive-aggressive), bringing up past experiences and comparing partners can be very hurtful. The girlfriend's reaction shows that she felt disrespected. The author had planned something important, but the girlfriend was experiencing physical discomfort. It's a balance between understanding her needs and his feelings about the plans. However, the way the author addressed the issue\u2014by comparing her to others\u2014probably wasn't constructive. It's important to validate her experience rather than imply she's not handling it well. The author's approach might have been dismissive of her pain and needs, even if he tried to be passive-aggressive. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author could have expressed his disappointment without making her feel like she's not good enough. The girlfriend's extreme reaction might be due to feeling criticized for her natural bodily functions. So, the author's comment, while maybe not loud or angry, still crossed a line by invalidating her situation. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong here.\n"
