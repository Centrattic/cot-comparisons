We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is about a guy getting upset with his girlfriend because she cancels their plans when she's on her period. He planned a special date night, but she canceled because she was on her period. He told her that he knows other women who don't act like that, which made her blow up at him. Now, they haven't talked since, and he's wondering if he's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze both sides. The girlfriend has been having periods that make her stay home for the first couple of days. The author mentions she's usually laid back but this is a recurring issue. The key point here is that during her period, she feels unwell and cancels plans. The author planned something in advance, but she couldn't go because of her period. He expressed his frustration by comparing her to other women he's lived with, which upset her.\n\nSo, the main issue here is about communication and understanding. The author's frustration is understandable because he put effort into the plans and had to wait. However, the way he expressed it was passive-aggressive and dismissive of her feelings. By bringing up other women, he's implying that her reaction is excessive, which can come off as invalidating her experience. Periods can be really painful and affect people differently, and comparing her to others doesn't consider her specific situation.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction was intense, but it's possible she felt criticized and not supported. The author didn't approach the situation with empathy. Instead of discussing how to handle future plans together, he made a comparison that hurt her feelings. Even though he wasn't angry, the passive-aggressive comment could have been hurtful. The fact that she locked herself in her room and was crying shows the emotional impact of his words.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author likely said something that was hurtful and didn't validate her experience. He should have communicated his feelings without comparing her to others. Therefore, the answer would be that he is in the wrong.\n"
