We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for getting upset with his girlfriend because she doesn't want to go out when she's on her period. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The girlfriend is described as generally kind and laid-back. The main issue is that during her period, especially the first two days, she doesn't want to do anything. The author has been putting up with it until one instance where he planned a special date. She canceled because her period started that day, and he expressed his frustration by comparing her to other women he's lived with who don't act this way. That led to her blowing up at him.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author planned a special date knowing her period was coming, but she canceled. He then made a passive-aggressive comment implying she's not trying hard enough compared to other women. She had a strong negative reaction, leading to a conflict.\n\nNow, considering common perspectives. Periods can be physically and emotionally challenging for some women. Cramps, fatigue, mood swings are real issues. The author acknowledges that he knows \"girls get cramps and shit during shark week,\" which is a bit of a dismissive way to refer to periods, but he seems to accept that it's a normal thing. However, in this case, he's upset that she's canceling plans despite knowing about the plans weeks in advance.\n\nThe problem arises when he compares her to other women he's known. Even if he's not angry, saying that others don't act this way implies that her reaction is somehow atypical or that she's not making an effort. This could come off as invalidating her experience. It's possible that she's dealing with more severe symptoms, or maybe she's sensitive about her period being a topic of comparison. \n\nAlso, the fact that she locked herself in her room and cried suggests that the comment really hurt her. It's important to consider that even if the author didn't mean it harshly, his words were hurtful. Comparing one's partner to others can be a sensitive issue, especially when it's about health or bodily experiences.\n\nOn the other hand, the author did plan a special date, which he invested time and effort into. He might feel frustrated that his plans are being canceled. However, the way he expressed his frustration was by bringing up other women, which might not be helpful. He could have approached it differently, maybe by discussing his feelings without making comparisons.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The author's main mistake was comparing his girlfriend to other women instead of being empathetic. Even if he was feeling upset about the canceled plans, the way he expressed his feelings was hurtful. The girlfriend's reaction is a sign that the comment was damaging. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong here because he didn't communicate his feelings in a constructive way and invalidated her experience.\n"
