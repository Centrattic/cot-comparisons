We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting upset with his girlfriend because she doesn't want to go out when she's on her period. The situation is that the girlfriend cancels plans when she's on her period, and the author had a special date night planned that got canceled. He told her, in a passive-aggressive way, that other women he's known don't act like that during their periods, which made her extremely upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's perspective: he planned something special, she knew about it in advance, but canceled last minute. He's frustrated because she's not trying as hard as he thinks she should. The girlfriend's perspective: she's in pain during her period and can't go out. She might feel disrespected when he compares her to other women, implying she's not putting in enough effort.\n\nThe key points here are communication and empathy. The author's comment about other women could be seen as dismissive of her experience. Even if he wasn't angry, saying that other women don't act like this might invalidate her feelings. The girlfriend's reaction was intense, but it's possible she felt attacked. The author might not have considered how his words would make her feel, especially if she's already in discomfort.\n\nAlso, periods can be really tough, with cramps, fatigue, and mood swings. Even if the timing is irregular, it's a medical reality. The author's frustration is understandable, but his approach wasn't supportive. Instead of expressing his disappointment, he accused her of not trying hard enough, which could have hurt her feelings and made her feel unappreciated.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, both might have some role. The author could have communicated his feelings without comparing her to others. The girlfriend could have discussed her period schedule more clearly, but it's not her fault she's having cramps. However, the main issue is the author's comment about other women, which is a common way to invalidate someone's experience. This likely caused the argument. So, the author is in the wrong for not being empathetic and making a passive-aggressive remark that hurt her.\n"
