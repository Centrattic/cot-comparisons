We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is that the author got upset with his girlfriend because she cancels their plans when she's on her period. He had a special date night planned, but she canceled, and when he made a comment comparing her to other women he's lived with, she got extremely upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The girlfriend is dealing with period cramps and other symptoms, which can be really painful and make someone feel unwell. It's common for people to feel like they need rest during that time. The author acknowledges that she's usually laid back and nice, but this situation is causing conflict.\n\nThe author's main point is that he's upset because she cancels plans, and he expressed that he thinks other women he's known don't act this way. The problem here is that he made a comparison to other women, which can be really hurtful. Even if he didn't mean it to be harsh, bringing up other women in a relationship is a classic way to make someone feel insecure or not good enough. That probably triggered her emotional response because it invalidated her feelings and experiences.\n\nAdditionally, the author had planned something weeks in advance, and she knew about it. But her period started unexpectedly. Even though he knew it could be random, he still went ahead with the plan. The key here is empathy. She's dealing with physical discomfort, and his reaction wasn't understanding but rather making a judgment. That's where the issue lies. The author didn't validate her need to take care of herself but instead criticized her for it.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction was intense, but it's understandable given the comment. People can have strong reactions when they feel criticized or compared unfavorably. The author's passive-aggressive remark about other women could have made her feel like her feelings aren't valid or that she's being lazy. That's a common trigger in relationships.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's mistake was not expressing his feelings in a supportive way. He should have acknowledged her situation and perhaps discussed alternatives rather than making a comparison. The core issue is lack of empathy and poor communication. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
