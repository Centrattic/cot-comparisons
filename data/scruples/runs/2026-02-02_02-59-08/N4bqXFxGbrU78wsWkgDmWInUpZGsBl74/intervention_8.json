We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a girlfriend who doesn't want to go out when she's on her period, and the author got upset about it.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the context. The girlfriend is usually laid back and nice, but during her period, she cancels plans and stays home. The author planned a special date night that she canceled because her period started that day. The author then made a comment comparing her to other women he's lived with, implying she's not trying hard enough. This led to her having a strong emotional reaction, yelling, crying, and not talking to him since.\n\nSo, the key points here are the author's reaction and the girlfriend's response. The author planned something special and she canceled, which is understandable due to her period. But he expressed frustration, even if not angrily, by saying other women don't act this way. That seems like it could be dismissive of her experience. Periods can be really painful for some people, and it's not fair to compare her to others. The author's comment about other women might come off as invalidating her feelings and physical state. \n\nEven if he's not angry, making a passive-aggressive remark about how other women handle their periods can be hurtful. It's important to acknowledge that period experiences vary, and what might be manageable for some could be debilitating for others. The girlfriend's reaction, while intense, might stem from feeling disrespected or not supported. The author didn't consider her perspective and instead used a comparison that she found offensive. \n\nSo, in relationships, communication and empathy are key. The author's statement could be seen as minimizing her legitimate discomfort. Therefore, he's in the wrong for not being considerate and for making a comparison that hurt her feelings.\n"
