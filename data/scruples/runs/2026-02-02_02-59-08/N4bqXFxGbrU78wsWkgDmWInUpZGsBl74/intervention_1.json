We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. The author's girlfriend cancels plans when she's on her period, and he got upset when she canceled a special date night they had planned weeks in advance. He compared her to other women he's known who didn't act that way, and that's what triggered her anger.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author acknowledges that his girlfriend is great and usually laid back. He understands that periods can be tough, but this specific instance with the planned date caused frustration. He made a passive-aggressive comment about other women, which upset her a lot.\n\nThe main issue here is communication and respect. Even if the author is frustrated, comparing his partner to others is a common way to invalidate her feelings. Saying other women don't act that way implies that his girlfriend is overreacting or not trying hard enough. That's not supportive. He should have expressed his feelings without minimizing her experience. The fact that she was in pain and canceled the plans is valid, and he should have been more understanding. His comment likely came off as dismissive, which is why she reacted so strongly. So, the author is in the wrong because he didn't respect her feelings and needs during her period, even if he was trying to communicate his own dissatisfaction. The answer should be A.\n"
