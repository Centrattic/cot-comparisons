We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a girlfriend who doesn't want to go out when she's on her period, and the author got upset because she canceled their planned date. The key points here are communication, expectations, and empathy.\n\nFirst, the author planned a special date in advance and the girlfriend canceled because she was on her period. The author mentioned that he knows other women who don't act this way. But he also said he usually puts up with her not going out during her period. The problem here is that even though he had plans, he might have assumed that she could make an exception for a special date, but maybe she was in more pain than usual or felt it was too much. \n\nThe main issue is the way the author communicated his frustration. He used a passive-aggressive comment comparing his previous experiences with other women. That's a classic way to make someone feel defensive. Even if he wasn't angry, bringing up other women can be hurtful. The girlfriend's reaction was intense, which suggests that the comment hit a nerve. She might have felt criticized or not supported during her time of discomfort.\n\nAlso, the author might not fully understand the severity of her period symptoms. He mentions she cancels everything for the first two days, and her period is irregular. It's possible that on this day, she was having a particularly bad time, and the date was an added stress. The author's lack of consideration for her physical state on that specific day, despite knowing her history, could be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nEven though he had a plan, the girlfriend's health and comfort might take precedence. The author should have been more understanding and perhaps offered alternatives instead of expressing frustration. The fact that she locked herself in her room and they haven't communicated since shows the impact of his words. He needs to take responsibility for the way he phrased his concerns instead of focusing on his own plans.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author's approach was dismissive of her feelings. Instead of being supportive, he compared her to others, which is a common mistake. He should have acknowledged her pain and maybe adjusted the plans in a way that works for both, like rescheduling or doing something less strenuous. So, yes, the author is in the wrong because his reaction was insensitive and didn't consider her perspective adequately.\n"
