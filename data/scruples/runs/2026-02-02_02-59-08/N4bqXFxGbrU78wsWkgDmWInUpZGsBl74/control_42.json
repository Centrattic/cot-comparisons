We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author getting upset with his girlfriend for canceling plans when she's on her period. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points of the scenario. The girlfriend experiences severe period symptoms that make her stay home, even canceling plans she knew about weeks in advance. The author planned a special date night, but she backed out. He expressed his frustration by comparing her to other women he's known who don't act this way, which led to a major argument.\n\nNow, I should think about period-related issues. It's well-known that some women experience heavy cramps, pain, or other symptoms during their periods. However, the girlfriend's reaction of canceling all activities, even when she was aware of the plans, might be extreme. The author's frustration is understandable because he put in effort to plan something special.\n\nBut the main issue here is how the author communicated his feelings. Instead of expressing his disappointment constructively, he used a passive-aggressive comment about other women. That's a problematic approach because it can come off as dismissive and invalidating. Comparing her to others he's known might make her feel unappreciated or criticized, especially during a time when she's already feeling unwell.\n\nThe girlfriend's intense reaction\u2014crying, anger, and withdrawing\u2014suggests that his comment deeply hurt her. Even if her symptoms are real, the way he addressed his feelings was hurtful. The author could have tried to understand her situation better, perhaps by asking how he could support her instead of making a comparison that implies she's not trying hard enough.\n\nSo, while the girlfriend's behavior might be challenging, the author's response was inconsiderate. He should have approached the situation with empathy rather than making a judgmental remark. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
