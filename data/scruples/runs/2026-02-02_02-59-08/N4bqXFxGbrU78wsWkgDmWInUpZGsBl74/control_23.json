We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting upset with his girlfriend when she cancels their date night because she's on her period.\n\nFirst, the author planned a special date weeks in advance, and the girlfriend knew about it. But when her period started that day, she canceled. The author told her that he's been with other women who didn't act like this, implying she should put more effort. The girlfriend had a strong negative reaction, leading to a conflict.\n\nSo, the key points here: The author's complaint is about his girlfriend canceling plans due to her period. He's comparing her behavior to other women he's been with, suggesting she's being more extreme. \n\nI need to consider if his reaction was appropriate. Even if he was trying to be passive-aggressive, bringing up other women in a negative light might be hurtful. It's possible that the girlfriend felt criticized for something beyond her control, like period pain. \n\nAlso, period cramps are real and can be very debilitating. If the girlfriend is staying home, it's not just about being lazy but dealing with physical discomfort. The author might not be acknowledging her pain. \n\nComparing her to other women he's dated could be dismissive of her experience. Everyone's body is different, and maybe those other women didn't have as severe cramps. The author's comment might come off as invalidating her feelings and health.\n\nEven if the author was just trying to express frustration, the way he did it was probably not the right approach. The girlfriend's strong reaction shows how much it hurt her, leading to a breakdown in communication. \n\nIn relationships, it's important to support each other through health issues. The author should have been more understanding and maybe tried to find an alternative plan instead of expressing frustration. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author likely overstepped by making a comparison to other women and not empathizing with her situation. That's why the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
