We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for getting upset with his girlfriend over her period-related cancellations.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend's behavior: she cancels plans for the first two days of her period, doesn't want to do anything, and it's causing the author to plan around unpredictable times. The author mentions he's tried to be understanding but had a specific date night that got canceled, leading to a confrontation where he made a passive-aggressive comment comparing her to other women he's known. His girlfriend reacted extremely negatively, leading to a breakdown in communication.\n\nThe key points here are the author's comment. He said that other women he's lived with don't act this way, implying she's being more severe than average. Even though he wasn't angry, his comparison might have come off as dismissive or invalidating of her experience. \n\nPeriods can be really tough, with cramps, fatigue, and mood swings. The girlfriend's response suggests that she felt disrespected by his comment. Comparing her to other women could make her feel like her pain isn't legitimate, which is a common issue in relationships. \n\nThe author's intention was maybe to express frustration, but the way he delivered it was hurtful. The girlfriend's reaction (crying, yelling) shows how much the comment affected her. It's important to validate a partner's feelings, especially during times when they're already vulnerable. \n\nEven if the author is trying to be reasonable about planning, he should have approached the conversation with more empathy. Instead of comparing her to others, he could have discussed how to manage future plans together. The fact that the girlfriend locked herself in her room and they haven't talked since indicates a serious breach in communication. \n\nIn relationships, it's crucial to support each other's needs. The author's comment, while not yelling, was passive-aggressive and potentially hurtful. The girlfriend's extreme reaction might be due to past sensitivities or feeling invalidated. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author did make a mistake by making that comparison. It's not the content of the message (planning around periods is a valid concern) but the delivery and lack of empathy that caused the issue. Therefore, the answer leans towards the author being in the wrong.\n"
