We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) question is in the wrong. The situation is about the author being upset with his girlfriend for not wanting to go out when she's on her period. He planned a special date night, but she canceled because her period started, and he made a comment about other women not acting like that. She got really upset, yelled at him, and they haven't talked since.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points here. The author's main issue is that his girlfriend cancels plans during her period, and he feels she's not putting in enough effort. He compares her behavior to other women he's known, implying she's being more extreme than necessary. The girlfriend's reaction was intense, which makes him question if he was wrong.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Well, periods can be really uncomfortable, and cramps can vary in severity from person to person. Even though the author acknowledges that women get cramps, he's planning a date night that requires her to go out when she's not feeling well. The fact that her period arrives unpredictably adds to the problem. But the key here is his comment about other women not acting like that. Comparing his girlfriend to others is a classic mistake in relationships. It can come across as dismissive of her feelings and experiences. Even if he didn't mean it angrily, saying that others don't act this way implies he thinks she's overreacting, which can be hurtful.\n\nAlso, the girlfriend's reaction was severe. She didn't just get upset but had a major meltdown. That suggests she felt disrespected or misunderstood. The author's comment might have made her feel like her pain wasn't valid. Even if she sometimes cancels, the way he framed it could have been triggering. The fact that he had planned the date weeks in advance and she knew about it, but her period came anyway, might not be her fault. The unpredictability of periods isn't something either of them can control.\n\nSo, the author's mistake was in how he communicated his feelings. Instead of expressing his disappointment constructively, he made a comparison that undermined her experience. Even if he's frustrated, blaming her by comparing her to others is not healthy. The girlfriend's emotional response indicates that his words hurt her deeply. Therefore, he's in the wrong here for not being supportive and for making her feel like her needs were lesser compared to others.\n"
