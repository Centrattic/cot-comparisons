We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong after getting upset with his girlfriend for canceling plans when she's on her period.\n\nFirst, the author planned a special date night that his girlfriend canceled because she was on her period. He got upset and made a comment comparing her to other women he's lived with, implying she should be able to handle it better. His girlfriend reacted strongly, calling him names and crying.\n\nNow, considering the situation, the author's main issue is frustration about the cancellation. But his approach was to make a passive-aggressive comment about other women not acting the same way. That's a problem because it's a comparison that can come off as dismissive of her feelings and experiences. Even if he wasn't angry, the remark was likely hurtful and invalidated her pain.\n\nThe girlfriend has a valid reason for canceling\u2014period cramps can be really debilitating for some people. The author could have been more understanding and maybe offered to adjust plans instead of getting upset. By bringing up other women, he's not addressing her specific situation but using a comparison that's not helpful.\n\nAlso, the fact that she locked herself in her room and they haven't talked since suggests the conflict is significant. The author needs to take responsibility for his part in escalating the situation. His comment was a trigger, so he's at least partially at fault.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. Instead of comparing her to others, he should have expressed his feelings without making her feel blamed. The girlfriend's reaction, while intense, might be a result of feeling misunderstood or criticized. The author's approach was flawed because it didn't show empathy or understanding for her condition.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's comment was inconsiderate and contributed to the conflict. He's in the wrong because he didn't validate her feelings and made a harmful comparison. Answer A makes sense here.\n"
