We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author being upset because his girlfriend cancels their plans when she's on her period. He compares her behavior to other women he's lived with, who didn't act that way, and she reacted very negatively.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points here. The author is frustrated because his girlfriend is not going out when she's on her period. He planned a special date night, which she canceled. He mentioned that he told her he knows other women who don't act like that, implying she could put in more effort. She then exploded and they haven't talked since. The question is whether he's wrong for reacting that way.\n\nFrom a relationship perspective, communication is key. The author's frustration is valid\u2014having plans canceled after planning weeks in advance can be frustrating. However, the way he expressed his frustration is important. He used passive-aggressive comments comparing her to other women, which can be hurtful. Comparing partners to others is often a no-no in relationships because it can make the other person feel inadequate or not understood.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction was intense, which might indicate that the author's comments struck a nerve. She might feel that he's minimizing her pain or that he's not empathetic. Period pain can be severe for some people, and canceling plans might be a necessary choice for self-care. The author's statement about other women not acting that way could be seen as dismissive of her experience, even if it's true in his past. Everyone's pain threshold and experience with periods can be different.\n\nAlso, the author's approach of making a comparison might have come across as insensitivity. Even if his intention was to express his feelings, the method might have been inconsiderate. In a healthy relationship, both partners should support each other's needs without making the other feel criticized. The author's frustration is understandable, but his approach was flawed because it didn't account for his girlfriend's feelings and perspective.\n\nAnother angle is that the author may not have considered the physical and emotional discomfort his girlfriend is experiencing. Even if she's usually laid back, her period days might be times when she feels unusually unwell. The author's comment about other women not acting that way might overlook the fact that his current partner's experience is different, and that's okay. Each person's experience with their body is unique.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's frustration is somewhat relatable, his handling of the situation was inappropriate. Comparing his partner to others and implying she could do more is likely what caused the argument. He should have addressed his feelings without making her feel judged. Therefore, he's in the wrong.\n"
