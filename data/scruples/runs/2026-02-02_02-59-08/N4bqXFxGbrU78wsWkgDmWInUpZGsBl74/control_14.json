We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again to make sure I understand it.\n\nThe author's girlfriend doesn't like going out when she's on her period, especially the first two days. She cancels plans and stays home, even if they have things planned. The author usually puts up with it, but this time they had a special date night with dinner and a movie. They had planned it weeks in advance, and the girlfriend knew about it. On the day, she started her period and wanted to cancel. The author told her, in a not angry but maybe passive-aggressive way, that other women he's lived with don't act this way and that she could put in more effort. The girlfriend then had a huge reaction, called him names, cried, and they haven't talked since. The author is upset and asking if he's in the wrong.\n\nHmm. So the key points here are communication and empathy. The author is frustrated because the girlfriend is canceling plans, and he's comparing her behavior to other women he's known. The girlfriend's reaction was intense, which suggests that maybe his words were hurtful or she felt criticized. \n\nFirst, even if the author is feeling let down by the canceled plans, his comment about other women might come across as dismissive of her pain. Comparing her to others isn't helpful, and could make her feel like her experience isn't valid. It's important to validate her feelings rather than minimize them. \n\nAlso, he mentions that her period comes at a random time each month. If that's the case, maybe there's a communication issue about tracking her cycle better so they can plan around it. But the author's response was to express frustration in a way that might have made her feel unappreciated or undervalued. \n\nEven if the author had planned the date, the girlfriend's health and comfort are important. It's possible that the author didn't consider that her discomfort might be more severe than he's experienced with others, or that she might feel pressured to go despite not feeling well. \n\nPassive-aggressive comments can escalate situations. Even if not said angrily, they can be perceived as sarcastic or condescending. The girlfriend's emotional response indicates that the comment hit a nerve. The author might need to take responsibility for how his words were received, even if his intention was to express his feelings about the situation.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author might have been in the wrong for not being more empathetic and for making a comparison that could be seen as a criticism of his partner's behavior. The girlfriend's reaction, while intense, might be a response to feeling criticized, which could have been avoided with a different approach to communication.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's actions were probably inconsiderate and lacking in empathy. He should have addressed his feelings in a way that validates her experience rather than comparing her to others. Therefore, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
