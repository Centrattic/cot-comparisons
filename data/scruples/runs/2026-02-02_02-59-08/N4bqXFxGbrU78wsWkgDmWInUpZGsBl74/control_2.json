We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a girlfriend not wanting to go out when she's on her period, and the author gets upset because she canceled their planned date night.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The girlfriend has cramps and isn't feeling well, which is a common issue during menstruation. The author planned a special date weeks in advance, which the girlfriend knew about. She canceled last minute when her period started. The author's response was to compare her to other women he's known and suggest she should put in more effort. That led to a big argument where the girlfriend was really upset.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the girlfriend's health and well-being versus the author's expectations and plans. The author might not fully understand the severity of her period cramps, maybe downplaying them by saying \"girls get cramps and shit during shark week\"\u2014wait, shark week? That's probably a typo, maybe \"their period week\" or something else. Maybe the user meant \"their period week\" and it's a typo. Either way, the author's comment about other women not acting this way is problematic. It implies that his girlfriend is being more dramatic than others, which could be dismissive of her actual pain and needs.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction was intense\u2014she called him names and cried. That suggests she felt hurt or disrespected. The author's comment about other women might have made her feel like her pain wasn't valid. Even if the author's intention wasn't to be angry, making that comparison could be seen as belittling her experience. \n\nSo, in terms of responsibility, the author might be in the wrong because he didn't consider that his girlfriend might have valid reasons for not going out, and his response was dismissive. The girlfriend had the right to prioritize her health, and the author's reaction was about his plans not being respected. However, the girlfriend also could have communicated better. But the main issue here is the author's response. He should have been more empathetic and understanding rather than comparing her to others. \n\nThe key is that the author's comment about other women not acting this way, even if said passively, likely hurt her feelings and invalidated her experience. So yes, he's in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
