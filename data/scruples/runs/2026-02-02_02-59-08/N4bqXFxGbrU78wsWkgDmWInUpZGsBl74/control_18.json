We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is about a girlfriend who cancels plans when she's on her period, and the author compares her to other women he's known, implying she could do better.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the author's actions. He planned a date night, knew she had her period around that time, but she canceled. He told her that other women he's known don't act like this and she should put in more effort. That's where the conflict started.\n\nThe key points here are communication and empathy. The author might not realize that period symptoms vary, and comparing his partner to others is hurtful. Even if he's not angry, saying she's worse than others can feel like a criticism. She reacted strongly, which shows she felt disrespected or invalidated.\n\nHe could have approached it by asking how she's feeling, offering help, or trying to adjust plans together. Instead, he made a comparison, which might have made her feel like her needs weren't being considered. The fact that she locked herself in her room and they haven't talked since suggests the issue is serious.\n\nSo, while he might not have intended to be cruel, the way he communicated his frustration was likely the problem. The author is in the wrong because he didn't show empathy and made a comparison that could be seen as belittling her experience.\n"
