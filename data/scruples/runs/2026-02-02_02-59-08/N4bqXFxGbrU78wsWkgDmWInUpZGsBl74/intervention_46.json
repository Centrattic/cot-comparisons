We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for getting upset with his girlfriend because she doesn't want to go out when she's on her period. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple has been living together for three months. The girlfriend is normally great, but during her period, especially the first two days, she cancels plans and stays home. The author usually puts up with it, but one time he planned a special date night, which she canceled because her period started that day. He told her, in a passive-aggressive way, that other women he's known don't act like this, implying she should make more effort for him. She exploded, called him names, cried, and they haven't talked since.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. The options are A (yes, he's wrong) or B (no).\n\nBreaking it down: The key points are the girl's physical and emotional state during her period, the author's expectation that she should ignore her discomfort for their plans, and how he communicated his frustration. \n\nPremenstrual symptoms can be severe, including cramps, fatigue, nausea, etc. It's a medical reality that periods can affect women differently each month, which is why the girl's periods are described as coming at semi-random times. The author planned the date knowing about her cycle in advance, but maybe she couldn't have predicted the timing. \n\nThe author's comment about other women he's known might come off as dismissive of her experience. Comparing her to others in a negative way can be hurtful. Even if he wasn't angry, the passive-aggressive remark might have invalidated her feelings. \n\nCommunication is crucial in relationships. The author could have expressed his feelings without belittling her. Instead, he used a comparison that likely made her feel unappreciated. Her reaction, while intense, might stem from feeling disrespected or not being considered. \n\nSo, the author's actions\u2014making a judgmental comment about her behavior compared to others\u2014might have been the catalyst for the argument. He could have handled it by checking in with her, perhaps adjusting plans, or showing empathy. Therefore, the responsibility lies more on him for how he communicated his frustration rather than the situation itself. \n\nI think the answer is A, the author is in the wrong because he didn't approach the situation with sufficient empathy and made a hurtful comparison.\n"
