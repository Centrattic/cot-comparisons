We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for getting upset with his girlfriend because she doesn't want to go out when she's on her period. The situation involves a conflict where the author planned a special date night, but his girlfriend canceled because she was on her period. He expressed frustration by comparing her to other women he's known, which led to a major blowup.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend cancels plans when she's on her period, which the author finds frustrating because it's unpredictable. He tried to be understanding before, but this time he snapped. He made a comment about other women not acting that way, which was passive-aggressive. The key here is whether his reaction was justified or if he overstepped.\n\nFrom a relationship perspective, periods can cause physical discomfort and emotional sensitivity. It's not uncommon for people to feel less like socializing. However, the author had planned the date weeks in advance, and she was aware of it. That shows he made an effort, which is commendable. But his response was to compare her to other women, which can come off as dismissive of her feelings and needs. Comparisons like that can be hurtful and imply that her experience isn't valid compared to others'. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction\u2014losing her temper and crying\u2014suggests that his comment hurt her deeply. It's possible she felt invalidated or judged, especially since she was already in a vulnerable state due to her period. The fact that they haven't communicated since shows the severity of the situation. The author's passive-aggressive comment, even if not shouted, could have been a trigger because it undermined her experience.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. He did plan the date, which shows he cares. But his approach to addressing her behavior was inappropriate. Instead of expressing his feelings without judgment, he used a comparison that likely made her feel criticized. The right approach would have been to express his feelings without blaming her, maybe discussing how to handle these situations together in a way that respects her needs and his efforts.\n\nSo, while the author might have valid feelings about the unpredictability and the effort he put into the date, his method of addressing it was flawed. The answer would be that he's in the wrong because his comment was hurtful and dismissive, leading to a significant argument. He should take responsibility and work on communicating more empathetically.\n"
