We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by breaking down the situation. The user is asking if it's appropriate to be upset with his girlfriend because she doesn't want to go out when she's on her period. From the context, they've been living together for three months, and she's generally laid back and nice, but she cancels plans when she's on her period, especially the first two days. The author mentions that he usually puts up with it, but there was a specific instance where he planned a special date night. She ended up having her period that day and canceled, leading to an argument.\n\nThe key points here are communication, expectations, and empathy. The author planned something special weeks in advance, and she knew about it. But when her period started, she decided to cancel. The author expressed his frustration by comparing her to other women he's lived with, implying that she's not trying hard enough. This made her extremely upset, leading to an emotional outburst.\n\nFirst, the author's approach to the situation might be the issue. Even though he wasn't angry, his comment about other women could be seen as dismissive of her feelings and physical discomfort. Saying that other women don't act that way during their periods could invalidate her experience. Period cramps can be really severe for some people, and it's not just about being lazy or not trying. The author might not fully understand the physical and emotional toll it takes on her.\n\nAlso, the planning aspect is important. He had put effort into scheduling dinner and a movie, expecting her to go through with it even if she was feeling unwell. But when her period starts, it's not something she can control or predict accurately, especially if it's irregular. His frustration might be because he wanted to spend time together, but he didn't account for her health needs. \n\nAnother angle is communication. If the author was feeling let down, maybe he should have approached it without comparing her to others. Instead of saying others don't act like that, he could have expressed that he understands but was disappointed. The way he phrased his frustration came across as judgmental, which likely hurt her feelings and led to her emotional response.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction was intense, but it's possible she was holding in frustration about previous instances where she canceled plans. The argument might have been a culmination of unaddressed issues. The author's comment might have been the last straw for her.\n\nIn relationships, it's crucial to be empathetic and supportive, especially regarding health issues. The author's approach here lacked empathy, focusing on his own expectations rather than her well-being. Even though he had planned something nice, forcing someone to go out when they're in pain isn't fair. However, there's also a balance between supporting each other and maintaining personal needs. The author's mistake was in the way he communicated his feelings, which didn't consider her experience.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The author is in the wrong because he didn't show enough empathy and used a comparative statement that invalidated her feelings. The right approach would have been to express disappointment while supporting her decision to rest. Therefore, the answer should be A.\n"
