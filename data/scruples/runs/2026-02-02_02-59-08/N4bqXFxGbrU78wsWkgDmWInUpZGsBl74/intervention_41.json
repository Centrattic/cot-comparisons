We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author getting upset with his girlfriend because she cancels plans when she's on her period. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points from the post. The girlfriend doesn't want to go out during her period, especially the first two days. She cancels plans, and the author usually tolerates this. However, there was a specific instance where they had a planned date night (dinner and movie) that she canceled because her period started that day. The author, in a non-angry but maybe passive-aggressive way, told her that other women he's known don't act like this, implying she should put in more effort for him. This led to a huge argument, and the girlfriend was very upset.\n\nNow, considering the context: the girlfriend is described as usually kind and laid-back, but this period-related behavior is a recurring issue. The author had made plans weeks in advance, and the girlfriend knew about them. However, her period started that day, and she wanted to stay home. The author's comment about other women seems to be the trigger. \n\nFrom a relationship perspective, even if the author's intention wasn't to be harsh, comparing his girlfriend to others can come off as dismissive of her feelings and experiences. Periods can be very painful for some women, and expecting them to push through the discomfort might not be reasonable. The fact that the girlfriend had a strong emotional reaction suggests that the author's words were hurtful. \n\nIt's important to consider that everyone's pain threshold and experience with periods vary. The author's past experiences with other women don't necessarily apply here. By suggesting she should act differently, he might be invalidating her physical and emotional state. The passive-aggressive comment likely made her feel criticized, leading to her outburst. \n\nIn terms of communication, the author could have approached the situation with more empathy, perhaps discussing how to handle future plans rather than making a comparative remark. The fact that they haven't talked since indicates a breakdown in communication, which is often the result of such comments. \n\nSo, while the author's intention might not have been malicious, the way he expressed his frustration (by comparing his girlfriend to others) was likely the main issue. The girlfriend's reaction, though intense, is a sign that the author's words crossed a line. Therefore, the author is probably in the wrong here.\n"
