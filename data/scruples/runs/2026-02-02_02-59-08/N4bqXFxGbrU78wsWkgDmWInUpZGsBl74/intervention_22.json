We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the person got upset with their girlfriend because she cancels plans when she's on her period. The key points here are about communication, expectations, and understanding.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend is described as someone who doesn't want to do anything for the first two days of her period. The author mentions that he's usually okay with this, but there was a specific instance where he planned a special date night, and she canceled. He then made a comment comparing her to other women he's lived with who don't act this way, which led to her blowing up at him.\n\nSo, the main issue here seems to be the author's comment. He said that other women he's known don't act like this even when on their period, implying she's making a big deal out of nothing. Even though he said it passively-aggressively, not angrily, it clearly hurt her. Periods can cause significant pain and discomfort for some women, and while others might handle it differently, it's not fair to compare. Each person's experience is unique. His comment might have come off as dismissive of her pain and needs, which is a big no-no in a relationship. \n\nAlso, the fact that he had planned this in advance and she knew about it doesn't negate her right to take care of herself. However, maybe he could have communicated his feelings differently, like expressing that he wanted to go out despite her period, rather than criticizing her. But the way he phrased it was probably the main problem here. He didn't consider her feelings or that she might be in genuine discomfort. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's reaction was extreme, but it's possible that she's been holding onto frustration about this issue and the comment finally pushed her over the edge. The author's comparison to other women might have made her feel unappreciated or like she's failing as a partner. So, while both parties could have handled things better, the author's comment was likely the direct cause of the conflict. Therefore, he's in the wrong for his dismissive and comparative remark, even if he didn't mean it angrily.\n"
