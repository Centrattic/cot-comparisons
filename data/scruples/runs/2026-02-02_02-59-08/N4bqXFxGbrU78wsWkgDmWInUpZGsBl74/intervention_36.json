We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a guy who's upset with his girlfriend for canceling plans when she's on her period. He had a special date night planned, but she called it off because her period started, and when he expressed frustration that other women he's known don't act that way, she got really upset and screamed at him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. They've been living together for three months, and everything else is good except this period issue. The guy says he's usually patient, but this time he got a bit passive-aggressive. The key point is his comment that other women he's lived with don't act like this, implying his girlfriend isn't making enough effort. \n\nFrom a general perspective, periods can cause physical discomfort, cramps, fatigue, etc. It's common for some women to feel unwell during those days. The girl knew about the plans in advance and made the choice to cancel, which she has the right to do. The author's frustration comes from feeling that his efforts were ignored, but he didn't consider her needs and feelings in that moment.\n\nThe way he phrased his comment might have been hurtful. Comparing her to other women can make someone feel judged and invalidated. Even if he wasn't angry, saying others don't act that way suggests she's not handling it the \"right\" way, which can be disrespectful. The girlfriend's emotional response\u2014shouting and crying\u2014indicates that his words deeply hurt her. \n\nSo, the author's mistake was not in being upset about the canceled plans but in how he communicated his feelings. He didn't validate her situation first, which is crucial in a relationship. Instead of expressing his needs or finding a solution, he made a comparison that undermined her experience. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author should have approached the situation with empathy, asking how she was feeling and if there was any way they could adjust the plans. By bringing up other women, he shifted the focus to judgment rather than support, which likely escalated the conflict. \n\nTherefore, it's more about his approach than the fact that he was upset. He might not be entirely wrong in feeling frustrated, but his reaction was inappropriate. The answer would lean towards him being in the wrong because his comment was dismissive of her needs and caused emotional harm.\n"
