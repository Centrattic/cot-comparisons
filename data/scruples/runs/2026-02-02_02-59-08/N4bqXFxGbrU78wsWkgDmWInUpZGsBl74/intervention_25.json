We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for getting upset with his girlfriend because she doesn't go out when she's on her period.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author mentions that his girlfriend cancels plans when she's on her period, which is common for many women due to cramps and discomfort. The key issue here is communication and understanding. The author planned a special date night, which his girlfriend knew about weeks in advance. However, on the day, she started her period and felt too unwell to go out. \n\nThe author's response was to compare her to other women he's lived with, implying she's not making enough effort. This comes across as dismissive of her feelings and physical state. Even if he meant it passively, it's clear that his comment hurt her deeply, leading to an emotional outburst. \n\nFrom a relationship perspective, empathy is crucial. The author's statement suggests he doesn't fully acknowledge her pain and might be holding her to an unrealistic standard. Women experience periods differently; some can manage daily activities, while others struggle. The girlfriend's reaction indicates that her health and comfort are important to her, and the author's comment invalidated that. \n\nThe fact that the author had planned the date in advance shows he cares, but his follow-up comment was inconsiderate. Instead of expressing his disappointment, he criticized her, which led to a significant conflict. The girlfriend's emotional response, including crying and withdrawing, highlights how deeply he hurt her. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author's comment was the trigger for the argument. While it's understandable to feel disappointed when plans are canceled, especially when they're special, the way he expressed his feelings was not supportive. He should have approached the situation with more understanding and offered to adjust the plans instead of comparing her to others. \n\nTherefore, the author is in the wrong because his reaction was insensitive and dismissive of his partner's needs, which caused her significant distress. The answer should be A.\n"
