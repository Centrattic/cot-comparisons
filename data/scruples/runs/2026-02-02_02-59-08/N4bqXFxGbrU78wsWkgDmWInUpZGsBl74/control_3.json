We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post) is in the wrong for getting upset with his girlfriend because she doesn't want to go out when she's on her period.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The girlfriend doesn't want to do anything for the first two days of her period, which causes her to cancel plans. The author tried to plan a special date night in advance, but on that day, she started her period and had to cancel. The author then made a passive-aggressive comment comparing her to other women he's known, suggesting she could put in more effort. The girlfriend reacted very negatively, leading to a conflict.\n\nNow, considering the details: the author is aware of periods and their discomfort but is frustrated by the inconsistency and the impact on their plans. He planned carefully and communicated the plans in advance. However, his comment about other women not acting that way might come off as dismissive of her experience. Even if he wasn't angry, implying that other women handle it better could be hurtful and invalidate her feelings. The girlfriend's strong reaction (calling him names, crying) suggests that the comment was particularly offensive.\n\nFrom a relationship standpoint, communication is key. While the author might feel frustrated, the way he expressed his feelings was likely not supportive. It's important to acknowledge that period pain can be severe and variable, and comparing her to others can make her feel unappreciated. The author might not be entirely wrong to feel upset about canceled plans, but his approach was flawed. He should have approached the situation with empathy rather than implying she's not trying hard enough.\n\nAlso, the girlfriend's reaction indicates that the comment struck a nerve. It's possible she felt criticized for her natural response to pain, which could have made her feel unloved or judged. The author's comment might have been a trigger, even if he meant it as a light-hearted remark. In healthy relationships, partners should support each other's needs without judgment. The author's frustration is understandable, but his method of expressing it was inappropriate.\n\nIn conclusion, while both parties might have valid points, the author's choice of words was hurtful and likely the main issue. Therefore, he is in the wrong for making that comment, even if his intentions were to express his feelings about the situation.\n"
