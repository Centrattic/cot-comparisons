We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about the author getting upset because his girlfriend cancels plans when she's on her period. He planned a special date night, but when she had her period that day, she canceled. He told her that other women he's lived with didn't act like that, which led to her huge reaction.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points. The author's girlfriend is clearly uncomfortable during her period and cancels plans on the first two days. He's been putting up with it until this specific instance where he had a planned date. He mentions that she knew about the plans weeks in advance, but she still canceled. He made a comment comparing her to other women, implying she should put in more effort.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics here. Periods can be really tough physically and emotionally. It's a natural biological process, and while some women might handle it differently, it's not fair to compare one person's experience to another's. The author's comment about other women not acting like that is problematic because it invalidates her feelings and experiences. Even if he's not angry, the passive-aggressive remark could be hurtful. She had a strong emotional reaction, which suggests that his words were deeply offensive to her.\n\nThe key here is empathy. The author might not realize that his comment was dismissive of her pain. Even if he's trying to be understanding by saying \"I know girls get cramps,\" bringing up other women implies that she's not meeting his expectations. The fact that she locked herself in her room and they haven't talked since shows the severity of the impact his words had.\n\nAlso, planning a date night that she knew about but still canceled could be a miscommunication. Maybe she thought she could handle it that day but couldn't, or maybe she's been struggling more than usual. But instead of checking in, he made a judgment. The author needs to take responsibility for his part in the argument by making a hurtful comparison.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author should approach her to apologize for the comment, validate her feelings, and discuss how to handle future plans. Comparing one's experiences to others is rarely helpful and can cause rifts. So yes, the author is in the wrong here for not supporting his girlfriend and for making a comparative statement that hurt her.\n"
