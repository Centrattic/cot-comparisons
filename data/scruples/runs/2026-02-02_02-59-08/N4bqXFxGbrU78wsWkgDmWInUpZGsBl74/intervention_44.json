We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The situation involves the author getting upset with his girlfriend because she cancels their plans when she's on her period. He planned a special date night, but she called it off due to her period and he made a comment comparing her to other women who might not act that way. She got really upset, yelled at him, cried, and they haven't talked since. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know what I think.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author planned a date weeks in advance, and the girlfriend canceled because she was on her period. He mentioned knowing other women who don't act this way, which probably made her feel criticized. She had a strong emotional reaction, which is unusual for her. \n\nThe main issue here is communication and empathy. The author's comment about other women could be seen as invalidating her experience. Even if he wasn't angry, saying that others don't act this way might make her feel like her pain isn't being taken seriously. It's important to acknowledge her discomfort and be supportive, rather than comparing her to others.\n\nAlso, the author might not fully understand the severity of her symptoms. Some women experience severe cramps, fatigue, or other issues during their period, making it hard to engage in normal activities. Assuming she's just \"curling up on the couch\" without considering her actual pain could be part of the problem. The author planned something that he knew she might not be able to do, but he still expected her to go through with it despite her known limitations.\n\nAnother point is that the author didn't consider alternative plans. If she was feeling unwell, maybe suggesting a different activity at home could have been a better approach. Instead, he was upset about the cancellation, which shows a lack of flexibility and support.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction, while intense, might be a result of feeling criticized and not supported. The author's comment likely hurt her feelings, making her feel unappreciated or misunderstood. His failure to validate her situation led to a breakdown in communication.\n\nIn relationships, it's crucial to support each other through health issues. The author's frustration is understandable, but his approach was not supportive. He should have focused on empathy rather than comparisons. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for not being understanding and for making a hurtful comment.\n"
