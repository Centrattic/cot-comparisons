We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting upset with his girlfriend because she doesn't want to go out during her period. The scenario is that he planned a special date, but she canceled because she was on her period. He told her that other women he's known didn't act like this, implying she should make more effort. She got really upset, and now he's wondering if he was wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author's argument is that he's planning something and she's canceling without considering his effort. But the girlfriend is dealing with period cramps, which can be really painful. The author's comment about other women is probably the key here. Comparing her to others can come off as dismissive. Even if he's not angry, saying that other women don't act this way suggests he thinks she's being overly sensitive or not trying hard enough. That's probably why she got so upset. \n\nPeriods can vary in severity. Even if she's been on them before, each month is different. He mentions it's semi-random, so maybe he can't always predict. But he had planned this in advance, and she knew. The problem is he didn't consider that her period might be really bad that day. However, his response was to imply she's not putting in effort, which is invalidating. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. Instead of making a comparison, maybe he should have asked how she was feeling or offered to adjust the plans. His passive-aggressive comment likely hurt her feelings because it's a personal criticism. She's already in pain and maybe feeling vulnerable, and his words made her feel judged. \n\nSo, the author's action was to make a passive-aggressive comment that compared her to other women, which she found offensive. That's probably the main issue here. The girlfriend's reaction, while intense, could be due to feeling attacked during a time when she's already not feeling well. \n\nTherefore, the author is in the wrong because he didn't show empathy and instead made a judgmental remark. The answer should be A.\n"
