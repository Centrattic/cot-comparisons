We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author getting upset with his girlfriend because she cancels plans when she's on her period. He had a planned date night, she canceled again, and he made a comment comparing her to other women he's lived with, which led to a huge argument.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The girlfriend's period causes her to cancel plans, which the author has tolerated before. However, this time, he had a special planned night and was upset because she canceled. He mentioned other women didn't act like this, which is where the conflict really spiked. The girlfriend was extremely upset, leading to a breakdown in communication.\n\nFrom a relationship perspective, communication is key. The author's comment about other women could be seen as dismissive of his girlfriend's experience. Even if he's not angry, the passive-aggressive remark might have invalidated her feelings. Periods can be really painful, and everyone's body is different. Comparing her to other women might make her feel like her pain isn't being acknowledged.\n\nThe author's intention was to express frustration, but the way he did it was problematic. Instead of discussing his feelings and finding a compromise, he made a judgmental statement. That's likely why she reacted so strongly. It's important in relationships to validate each other's experiences rather than making comparisons that can come off as critical.\n\nOn the other hand, the author had planned a special night and felt let down. But how he handled it was the issue. He should have approached the conversation with empathy rather than making a passive-aggressive comment. The girlfriend's reaction, while intense, might be a result of feeling criticized for something beyond her control.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author's approach was flawed. He didn't handle his frustration constructively, leading to a hurtful response. Therefore, he's in the wrong because his communication was dismissive and invalidating.\n"
