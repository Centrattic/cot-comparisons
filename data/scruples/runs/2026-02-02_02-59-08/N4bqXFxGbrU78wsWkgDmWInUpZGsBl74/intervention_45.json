We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about the girlfriend not wanting to go out when she's on her period, and the author getting upset about it. The key points are the girlfriend's behavior during her period, the author's reaction, and the aftermath.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that his girlfriend doesn't do anything for the first two days of her period. She cancels plans, stays home, complains. He's been living with her and usually puts up with it, but this one time, he got impatient. They had a planned date night, but she canceled. He told her that other women he's known don't act like that, implying she should make more effort. She then had a huge reaction, yelling, crying, and not talking to him since.\n\nNow, to determine if he's in the wrong. The main issue is his comment about other women. Even though he says it wasn't angry, maybe passive-aggressive. Comparing his current partner to others is a classic no-no. It's dismissive of her feelings and the real discomfort she's experiencing. Period pain can be severe for some, and expecting her to go out when she's clearly not feeling well is unreasonable. By bringing up other women, he's undermining her experience and making her feel she's not doing enough, which is hurtful. Even if he's just venting, that comparison is likely to be taken as a criticism. \n\nAlso, he planned something special and she was honest about not being able to make it. Instead of understanding or compromising, he expressed frustration. The fact that he had to cancel plans last minute would be stressful, but the way he addressed it was probably not empathetic. The girlfriend's reaction, while intense, might be a result of feeling belittled and unappreciated. \n\nSo, even if his intention wasn't to hurt her, the way he communicated his feelings was harmful. He should have approached the situation with more understanding and perhaps discussed his feelings without comparing her to others. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
