We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the AITA post) is in the wrong. The situation is about a girlfriend who doesn't want to go out when she's on her period, and the author got upset because she canceled their special plans.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author mentions that the girlfriend cancels plans whenever she's on her period, which happens semi-randomly each month. He usually puts up with it, but this time he got impatient. He planned a special date night in advance, and she canceled it because her period started. He told her that other women he's known don't act like this, implying she should put in more effort. She reacted extremely negatively, calling him names and crying.\n\nNow, the key points here are communication and understanding. The author's girlfriend might be experiencing significant discomfort, and cramps can vary in intensity. Comparing her to other women he's known might come off as dismissive of her specific situation. The author's comment about other women not acting that way could sound judgmental or invalidating. Even if he wasn't angry, the passive-aggressive remark might have hurt her feelings, especially if she's already in pain or stressed.\n\nIt's important to consider that periods can affect people differently. What's manageable for one person might not be for another. The author might not have realized how sensitive this issue is for his girlfriend. By bringing up other women, he might have made her feel like her experience isn't valid or that she's exaggerating her discomfort. That could explain her strong reaction.\n\nAdditionally, the author planned the date knowing her period could come at any time. Maybe he didn't consider that she might not be able to go despite knowing about the plans. The fact that she canceled last minute might have frustrated him, but it's possible he should have been more flexible or communicated better about his feelings instead of making a comparison.\n\nIn relationships, it's crucial to validate each other's experiences. The author's comment might have been the tipping point because it dismissed her feelings. Even if he thought he was being reasonable, the way he expressed his feelings could have been hurtful. The girlfriend's reaction suggests that the comment was a significant breach of trust or understanding.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's approach might have been inconsiderate. He should have found a way to express his frustration without comparing her to others. The fact that she felt so wronged that she reacted so strongly indicates that his words were harmful. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong here.\n"
