We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author's girlfriend not going out during her period and him getting upset.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author's girlfriend cancels plans when she's on her period, which he's usually okay with, but this one time he got upset because he had plans. He mentioned other women he's lived with don't act like that, which made her angry. She reacted strongly, calling him names and crying. Now he's wondering if he's in the wrong.\n\nSo, the main issue here is about expectations during a period. The author expected his girlfriend to make an effort for their date night, even if she was on her period. He compared her to other women, which probably hurt her feelings. The girlfriend felt unappreciated and maybe disbelieved about her pain.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author might not have considered how his words could come off as invalidating her experience. Saying that other women don't act that way could imply that she's overreacting or not trying hard enough, which isn't supportive. Periods can be really tough for some women, and everyone's different. What works for one person might not for another.\n\nThe author planned the date knowing her period can be unpredictable, but maybe he didn't account for her needs. His comment about other women might have been a trigger, making her feel like she's not being supported. The girlfriend's strong reaction suggests that the author's words were hurtful and crossed a line.\n\nEven if his intention wasn't to be aggressive, the passive-aggressive comment could be seen as dismissive. It's important to validate her feelings and offer support rather than comparing her to others. The author should have discussed his feelings without making a comparison, perhaps expressing that he wanted to spend time together but understanding her limitations.\n\nIn conclusion, the author likely did something wrong by not respecting his girlfriend's boundaries and invalidating her experience. Comparing her to others is generally a bad move in relationships and can cause hurt feelings. The answer should be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
