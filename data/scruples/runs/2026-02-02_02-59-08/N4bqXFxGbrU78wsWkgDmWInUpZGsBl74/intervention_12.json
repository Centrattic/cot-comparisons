We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about the girlfriend not wanting to go out when she's on her period, especially during those first two days. The author plans a special date, but they cancel because of her period. The author then expresses frustration by saying other women he's lived with don't act this way, which leads to a big argument.\n\nFirst, the author's actions: He planned a date knowing her period can be unpredictable. He's upset because she canceled, even though he knew about the possibility. His comment comparing her to other women is key here. Even if he's not angry, the passive-aggressive remark might come off as dismissive. Women's experiences with periods vary, and comparing her to others could invalidate her feelings. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is intense, including crying and anger. That suggests she felt hurt or disrespected by his comment. The author's justification that he's \"just a weensy bit justified\" downplays the impact of his words. \n\nConsidering communication, the author might have assumed his frustration was minor, but the way he expressed it was harmful. The girlfriend's reaction is a sign that she felt attacked. So, the author's approach was flawed. He should have addressed his feelings without comparing her to others. \n\nTherefore, the answer is A (yes, he's in the wrong) because his comment was dismissive of her experience and triggered a negative reaction.\n"
