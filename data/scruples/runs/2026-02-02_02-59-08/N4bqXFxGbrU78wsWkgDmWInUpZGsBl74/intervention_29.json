We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong. The situation is that the author got upset with his girlfriend for canceling their date night because she was on her period. They had planned it weeks in advance, and she knew about it. The author compared her behavior to other women he's lived with, implying she's not making enough effort. The girlfriend reacted strongly, leading to a conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author acknowledges that periods can be difficult, especially with cramps. He usually puts up with it, so he's aware of the physical discomfort. However, the key issue here is the date night. He had plans that she canceled, which led to his frustration. The problem is how he expressed his frustration. He mentioned knowing other women who don't act that way, which could be seen as a comparison that's hurtful. Comparing one's partner to others is often a no-go in relationships because it can make them feel inadequate or not valued.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction was intense\u2014calling him names, crying, and locking herself in her room. This suggests that the comment about other women really struck a nerve. The author might not have realized how sensitive this topic is for her. Even if his intention was to express his disappointment, the way he did it was probably dismissive of her needs and feelings. \n\nThe author planned something special, which is great, but expecting his partner to push through period pain to meet his expectations might be unrealistic. Periods can vary in severity, and some days are just too hard. The girlfriend's choice to prioritize her health and comfort is valid. The author's frustration is understandable, but the way he addressed it was not respectful. \n\nHe could have communicated his feelings without comparing her to others. Maybe he could have asked if there was a way to adjust the plans or offer support instead of expressing disappointment through a comparison. The fact that he had planned it weeks in advance and she knew about it might make her feel pressured, especially if she's not feeling well. \n\nIn relationships, empathy and understanding are crucial. Even though the author has a valid reason for being upset (his plans were canceled), the way he handled the situation wasn't considerate of her feelings. The girlfriend's strong reaction indicates that the author's words were hurtful, which makes him at least partially at fault. \n\nSo, considering all this, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because his approach was disrespectful and dismissive of her situation, even if his intentions weren't entirely malicious.\n"
