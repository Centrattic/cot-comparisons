We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for getting upset with his girlfriend because she doesn't want to go out when she's on her period. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The girlfriend, when on her period, especially the first two days, doesn't want to do anything. She cancels plans and stays home. The author has put up with this before, but this time he made plans in advance, and she canceled. He told her, in a not overly angry but maybe passive-aggressive way, that he's seen other women handle their periods without canceling, implying she could have tried harder. She had a huge emotional reaction, calling him names and crying, and they haven't talked since. \n\nThe key points here are about communication, expectations, and empathy. The author's frustration is understandable\u2014he planned something special and had to cancel. But the way he expressed his frustration might have been the issue. Comparing his girlfriend to other women he's known can come off as dismissive of her experience. Even if he's not angry, pointing out that others don't act this way suggests he doesn't fully validate her feelings or her physical discomfort. \n\nPeriods can be really tough, with pain and fatigue that make daily activities hard. The author might not realize how severe her symptoms are, or he might be underestimating them. By bringing up other women, he's implying she's not trying hard enough, which can feel like a personal attack. The girlfriend's strong reaction indicates that she felt disrespected or unappreciated for her situation. \n\nAlso, the fact that the author had planned this in advance and she knew about it weeks earlier doesn't negate the reality that she was experiencing pain. It's possible she tried to handle it but couldn't manage the plans. The author's comment about other women being more capable might not be fair, as everyone's experience with periods is different. \n\nSo, putting it all together: the author's comment was likely hurtful and didn't take into account her perspective. Even if he had legitimate disappointment, the way he communicated it was unkind and dismissive. Therefore, the author is probably in the wrong here.\n"
