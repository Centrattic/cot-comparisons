We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again to make sure I understand it.\n\nThe author's girlfriend cancels plans when she's on her period, especially for the first two days. She's been doing this for a while, and the author usually puts up with it. But one time, they had a special date night planned weeks in advance, and the girlfriend canceled because her period started that day. The author, instead of being understanding, made a passive-aggressive comment comparing her to other women he's lived with, implying she should put more effort. This led to a huge argument and the girlfriend being upset.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the girlfriend has a history of canceling when on her period, the author planned a special date, she canceled, he made a passive-aggressive remark, and she reacted strongly. The author is now wondering if he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. The girlfriend's behavior is a recurring issue. The author mentions that her periods come at a \"semi-random time,\" making it hard to plan around. But in this case, they had planned weeks ahead. However, maybe she didn't know the exact timing of her period when they made the plans. Or maybe she did know and still agreed to it, but the period started earlier than expected.\n\nThe author's reaction was to compare her to other women he's lived with, implying she's not handling her period as well as others. This is a classic example of a double standard\u2014judging her based on others without considering her individual situation. Even if other women didn't act the same way, it's not fair to hold that against her. Every person experiences their period differently. Some might have severe cramps, others not as much. The author's comment could come off as invalidating her feelings and experiences.\n\nPassive-aggressive communication is never good. Even if the author wasn't angry, the way he expressed his frustration was undermining. Instead of addressing the issue directly and empathetically, he used a backhanded comment that hurt her feelings. The girlfriend's strong reaction (calling him names, crying, locking herself in) suggests that his words were deeply hurtful and crossed a line.\n\nAnother angle: the author planned the date in advance, but the girlfriend might have agreed to it without knowing her period would start that day. If her period is irregular, she might not be able to plan around it. The author's frustration is understandable, but expecting her to go out despite her discomfort is unreasonable. However, the way he expressed his frustration was the problem. Instead of being supportive, he criticized her, which is not the right approach.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction, while intense, is a response to being criticized and compared unfavorably to others. It's understandable she felt attacked. The author should have handled the situation with more empathy and understanding, perhaps offering to adjust the plans or supporting her without making her feel inadequate.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the author's main mistake was his communication style and the comparison to other women. He should have been more understanding and found a way to support her instead of expressing frustration in a hurtful way. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
