We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the author of this AITA post is in the wrong. Let me read through the scenario carefully.\n\nThe main issue here is the author's reaction to their girlfriend not wanting to go out when she's on her period. The author had planned a special date night, but the girlfriend canceled because of her period, which the author found frustrating. The key point is the author's comment about other women not acting this way, which led to a big argument.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the general understanding of period symptoms. It's well-known that some women experience severe cramps, fatigue, and other symptoms during their period, which can make them less inclined to go out or engage in activities. The author seems to acknowledge this to some extent, as he says \"I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever.\" But the problem arises when he compares his girlfriend to other women he's lived with, implying that her reaction is excessive or not normal.\n\nThe author's comment about other women not acting like this could be seen as dismissive of his girlfriend's feelings and experiences. Even if he meant it to be a light-hearted or passive-aggressive remark, it clearly crossed a line. Comparing one's partner to others in a negative way is often a sensitive issue, especially when it's about health or well-being. The girlfriend's strong reaction suggests that the comment was hurtful and invalidated her experience.\n\nThe fact that the author planned the date weeks in advance and the girlfriend knew about it doesn't negate the fact that she's experiencing something physical and possibly painful. While it's reasonable to want to make plans, expecting someone to push through severe period symptoms might be unreasonable. The author could have shown more empathy and understanding instead of making a comparison that made her feel criticized.\n\nThe girlfriend's response was extreme, but the author's comment was the trigger. It's important to consider that even if the author wasn't angry, the passive-aggressive remark was still a form of communication that can be hurtful. The key here is whether the author's actions were respectful and supportive. By bringing up other women, he undermined her feelings and made her feel like her experience was invalid or abnormal, which is inconsiderate.\n\nIn relationships, it's crucial to approach disagreements with empathy and a willingness to understand the other person's perspective. The author could have expressed his disappointment without making a comparative statement that was offensive. Instead, he chose a method that clearly hurt his partner, leading to a major argument. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong here for dismissing his girlfriend's legitimate experiences and for the way he communicated his frustration."
