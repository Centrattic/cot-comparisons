We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation is about their girlfriend not wanting to go out when she's on her period, and the author getting upset about it.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author's girlfriend cancels plans for the first two days of her period, which she says is due to cramps. The author usually puts up with this but got frustrated one time when they had a planned date night. The author then made a comment that other women don't act this way, which led to an argument and the girlfriend being upset.\n\nSo, the main issue here is about the author's comment. The author is comparing his current girlfriend to others he's known, implying that she's not making enough effort. Even if he wasn't angry, the passive-aggressive remark about other women probably hurt her feelings. Comparing partners to others is generally a bad move in relationships because it can come off as dismissive and disrespectful, especially when discussing sensitive topics like health or physical discomfort.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction, while intense, might be a result of feeling criticized during a time when she's already vulnerable. Her period is a natural bodily function that often comes with pain, and expecting her to push through it might be unrealistic. The author's frustration is understandable, but the way he expressed it was likely the problem. \n\nAlso, the author had planned the date weeks in advance, and the girlfriend knew about it. However, her period is unpredictable, as she mentioned. It's possible she didn't expect it to start that day. Still, the author's response was to make a comparison that made her feel like she wasn't trying hard enough, which is unfair. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. Instead of comparing her to others, the author should have discussed his feelings without blame. He might need to acknowledge her discomfort and find a compromise for future plans, rather than expecting her to cancel every time. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's comment was the catalyst for the argument. Even if his intention wasn't to be cruel, the comparison was hurtful. Therefore, he's in the wrong.\n"
