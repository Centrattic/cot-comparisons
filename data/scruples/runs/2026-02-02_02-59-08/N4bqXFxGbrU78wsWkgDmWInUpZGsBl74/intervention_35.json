We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by breaking down the situation. The user is asking if they're the asshole (AITA) for getting upset with his girlfriend because she doesn't want to go out when she's on her period.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend is described as great, and they've been living together for three months with everything going well except the period issue. She stays home for the first two days of her period, even canceling plans. He tries to be understanding but then there's this specific incident where he planned a special date night. She had known about it weeks in advance, but her period started that day, and she wanted to cancel. The author then comments that other women he's known don't act like this, implying she should put in more effort. This leads to her blowing up at him, calling him names, crying, and not talking to him since.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author planned something special, the girlfriend cancels due to her period, and the author expresses his frustration by comparing her to other women who don't cancel. The girlfriend reacts strongly negatively.\n\nNow, the user is asking if he's in the wrong. My initial thought is that the author is in the wrong. Here's why: even though he might be frustrated, comparing her to other women is probably a major issue. It's dismissive of her feelings and physical state. Periods can be really painful and unpredictable, and even though he mentions she plans around them, the fact that she can't predict the exact start date might be a factor. The author's comment about other women not acting like this could be seen as invalidating her experience. It's not just about her not wanting to go out, but him implying that her response is unreasonable compared to others. That could be hurtful and disrespectful, especially if she's already in pain. The girlfriend's strong reaction suggests that his words hurt her deeply, leading to the argument. So, the author's remark was probably the main issue here. Even if he wasn't angry, the passive-aggressive comment comparing her to others is a problem. The answer would be A (author is in the wrong).\n"
