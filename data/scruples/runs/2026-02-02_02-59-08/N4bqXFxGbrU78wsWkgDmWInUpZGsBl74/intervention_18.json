We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is that the author's girlfriend cancels plans when she's on her period, and the author got upset, leading to a big argument.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author had planned a special date night in advance, and the girlfriend canceled because she started her period that day. The author made a comment comparing her to other women he's lived with, saying they don't act like that, implying the girlfriend should put in more effort. The girlfriend reacted very strongly, calling him names and crying, and they haven't talked since.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants confirmation. Let's consider both sides. On one hand, the author had a plan he put time into, and the girlfriend didn't communicate about her period changes. But on the other hand, periods can be painful and unpredictable, and the author's comment about other women might come off as dismissive or invalidating. Comparing partners to others is usually a bad move because it can sound resentful and not supportive.\n\nThe author's main mistake might be in how he approached the issue. Even if he wasn't angry, saying that other women don't act like that could have made the girlfriend feel criticized. It's important to validate her feelings and pain, not question her behavior by comparing to others. The girlfriend's reaction, while intense, might be because she felt attacked. The author didn't consider that her needs are valid and that his comment dismissed her experience. So, even if the girlfriend's reaction was strong, the author's approach was probably inappropriate. So, answer A (Yes, author is in the wrong).\n"
