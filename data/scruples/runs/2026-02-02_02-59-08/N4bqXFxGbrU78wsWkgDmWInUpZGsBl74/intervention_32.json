We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for getting upset with his girlfriend over her not wanting to go out when she's on her period.\n\nFirst, the context: They've been living together for three months. The girlfriend avoids activities for the first two days of her period, even canceling plans. The author has been patient but one time, after planning a special date, she cancels again, and he expresses frustration by comparing her to other women he's known who don't act like that. She reacts strongly, leading to a conflict.\n\nThe key points here are communication and empathy. The author planned a special evening, which shows he cares. However, the way he expressed his disappointment by comparing her to others could come off as dismissive of her experience. Even if he wasn't angry, the passive-aggressive comment about other women might invalidate her feelings and pain. \n\nPeriods can be really uncomfortable, and everyone's experience is different. While it's understandable that he wanted to go out, the comparison might imply that her reaction is excessive. It's possible he didn't realize how hurtful that comment was, especially since she's already in pain and stress. \n\nIn relationships, it's important to validate each other's feelings. The author's frustration is valid, but the way he communicated it might have ignored her needs. The girlfriend's strong reaction suggests that the comment hurt her deeply. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author might be in the wrong because his approach wasn't empathetic. He could have expressed his feelings without invalidating her experience. The answer is likely A (author is in the wrong).\n"
