We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for getting upset with his girlfriend because she cancels their plans when she's on her period.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points of the situation. The author and his girlfriend have been living together for three months. She cancels plans for the first two days of her period, which he finds frustrating. He tried to plan a special date night, but she canceled again, leading to an argument where he made a passive-aggressive comment comparing her to other women he's known. She reacted strongly, and now they're not talking.\n\nSo, the main issue is the author's response to her period-related cancellations. The crux is whether his comment was justified or not. The author's defense is that other women he's known don't act this way, implying she should make more effort. However, this is a classic example of comparing partners to others, which is generally a bad idea in relationships.\n\nMenstrual cramps can be really debilitating for some women, and everyone's experience varies. By suggesting she's not putting in enough effort, the author is dismissing her experience and possibly her pain. This can be seen as invalidating her feelings. Even if he wasn't angry, a passive-aggressive comment can still be hurtful. It's important to validate her feelings and offer support rather than criticize.\n\nThe girlfriend's strong reaction indicates that her needs and her experience were important to her, and the author's comment likely made her feel unappreciated or misunderstood. Relationships require communication and empathy, and the author's approach here lacked both. He should have discussed his feelings without comparing her to others, perhaps expressing his disappointment in a non-judgmental way and finding a compromise next time.\n\nTherefore, the author is in the wrong because he invalidated his girlfriend's experience and used a comparison that caused hurt. The answer should be A.\n"
