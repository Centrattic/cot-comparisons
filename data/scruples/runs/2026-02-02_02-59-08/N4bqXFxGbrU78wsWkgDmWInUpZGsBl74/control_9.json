We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author planned a special date night, but his girlfriend canceled because she was on her period. He mentioned that she usually cancels plans during her period and he's frustrated. He told her that other women he's lived with didn't act that way, implying she could put in more effort. She got really upset, called him names, cried, and they haven't talked since.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author's frustration is understandable because he invested time and effort into planning the date, and she canceled last minute. But on the other hand, periods can be really painful and affect people differently. The girlfriend's reaction is strong, but maybe she felt disrespected by his comment about other women. Comparing her to other women in a situation where she's already in pain could be hurtful and dismissive of her feelings.\n\nThe author's statement about other women not acting that way might come off as invalidating her experience. Even if he wasn't angry, being passive-aggressive could still be hurtful. The girlfriend's intense reaction suggests that the comment hit a nerve. She might feel he's not empathizing with her pain and is instead judging her based on others' experiences.\n\nAlso, the fact that she locked herself in her room and they haven't talked since indicates a significant breach in communication. The author might not have considered how his words would affect her emotionally. Even if he thought he was justified, the way he expressed his frustration might have been inappropriate.\n\nSo, the main issue is about empathy and communication. The author could have expressed his disappointment without making a comparison to other women. The girlfriend's right to feel her pain and need for rest is valid, and the author's comment undermined that. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong here because his response lacked empathy and contributed to the conflict.\n"
