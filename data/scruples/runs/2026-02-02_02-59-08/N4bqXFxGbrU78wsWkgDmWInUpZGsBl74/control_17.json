We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a girlfriend who doesn't want to go out when she's on her period, and the author got upset after she canceled their planned date night.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author's girlfriend is generally great, but during her period, especially the first two days, she doesn't want to do anything. The author usually puts up with it, but this time there was a special date night that she canceled. He told her that other women he's known don't act this way, implying she should put in more effort. She got extremely upset, yelled at him, cried, and they haven't talked since. The question is whether the author is at fault.\n\nSo, the main issue here is communication and expectations. The author planned a special date, and the girlfriend canceled it because of her period. He expressed his frustration by comparing her to other women, which came off as passive-aggressive. The girlfriend's reaction was intense, indicating that his comment was hurtful and possibly dismissive of her pain or needs.\n\nFrom a relationship perspective, it's important to respect each other's needs. Menstrual cramps can be debilitating for some people, and it's not just about \"putting in effort.\" The author might not have considered that his girlfriend's reaction is due to physical discomfort and that comparing her to others is invalidating. The fact that she locked herself in her room and they haven't talked since suggests the comment was a major breach in their communication.\n\nThe author's expectation that she should still go out despite her period might be unrealistic. While it's good to plan and make efforts, partners should also be understanding of each other's health and well-being. The way he communicated his frustration, by bringing up other women, was likely the trigger. It's not about whether she's \"wrong\" for having her period, but about how the author handled his disappointment.\n\nSo, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong because he dismissed his girlfriend's needs and used a comparison that hurt her, leading to a significant conflict. The key here is empathy and communication. The author should have discussed his feelings without belittling her experience.\n"
