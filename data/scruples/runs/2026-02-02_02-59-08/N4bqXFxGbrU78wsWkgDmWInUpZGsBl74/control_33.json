We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting upset with his girlfriend because she doesn't want to go out when she's on her period.\n\nFirst, the context: The couple has been living together for three months. The girlfriend usually cancels plans when she's on her period, especially the first two days. The author is frustrated because she canceled a special date night they had planned weeks in advance. He mentioned that she knew about the plans and that she was on her period that day. He told her that other women he's known don't act this way, implying she's not making enough effort. She reacted strongly, calling him names and crying, and they haven't talked since.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. From a relationship perspective, communication is key. The girlfriend clearly has a medical reason (period cramps) that affects her ability to go out. The author's frustration is understandable, but how he expressed it might be the issue. Comparing her behavior to other women and suggesting she's not making enough effort could be seen as invalidating her feelings. Even if he was calm and passive-aggressive, the comment about other women might come off as dismissive of her pain or discomfort.\n\nIn many relationships, supporting each other through health issues is important. The author's reaction might have been about his own inconvenience rather than her well-being. The girlfriend's strong reaction suggests that her boundaries were crossed, possibly because she felt judged or criticized. She might have felt that he wasn't respecting her needs, leading to her emotional outburst.\n\nAdditionally, the author mentions that her period comes at a \"semi-random time,\" which he can't plan around. However, the responsibility for managing such unpredictable health issues might lie with both partners. The key here is how the author communicated his feelings. Instead of comparing her to others, he could have discussed his feelings and perhaps found a compromise for future situations.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author might not be entirely wrong in feeling frustrated, but his approach to expressing that frustration was likely inappropriate. He should have considered her perspective more and perhaps found a way to address his needs without criticizing her. The girlfriend's reaction is a strong indicator that his comments hurt her, which suggests that the author did cross a line.\n\nSo, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because his comment about other women and the passive-aggressive remark likely invalidated her feelings and contributed to the conflict.\n"
