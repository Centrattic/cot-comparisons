We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about the author getting upset with his girlfriend because she cancels plans when she's on her period. He planned a special date night, but she ended up being on her period and wanted to stay home. He compared her to other women he's lived with, implying she's not trying hard enough. She got really upset, yelled at him, and they haven't talked since.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author is frustrated because his girlfriend cancels plans during her period. He's made plans in advance, but she ends up being too unwell. He mentioned she doesn't want to do anything for the first two days. He's also noted that her period comes at a semi-random time, making it hard to plan around. However, the main issue is his reaction when she canceled their plans. He told her that other women he's known don't act like that, suggesting she could put in more effort. That led to her losing her temper and crying.\n\nNow, to evaluate if the author is in the wrong. From what I know, PMS and menstrual cramps can be really debilitating for some women. It's not just about being lazy or not trying. The author seems to be invalidating her feelings by comparing her to others. Saying that other women don't act like that implies that his girlfriend's experience isn't valid or extreme. That's pretty dismissive and could come across as insensitive. Even if he wasn't angry, a passive-aggressive comment like that can be hurtful. It's possible he didn't mean to be cruel, but the message is that her pain isn't as bad as others, or that she's overreacting. \n\nCommunication is key here. The author should have approached the situation with empathy instead of making a comparison. He could have asked how she's feeling and offered to help, rather than implying she should push through. The girlfriend's reaction was intense, but it's understandable if she felt disrespected. The author's comment probably made her feel unappreciated and judged, which is why she blew up at him. \n\nSo, even if the author's intention was to express his frustration, the way he did it was inconsiderate. He should have been more understanding of her situation instead of using other women as a benchmark. Therefore, the answer is likely that the author is in the wrong. The correct choice would be A.\n"
