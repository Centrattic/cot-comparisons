We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for getting upset with his girlfriend over her period.\n\nFirst, the situation: The girlfriend doesn't want to go out when she's on her period, especially for the first two days. The author planned a special date, but she canceled because she got her period that day. He mentioned that other women he's lived with didn't act like this, which upset her a lot. She got extremely angry and cried, and they haven't talked since.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics here. The author's main issue is that he felt his plans were disregarded because of her period. He made a comment comparing her behavior to other women's, implying she's not making enough effort. The key point here is communication and empathy. Even if he's not angry, bringing up other women in a comparison can be hurtful. It suggests he doesn't fully understand or validate her experience with period-related discomfort.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction\u2014being extremely upset and crying\u2014indicates that his comment was a significant emotional trigger. Comparing her to others is a classic way people feel criticized, which can be deeply hurtful. Even if his intention wasn't to be harsh, the impact was negative. The fact that she \"lost her SHIT\" shows that his words were perceived as dismissive of her needs.\n\nAdditionally, the author should consider that everyone's experiences with periods vary. What's normal for one person might not be for another. By implying that others don't act this way, he's invalidating her feelings and physical state. It's important to acknowledge that period pain can be severe and affect daily activities, and plans might need to be adjusted accordingly.\n\nThe author's plan was made weeks in advance, and the girlfriend knew about it. However, when her period started that day, she felt unable to go through with it. The author's frustration is understandable, but his approach of comparing her to other women was the wrong way to handle it. He should have focused on discussing alternatives or showing more empathy instead of making a comparative statement that could be seen as critical.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author might need to apologize for his comment and work on understanding her needs better. The fact that they haven't talked since suggests that the issue is unresolved, and his approach might have been a misstep in addressing his feelings without hurting hers.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The author's comment was hurtful and dismissive, leading to a significant conflict. Therefore, he's likely in the wrong here.\n"
