We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by reading through the situation carefully. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for getting upset with his girlfriend because she doesn't want to go out when she's on her period. \n\nThe key points here are about expectations and communication. The author's girlfriend doesn't go out when she's on her period, especially the first two days. The author planned a special date night, but she canceled because she was on her period that day. He made a comment that he knows other women who don't act like that even during their periods, implying that she could put in more effort for him. She had a very strong negative reaction, leading to a conflict.\n\nFirst, I should consider the context. The author mentions that he's aware periods can be uncomfortable and that his girlfriend is usually laid back. He's been living with her for three months and knows about this pattern. The issue here is that he had a planned date night, which she canceled. He felt justified in his comment because of other women he's known, but his girlfriend took it very badly.\n\nNow, from a general perspective, periods can cause significant discomfort, including cramps, fatigue, and mood swings. Even though some women might push through and go out, it's not fair to expect that everyone will. The author's comment about other women might be dismissive of his girlfriend's experience, making her feel like her pain isn't valid. That could be why she reacted so strongly. She might have felt he was being insensitive or not respecting her physical state.\n\nThe author's approach was passive-aggressive, which can be hurtful. Instead of communicating his feelings openly and discussing how to handle such situations, he made a comparative statement that could be seen as criticizing her. This might have undermined her feelings and made her feel unappreciated. The fact that she locked herself in her room and they haven't talked since shows the impact of his words.\n\nOn the other hand, the author had invested time and effort into planning the date, which is understandable. He might feel frustrated if his plans are being canceled repeatedly. However, the way he expressed his frustration was problematic. It's important to validate a partner's health issues and find a balance between mutual expectations and respect for each other's needs.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author could have discussed his feelings with her without making comparisons to other women. He might need to acknowledge her pain and work together on solutions, like having alternative date ideas that are comfortable for her. Instead of pointing out that others handle it differently, he should focus on understanding her specific situation and supporting her.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's comment was likely hurtful and dismissive. He didn't consider how his words might affect her, leading to a strong negative reaction. Therefore, he is in the wrong for not being supportive and for making a passive-aggressive remark that invalidated her experience. The answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
