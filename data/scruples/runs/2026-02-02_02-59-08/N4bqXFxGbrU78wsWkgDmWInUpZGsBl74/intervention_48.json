We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the user is a guy in a relationship with his girlfriend, and they've been living together for three months. The main issue is that his girlfriend doesn't want to go out when she's on her period. He seems to be trying to understand why she's acting this way, but he also feels upset because she cancels plans, especially a big one where he had reservations and movie tickets. He told her that other women he's known don't act like this, implying she could make more effort. She got really upset, called him names, cried, and they haven't talked since. The user is wondering if he was in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. The girlfriend is described as great, funny, laid-back, and kind, so she's not being unreasonable in general. The author is making an effort to understand her period-related needs, which is a good sign. However, in this specific situation, he made a comment comparing her to other women. That's a red flag. Comparing one's partner to others is often a sensitive topic because it can make the person feel undervalued or not understood. \n\nThe key point here is that the author's girlfriend was in pain and chose to stay home. Even if he had planned a special night, respecting her needs when she's unwell is important. The fact that he had planned this in advance and she knew about it might make him feel let down, but her health and comfort should take precedence. By bringing up that other women don't act like this, he's not only dismissing her experience but also implying that her reaction is excessive. This can be deeply hurtful, especially if her symptoms are genuine and severe. \n\nCramps can vary a lot in intensity, and for some women, they can be debilitating. The author might not fully grasp how bad she's feeling, leading to a lack of empathy. His passive-aggressive comment, even if not angry, could be seen as invalidating her feelings. The girlfriend's strong reaction, including crying and locking herself in her room, shows how much the comment hurt her. \n\nIn relationships, communication and empathy are crucial. Instead of making a comparison, the author could have expressed his disappointment and asked if there was something else they could do together that day. That would show understanding and a willingness to find a solution. By not doing that and instead pointing out her shortcomings compared to others, he likely crossed a line. \n\nThe fact that the girlfriend is usually sweet and kind suggests that her outburst was a result of feeling attacked or not supported. The author's comment might have made her feel like her needs are not being respected, leading to her emotional response. \n\nIn summary, while the author might have had good intentions and was disappointed about the plans, the way he expressed his feelings was hurtful and dismissive. Comparing his girlfriend to others is a classic mistake that can damage trust and feelings in a relationship. So, the answer is likely that he's in the wrong.\n"
