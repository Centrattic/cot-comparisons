We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting upset with his girlfriend because she doesn't want to go out when she's on her period. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The girlfriend cancels plans when she's on her period, which the author has put up with until a recent date night. The author had planned a special evening, but she canceled because her period started that day. He told her that other women he's lived with didn't act like that, implying she could put in more effort. She got extremely upset, called him names, cried, and they haven't talked since. The question is whether he's at fault.\n\nSo, the key points here are about empathy, communication, and understanding. The author's comment about other women is problematic. Comparing his partner to others can be hurtful because it's not about effort but physical and emotional pain. Periods can be very uncomfortable, and the fact that she's canceling plans is a valid reason, not a personal failing. By saying other women don't act this way, he's dismissing her experience and implying she's being unreasonable. That's a classic example of not being supportive and not listening to her needs. \n\nAlso, the fact that she had a strong reaction suggests that his comment hit a nerve. She might feel disrespected or invalidated. Even if he wasn't angry, being passive-aggressive still conveys criticism. He should have approached the situation with more empathy, maybe by asking how she's feeling instead of comparing her to others. \n\nThe bigger issue is communication. Instead of expressing his frustration in a way that blames her, he should have discussed his feelings and found a compromise. For example, maybe they could have rescheduled the plans or done something less strenuous at home. \n\nSo, the author's mistake was not understanding her condition's severity, making a comparison that undermines her pain, and not communicating effectively. Therefore, he's in the wrong. The answer should be A.\n"
