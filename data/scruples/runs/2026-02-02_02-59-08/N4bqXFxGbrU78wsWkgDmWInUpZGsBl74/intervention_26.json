We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author here is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author has a girlfriend they live with, and generally, things are good. The main issue is that when the girlfriend is on her period, especially the first two days, she doesn't want to do anything and cancels plans. The author is okay with this, but there was a specific time when they had a planned date night\u2014dinner and a movie. The author had planned this in advance, and the girlfriend knew about it. However, on that day, she started her period and wanted to cancel. The author then told her, possibly in a passive-aggressive way, that other women he's known don't act like this and that she could put in more effort. The girlfriend reacted extremely negatively, getting angry and crying, and they haven't talked since.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks they are, but wants confirmation. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the author's actions. The key point is the comment about other women. Even if not said angrily, comparing his girlfriend to others and implying she's acting in a way others don't is likely hurtful. The girlfriend's period is a natural biological process, and while it's true that some women might handle it differently, it's not fair to generalize. Each person's experience with their period can vary. The author's statement suggests that his girlfriend's response is excessive compared to others, which could come off as dismissive of her pain or valid need to rest.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction was intense but perhaps understandable. If she's feeling unwell and the author undermines her experience, that could trigger a strong emotional response. Also, the fact that they had planned this in advance, and the author had invested time and effort, but the girlfriend was unwell, there's a conflict between planned activities and health. The author's expectation might be that even when unwell, she should make an effort, but that's not always possible. The author's approach was to make a comparison rather than express empathy or offer support, which is probably why it backfired.\n\nThe author's right to be upset might be valid if they felt their efforts were unappreciated, but the way they expressed it was problematic. Communication is key in relationships, and instead of comparing to others, the author could have discussed their feelings more constructively. The girlfriend's health and comfort should be a priority, and the author's comment may have invalidated her experience, leading to the conflict.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author's comment was dismissive and possibly hurtful. They might not be \"in the wrong\" for feeling upset about canceled plans, but the way they handled the situation was inappropriate. Generalizing about other women and suggesting the girlfriend should act differently isn't supportive. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for the way they communicated their frustration, even if their intention wasn't malicious."
