We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a girlfriend who cancels plans when she's on her period. The author had a special date night planned, which the girlfriend canceled because her period started. The author then made a comment comparing her to other women he's known, which upset her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The girlfriend is experiencing PMS symptoms, which can be physically and emotionally challenging. It's common for women to feel more tired or in pain during this time. The author acknowledges that she's \"usually very funny and laid back,\" so he's aware she's generally a good person, but he's frustrated because she cancels plans unpredictably.\n\nThe key point is the author's comment. He says that other women he's lived with don't act like this during their periods. That's a comparison that could come off as dismissive of her experience. Even if he didn't mean to be angry, making such a comparison might invalidate her feelings. The girlfriend's reaction was a blowout, which suggests that the comment hit a nerve. She felt criticized and judged, which is understandable if she felt her pain wasn't being respected.\n\nThe author planned the date in advance, and the girlfriend knew about it. However, her period is causing her pain, and she's choosing to prioritize her health. The author's frustration is valid, but his approach was to compare her to others, which isn't helpful. It's important to validate her feelings and offer support instead of implying she should be different.\n\nAlso, the girlfriend's reaction of crying and locking herself in her room indicates that the comment was hurtful. The author should have considered her perspective and maybe suggested an alternative plan instead of expressing disappointment in a way that minimized her pain. So, while both have valid feelings, the author's choice of words and comparison likely made things worse. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because his comment was invalidating and hurtful.\n"
