We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again. The author is upset because his girlfriend cancels plans when she's on her period, especially for a planned date night. He told her, in a passive-aggressive way, that other women he's lived with don't act that way, implying she should put in more effort. She got really upset, called him names, and they haven't talked since.\n\nHmm, the key points here are communication and sensitivity. The girlfriend's behavior during her period is causing planned activities to be canceled. The author felt justified in his comment because he compared her to other women he's known. But comparing his current partner to past relationships is a common mistake. It can come off as dismissive of her current feelings and experiences.\n\nThe author mentions that her period is semi-random each month, so maybe he could have planned around it better. But he also says she knew about the plans weeks in advance. However, periods can be unpredictable, so maybe she couldn't have known for sure. The problem is that the author didn't express understanding. Instead, he implied she should behave differently, which is not supportive.\n\nWhen someone is in pain or discomfort, especially with something as common as menstrual cramps, it's important to be empathetic. The author's comment about other women might have made her feel like her experience isn't valid. That could have triggered her emotional outburst. The fact that she locked herself in her room and they haven't talked since shows the impact of his words.\n\nThe author is asking if he was in the wrong. Comparing his current partner to past relationships is a red flag. It's not about whether other women act differently, but about respecting her individual experience. The author's lack of empathy and the passive-aggressive approach likely hurt her feelings. Even if he wasn't angry, the message was that her needs aren't as important as his plans. That's a classic case of not being considerate in a relationship issue. So, yeah, I think the author is in the wrong here.\n"
