We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about the girlfriend not wanting to go out when she's on her period, and the author getting upset about it.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author's girlfriend cancels plans on her period days, which she knows about in advance. The author had a special date night planned, but she canceled because her period started that day. He told her, in a passive-aggressive way, that other women he's known don't act this way. That led to her having a huge emotional reaction.\n\nNow, breaking it down. The author is frustrated because his plans were canceled, especially after planning ahead. But the girlfriend has a valid medical reason\u2014the period can cause cramps and discomfort. He compares her to other women he's lived with, implying she's not making an effort. That's probably where the conflict comes from.\n\nThe main issue here is communication and empathy. The author might not realize that his comments about other women could be minimizing her pain or making her feel judged. Comparing her to others could be hurtful, as everyone's experience with periods is different. The girlfriend's strong reaction suggests that the comment hit a nerve, possibly making her feel unappreciated or criticized for her needs.\n\nAlso, the author had plans that she knew about weeks in advance. If her period started unexpectedly, maybe there was a miscommunication. But even so, his response was to criticize her, which isn't helpful. He should have tried to find a compromise or shown more understanding instead of bringing up past experiences with other women.\n\nIn relationships, support during times of discomfort is important. The author's passive-aggressive comment likely made her feel like her needs were being dismissed. Even if the author felt let down, his approach was flawed. It's about empathy and finding solutions together, not making her feel like she's in the wrong for her body's natural processes.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's comment was probably the trigger. He should have communicated differently, showing more support rather than criticism. That's why the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
