We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about the boyfriend getting upset with his girlfriend because she cancels their plans when she's on her period.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author had planned a special date night, which he had been looking forward to. He mentions that she knows about the plans in advance, but when her period starts, she cancels. He comments that other women he's lived with didn't act like this, suggesting she could put in more effort. She then reacts extremely emotionally, calling him names and crying.\n\nThe key points here are communication, sensitivity, and expectations. The author planned something special, which is understandable. However, commenting on his girlfriend's behavior by comparing her to other women, even passively-aggressively, might be seen as dismissive of her pain. Period symptoms can be severe for some people, and expecting her to push through might not be realistic. The author's frustration is valid, but the way he expressed it\u2014bringing up other women and implying she's not trying hard enough\u2014could be hurtful. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is extreme but not entirely unexpected. Feeling criticized about her health and pain could make her defensive and emotional. The author might not have considered how his words could be perceived as minimizing her experience. Even if he wasn't angry, a passive-aggressive comment can still be damaging. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author could have handled his frustration differently. Instead of making a comparison, maybe he could have asked her how she was feeling or offered support. The fact that they haven't talked since suggests that his comment was a significant breach in their communication. \n\nSo, while the author's feelings about the canceled plans are understandable, his approach was flawed. He might be in the wrong for not being sensitive enough and for using a comparison that could be seen as belittling her situation. Therefore, the answer is A\u2014yes, the author is in the wrong.\n"
