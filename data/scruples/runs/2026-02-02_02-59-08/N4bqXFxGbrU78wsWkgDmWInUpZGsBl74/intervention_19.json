We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a girlfriend not wanting to go out when she's on her period, and the author getting upset, leading to an argument.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the scenario. The girlfriend cancels plans when she's on her period, which the author finds frustrating. The key point is that the author made a comment comparing his current girlfriend to previous women he's lived with, implying she's not trying hard enough. The girlfriend then reacts strongly emotionally.\n\nFrom a relationship perspective, communication is crucial. The author's comment, even if not angry, was passive-aggressive and possibly dismissive of his girlfriend's feelings. Comparing her behavior to others might come off as invalidating her experience. Periods can be very painful for some women, and expecting them to push through when they're not feeling well might be unreasonable. \n\nThe author planned a special date night, which the girlfriend knew about. However, her decision to stay home could be due to genuine discomfort. The author's reaction, even if minor, led to a significant emotional response. This suggests that his comment might have struck a nerve, possibly because she felt judged or not supported.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, he expressed his frustration in a way that compared her to others, which isn't supportive. In a healthy relationship, partners should support each other's needs. The girlfriend's reaction indicates that the comment hurt her feelings, implying that the author's approach was inappropriate. \n\nTherefore, the author might be in the wrong because he didn't validate her feelings and made a comparison that could be seen as critical. The answer is likely A (yes).\n"
