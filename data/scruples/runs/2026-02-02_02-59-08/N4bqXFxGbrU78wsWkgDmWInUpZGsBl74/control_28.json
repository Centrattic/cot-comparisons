We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario (the author) is at fault. The situation involves the author getting upset with his girlfriend because she cancels their plans when she's on her period.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The girlfriend is described as someone who, during the first two days of her period, doesn't want to do anything. She cancels plans and just stays on the couch. The author has tried to be understanding, mentioning that he knows women get cramps and stuff. But in this specific instance, he had planned a special date night weeks in advance, and she canceled it because she got her period that day. He told her that other women he's known don't act like this, implying she could put in more effort. This led to her becoming extremely upset, angry, and crying.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics here. The author's intention might have been to express his frustration, but the way he did it was passive-aggressive. He compared his current girlfriend to others he's had, suggesting she's not making enough effort. That's a classic red flag because it's a form of invalidation. When someone is in pain or unwell, especially with something as common as menstrual cramps, expecting them to push through and act normally can be unreasonable.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction, while intense, might be a result of feeling criticized or not supported. If she's already in pain and feeling down, being told that others don't act this way could make her feel like a burden. The author's comment about other women could also be a trigger, making her feel like she's not being respected as an individual. \n\nAnother angle is communication. The author didn't address his feelings directly or compassionately. Instead of expressing his disappointment in a way that acknowledges her situation, he made a comparative statement that could be hurtful. Good communication involves understanding both parties' perspectives. He might have needed to express his feelings without invalidating hers.\n\nAlso, the girlfriend's behavior of staying home during her period isn't uncommon. While it's important to support someone who's unwell, it's also about mutual respect. However, the author's approach here was to criticize her, which is not supportive. Even if he was upset about canceled plans, the way he communicated his frustration was inappropriate.\n\nIn relationships, it's crucial to validate each other's experiences. The author's comment about other women sets up a comparison that's not helpful. It's possible he didn't realize how hurtful that could be. His actions show a lack of empathy in that moment. \n\nSo putting it all together: the author is in the wrong because he invalidated his girlfriend's feelings and needs, used a hurtful comparison, and didn't communicate his disappointment constructively. His actions led to a breakdown in communication and hurt feelings. The responsibility here is on him to apologize and find a way to discuss future plans that accommodate both their needs better, perhaps by being more flexible or finding alternative ways to spend time together when she's not feeling well.\n"
