We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for getting upset with his girlfriend because she doesn't want to go out when she's on her period. \n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The girlfriend experiences severe period symptoms where she can't do anything, even canceling plans. The author planned a special date night, but she couldn't go through with it because her period started. He made a comment comparing her to other women he's lived with, implying she should put in more effort. She got extremely upset, leading to a major argument.\n\nSo, the key points here are: 1) the girlfriend's health and well-being during her period, 2) the author's expectation for her to participate despite her condition, and 3) the way he communicated his frustration, which was passive-aggressive and comparative.\n\nFrom a relationship perspective, empathy is crucial. The author acknowledges that women get cramps, but then expects her to push through. Even if he's tried to be understanding, bringing up other women in a way that suggests she's not measuring up could be hurtful. Comparing partners to others is generally a bad idea because it can make someone feel inadequate. \n\nAlso, the fact that she had known about the plans weeks in advance but still couldn't make it implies that her symptoms are severe enough that even planning around them isn't feasible. The author might not realize how debilitating her period is. His frustration is understandable, but his approach was dismissive of her needs and feelings. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction was intense, which might indicate that she felt criticized or not supported. The author's comment about other women not acting like this could have made her feel like her pain isn't valid. In relationships, communication should be about understanding and support, not comparisons or expectations that don't consider the other person's health.\n\nSo, putting this together, the author's actions were inconsiderate, even if his intention wasn't to be cruel. He should have approached the situation with more empathy and found another way to express his feelings without belittling her experience. Therefore, he's likely in the wrong here.\n"
