We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting upset with his girlfriend because she cancels plans when she's on her period. \n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The author mentions that his girlfriend doesn't want to go out during her period, especially the first two days. He had planned a date night in advance, but she canceled. He told her that other women he's known don't act like this, implying she could put more effort in. She got extremely upset, angry, and they haven't talked since.\n\nSo, the key points here. The author is frustrated because his plans are canceled, and he's comparing his girlfriend to others. The girlfriend's reaction was intense, which suggests he might have crossed a line. \n\nIn relationships, communication and empathy are crucial. Menstrual cramps can be really painful for some women, and it's not fair to compare one person's experience to another's. The author's comment about other women not acting that way could be seen as dismissive of her pain. Even if he's not angry, the passive-aggressive remark might have invalidated her feelings. \n\nAlso, the fact that she locked herself in her room and cried shows that his words hurt her deeply. Even if the author's intention was to express his disappointment, the way he did it was hurtful. The girlfriend's reaction indicates that she felt criticized or judged for her condition. \n\nSo, the author's main mistake was not being supportive and instead making a comparison that undermined her experience. He should have addressed his feelings in a more understanding and compassionate way. Therefore, he's in the wrong here. The answer should be A.\n"
