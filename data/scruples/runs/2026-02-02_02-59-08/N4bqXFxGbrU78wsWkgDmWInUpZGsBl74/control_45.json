We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a girlfriend not wanting to go out when on her period, and the author got upset and made a comment about other women.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The girlfriend has periods that make her stay home, which the author usually accepts. But this time, they had a planned date, and she canceled. The author told her that other women don't act this way, implying she should make an effort. She got really angry and they haven't talked since.\n\nSo, is the author at fault? Well, the author's main issue is expecting his girlfriend to go out despite her period. The girlfriend has a medical reason to feel unwell. The author's comment about other women might be dismissive of her feelings. Even if he's not angry, passive-aggressive remarks can come off as hurtful. The girlfriend's severe reaction suggests that his words were perceived as invalidating her experience. It's important to consider that everyone's pain and symptoms vary, and comparing her to others isn't helpful. The author might not be wrong entirely, but his approach was probably not considerate enough. In relationships, communication and empathy are key. By making that comment, he might have overstepped, even if his intention was to express frustration. So, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because he undermined her needs and reacted in a way that caused harm.\n"
