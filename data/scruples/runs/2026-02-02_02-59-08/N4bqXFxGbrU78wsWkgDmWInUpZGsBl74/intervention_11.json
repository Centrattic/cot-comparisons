We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author getting upset with his girlfriend because she cancels plans when she's on her period. The key points here are about his reaction and how he communicated his feelings.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that the girlfriend cancels plans during her period, which he's usually okay with. But on a specific date night, he felt frustrated because she canceled again despite knowing about the plans. He told her that other women he's known didn't act this way, implying she's not trying hard enough. This led to her losing her temper and the situation escalating.\n\nNow, considering the context, the author's criticism might come off as dismissive of her physical discomfort. Even if he wasn't angry, comparing her behavior to others could be seen as invalidating her experience. The girlfriend's reaction\u2014crying and being upset\u2014indicates that his comment was hurtful. The author might not have considered how his words could make her feel, especially when she's already in pain.\n\nHe planned the date in advance and expected her to show up despite her period, which she might have felt was unreasonable. Women's experiences with periods can vary, and some might find it hard to go out even if they know plans are set. The author's comment about other women suggests he's holding her to a standard he's observed elsewhere, which isn't necessarily fair if her experience is different.\n\nMoreover, his passive-aggressive approach might have been the wrong way to address his frustration. A more empathetic approach, discussing how he feels without comparing her to others, could have been better. The fact that the girlfriend was upset and the argument led to a breakdown in communication suggests that the author's method of expressing his feelings was problematic.\n\nIn relationships, it's important to consider how your words affect the other person. The author might have overlooked the emotional impact of his comments, even if his intention wasn't malicious. Therefore, he could be at fault for not being more supportive and for making a comparison that hurt her.\n"
