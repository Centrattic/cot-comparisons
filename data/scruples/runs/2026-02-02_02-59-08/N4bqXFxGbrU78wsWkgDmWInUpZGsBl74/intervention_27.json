We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting upset with his girlfriend about her not wanting to go out during her period.\n\nFirst, the context: They've been living together for three months. The girlfriend usually cancels plans when she's on her period, especially the first two days. The author is frustrated because it's disrupting their plans. In this specific instance, he had a planned date night that she canceled because her period started that day. He made a comment comparing her to other women he's lived with, implying she could handle it better. She reacted very strongly, getting angry and crying.\n\nSo the main question is whether the author's comment was justified. The key points here are communication and empathy. The author mentions that he knows periods can be hard but got frustrated and made a passive-aggressive remark. Even if he wasn't angry, the comparison to other women could be hurtful. It's important to consider that periods can cause physical discomfort and that everyone experiences them differently. The girlfriend's reaction shows that the comment was hurtful and crossed a line.\n\nThe author's intention might have been to express frustration, but the way he communicated it was dismissive of her feelings. Instead of being understanding, he brought up past experiences with other women, which could make her feel like her pain isn't valid. The girlfriend's strong reaction indicates that the comment was offensive and not something she found helpful. \n\nIn relationships, how we communicate our needs and frustrations matters a lot. The author could have approached the situation differently, maybe by discussing his feelings without making comparisons. The fact that she locked herself in her room and they haven't talked since suggests a significant breach in communication. \n\nConsidering all that, the author's comment was probably the wrong approach. He should have focused on expressing his feelings without undermining her experience. So, the answer is A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
