We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for getting upset with his girlfriend because she doesn't want to go out when she's on her period. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author and his girlfriend have been living together for three months, and she's generally great. The issue is that during her period, especially the first two days, she cancels plans and wants to stay home. He's upset because he had a special date night planned, which she canceled when her period started. He made a comment comparing her to other women he's lived with, implying she could put in more effort. This led to her getting extremely upset, yelling, crying, and them not talking since.\n\nNow, the key points here. The author had planned a special date in advance, and she knew about it. However, on that day, she started her period and didn't feel up to going out. The author's response was to make a passive-aggressive comment about other women being better at handling periods. His girlfriend reacted strongly, which surprised him.\n\nFrom a general perspective, periods can cause physical and emotional discomfort, and it's common for women to feel more tired or in pain during those days. The author's frustration is understandable, but his approach of comparing her to others might have been hurtful. Even if he wasn't angry, the passive-aggressive comment could make her feel judged or criticized, especially when she's already in pain. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction suggests that the comment was deeply offensive to her. It's possible she felt he was invalidating her pain or implying she wasn't trying hard enough. Even if he had planned something for her, the way he expressed his disappointment might have been the main issue. The fact that she locked herself in her room and they haven't talked since indicates that the comment caused significant hurt.\n\nIn terms of whether the author is in the wrong, the comparison he made is problematic. Telling someone they should handle their symptoms better when they're already feeling unwell can be seen as dismissive. It's important to acknowledge their feelings and offer support rather than suggesting they should push through discomfort. The author's approach was not supportive and could be seen as insensitive, even if his intention wasn't to be cruel.\n\nHowever, there's a middle ground. The author had legitimate feelings of disappointment because his plans were canceled. But instead of expressing that disappointment in a way that compares her negatively to others, he could have communicated his feelings more constructively. The fact that he wasn't angry but passive-aggressive might not mitigate the harm caused by the comment.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author's comment, while perhaps not meant to be harsh, was unhelpful and hurtful. The girlfriend's strong reaction is a sign that the comment crossed a line. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong for making that comparison, even if his intentions were just to express frustration.\n"
