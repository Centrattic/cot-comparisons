We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about the author getting upset with his girlfriend because she doesn't want to go out when she's on her period.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author planned a special date night, but the girlfriend canceled because she was on her period. He told her that other women he's known don't act like that, implying she should make more effort. She got really upset and angry.\n\nSo, the main issue here is the author's response. He's comparing his current girlfriend to others he's had, suggesting she's not handling her period as well. That's probably the trigger. Even if he wasn't angry, saying it passively-aggressively could be hurtful. The girlfriend's reaction was extreme, but maybe he overstepped by bringing up other women, which can be a sensitive topic.\n\nFrom a relationship standpoint, communication is key. The author might not realize how his words could make her feel judged or inadequate. Even if his intention was to express frustration, the way he phrased it could come across as dismissive of her pain or needs. It's important to validate her feelings rather than compare her to others.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that her periods come at random times, so maybe there's a medical reason she's not feeling well. It's possible she's dealing with more severe cramps or other symptoms that aren't just typical. Assuming she can just \"push through\" without understanding her specific situation might be part of the problem.\n\nThe girlfriend locking herself in her room and not talking since is a sign of deep hurt. The author might need to take responsibility for his words, apologize, and try to understand her perspective better. Comparing past partners can create insecurity and resentment, even if it's not the intention.\n\nIn relationships, it's crucial to support each other's needs. If the author expects her to go out despite her discomfort, he should also consider how he can support her during that time, rather than just expecting her to push through. Maybe there's a middle ground they can find together, like a more relaxed activity at home that both can enjoy.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's comment about other women likely crossed a line, making the girlfriend feel criticized. Even if his frustration is understandable, the way he expressed it was hurtful. Therefore, he's in the wrong for making that comparison instead of addressing the situation with empathy.\n"
