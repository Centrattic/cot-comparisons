We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The situation is about a guy who got upset with his girlfriend because she canceled their date night when she was on her period. He planned in advance, knew about her period, but she still canceled. He compared her to other women he's lived with before, implying she's being overly sensitive. She got really upset, yelled at him, and they haven't talked since.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author made a passive-aggressive comment comparing his girlfriend to other women, suggesting she could have put in more effort. The girlfriend had her period, which she's been known to be unwell for the first two days. The author had plans that she canceled, which she knew about in advance. She had her period on that day and decided to stay home.\n\nNow, the main issue is about respecting her needs. Periods can be really painful for some people, and even if others don't act that way, it's her body. The author's comment about other women might come across as dismissive of her experience. Even if he meant it as a gentle nudge, it could be seen as invalidating her feelings. The girlfriend's reaction was intense, but maybe because she felt disrespected or that her pain wasn't acknowledged.\n\nThe author had planned the night, which is understandable, but maybe he should have considered that despite her knowing about the plans, her period might affect her that day. He might have thought she could push through, but that's not always possible. Comparing her to other women isn't helpful and can make her feel like her experience isn't valid.\n\nSo, even though the author might have felt frustrated, the way he communicated his feelings was not supportive. He should have approached it with empathy instead of making a passive-aggressive remark. The girlfriend's reaction, while intense, might stem from feeling that her needs weren't respected. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because he dismissed her valid health issue and compared her to others in a way that undermined her experience.\n"
