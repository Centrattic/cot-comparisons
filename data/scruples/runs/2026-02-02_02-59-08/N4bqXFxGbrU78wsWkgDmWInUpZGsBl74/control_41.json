We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for getting upset with his girlfriend because she cancels their plans when she's on her period. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author and his girlfriend have been living together for three months. She usually has periods that make her stay home for the first two days. He's been patient, but there was a specific date night he planned, which she canceled. He mentioned other women he's lived with didn't act this way, which led her to get extremely angry, call him names, and they haven't talked since.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author's expectations vs. his girlfriend's needs during her period. He planned a special date, which she canceled. He made a passive-aggressive comment comparing her to other women. She reacted strongly emotionally.\n\nNow, considering cultural and social norms. Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) and menstrual cramps can affect people differently. It's not uncommon for some women to feel unwell during their period. However, every individual's experience varies. The author's frustration comes from her canceling plans despite knowing about them in advance. But his comparison to other women might be dismissive of her personal experience.\n\nCommunication is a big factor here. The author didn't express his feelings directly; instead, he used passive-aggressive remarks. That's a problem because it can come off as judgmental. He might not have considered that his girlfriend's feelings might be more intense this time, or that his comment hurt her.\n\nAlso, the girlfriend's reaction\u2014losing her temper and crying\u2014suggests that his comment hit a sensitive spot. Maybe she felt criticized or undervalued. She might have felt that he was invalidating her pain or implying she wasn't trying hard enough. His comment about other women could be seen as minimizing her experience, making her feel like she's failing in the relationship.\n\nFrom a relational perspective, when one partner has health or discomfort issues, the other should support them. However, both need to communicate their needs. The author's frustration is understandable, but how he expressed it was inappropriate. He should have discussed his feelings without belittling her experience.\n\nThe author could have approached it by expressing his desire to spend time with her while acknowledging her discomfort. Instead, he made a passive-aggressive comment that led to conflict. Therefore, the problem here is his method of communication and the judgmental tone, not necessarily the fact that he felt upset.\n\nIn summary, the author is in the wrong because his response was dismissive and passive-aggressive, which hurt his girlfriend and caused a significant argument. He should have communicated his feelings in a more constructive and empathetic way.\n"
