We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for getting upset with his girlfriend because she cancels plans when she's on her period.\n\nFirst, I need to look at both sides. The girlfriend is dealing with menstrual cramps and discomfort, which is a legitimate health issue. Many women experience severe pain during their periods, and it's common for them to need rest or avoid social activities. The author mentions that she usually cancels plans during those days, so it's a recurring issue.\n\nThe key point here is the author's comment about other women not acting that way. Comparing his current girlfriend to others implies that her reaction is abnormal or excessive. Even if other women have different experiences or coping mechanisms, it's not fair to judge based on that. Everyone's pain tolerance and how they manage their symptoms can vary.\n\nAlso, the author planned a special date night that the girlfriend had known about in advance. However, her period started that day, and she had to cancel. While the author had put effort into planning, the girlfriend's health and well-being are important. The author's frustration is understandable, but the way he expressed it\u2014by bringing up comparisons to other women\u2014was likely hurtful and dismissive of her feelings.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction (crying, yelling, locking herself in) suggests that the author's words were deeply offensive. The comment about other women might have made her feel invalidated or not supported during a time when she's already struggling. It's possible she felt he was minimizing her pain or expecting her to push through despite her discomfort.\n\nIn relationships, communication and support are crucial. Even if the author felt overlooked, the approach he took was not empathetic. Instead of expressing his feelings about the canceled plans, he made a judgmental comparison. That's where the mistake lies. The right approach would be to discuss how to handle such situations together, maybe finding alternatives or supporting her during her period days.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author is in the wrong (A) because he invalidated his girlfriend's experience and used a comparison that hurt her feelings, rather than showing understanding and support.\n"
