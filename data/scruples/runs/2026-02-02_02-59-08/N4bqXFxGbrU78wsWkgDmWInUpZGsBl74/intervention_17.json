We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the person is asking if they're in the wrong for getting upset with their girlfriend because she doesn't want to go out when she's on her period. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the situation. The girlfriend is on her period for the first two days and refuses to do anything, even canceling plans. The author planned a special date night, but she had her period that day and wanted to stay home. The author then told her that other women he's lived with didn't act like that, even on their periods, implying she could put in more effort. That led to the girlfriend being really upset, yelling, crying, and not talking to him since.\n\nHmm, so the key here is the author's comment about other women. Comparing his current partner to past ones is a red flag. Even if it's not said angrily, bringing up past relationships or implying she's different from others can be hurtful. The girlfriend's reaction suggests that this comment really hit a nerve. Maybe she felt disrespected or that her pain wasn't being acknowledged.\n\nPMS or menstrual cramps can be really severe for some women, and it's not just about being lazy. The author might not realize how painful it is or how it affects her ability to function. But instead of being supportive, he questioned her effort, which could be seen as dismissive. \n\nAlso, the fact that she locked herself in her room and they haven't talked since shows that this was a big emotional hit. The author's approach was passive-aggressive, which isn't healthy communication. He didn't address the issue directly or with empathy. Instead, he made a comparison that she might take as a criticism of her as a partner.\n\nSo, even if he was trying to express frustration, the way he did it was harmful. He could have communicated his feelings better, like expressing that he was disappointed but understanding her pain. Instead, he generalized past experiences, which might not be relevant, and made her feel like she's not being taken seriously. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. Blaming or comparing partners can lead to resentment. The author's comment was probably the main issue here. He should have tried to understand her situation more and found a compromise, rather than making her feel bad for her natural reaction to pain.\n"
