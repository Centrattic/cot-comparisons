We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about a girlfriend who cancels plans when she's on her period, and the author expresses frustration, leading to a big argument.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author's girlfriend doesn't want to go out during her period, especially the first two days. He's upset because she cancels plans, even when they're pre-arranged. In this specific case, he had a special date night planned, and she bailed, leading him to make a passive-aggressive comment comparing her to other women he's known. The girlfriend reacted extremely angrily, leading to a rift.\n\nThe main question is whether the author is in the wrong. From a general perspective, periods can cause physical discomfort, and it's common for people to feel unwell during that time. However, the author's approach here seems problematic. He acknowledges that women experience cramps but still expects her to put more effort. By comparing her to other women he's lived with, he's implying that her reaction is excessive or not justified, which could be dismissive of her feelings and the physical pain she's experiencing.\n\nEven if he didn't mean to be confrontational, the passive-aggressive comment about other women not acting this way could come off as invalidating. Partners need to support each other during times of discomfort. Instead of expressing his disappointment in a way that might make her feel criticized, he could have communicated his feelings more constructively. The fact that she reacted so strongly suggests that his words hurt her deeply, possibly making her feel unappreciated or not understood.\n\nMoreover, the author had known about the plans weeks in advance, and she had the chance to communicate if she needed to cancel earlier. However, the crux is how he handled the situation. His comment, even if not shouted, was a judgment about her behavior, which likely triggered her emotional response. It's important to validate her experience rather than comparing it to others. So, in this context, the author's approach was likely wrong because he didn't support her during a difficult time and instead criticized her, leading to the conflict.\n"
