We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The situation is that the author planned a special date night with his girlfriend, but when she started her period, she canceled everything and stayed home. He got upset, told her that other women he's known don't act like this, and she had a huge emotional reaction.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is clearly frustrated because he had plans and invested time and effort into the date. He felt let down and maybe even disrespected. But the girlfriend is dealing with her period, which can be physically uncomfortable and sometimes cause mood swings. She might feel that her needs are being ignored or criticized.\n\nThe author's comment about other women is problematic. Even if it's true that other women don't cancel plans when on their period, bringing that up is a comparison that can come off as dismissive of her current feelings and situation. It's a form of passive-aggressive communication, which can be hurtful. He might not have meant to be harsh, but the content of his message was.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction was intense, but emotional responses can be heightened during or after a period due to hormonal changes. The fact that she locked herself in her room and they haven't talked since shows how hurt she was. The author's comment likely made her feel criticized and invalidated, which is a common trigger for emotional outbursts.\n\nAlso, the author's approach to the situation is important. Instead of expressing his feelings directly and seeking a compromise, he used a comparison that could be seen as blaming her. A better approach might have been to express his feelings of disappointment while acknowledging her discomfort, then discussing how to handle future plans.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author's message, even if not shouted, still conveys a judgment. The girlfriend might have felt that her needs for rest and comfort were being prioritized over his plans, but the way he addressed it was not constructive. He should have tried to understand her perspective rather than making a comparison.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the author did say something that hurt her and contributed to the conflict. Therefore, he's in the wrong.\n"
