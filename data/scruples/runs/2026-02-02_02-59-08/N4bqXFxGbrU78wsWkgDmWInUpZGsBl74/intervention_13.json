We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the question is in the wrong. The situation is that the author got upset with his girlfriend for not going out when she's on her period. They had a planned date night, but she canceled because of her period. The author suggested that other women he's known don't act like that, implying his girlfriend should try harder. She got really upset and they haven't talked since.\n\nFirst, the author's main issue is that his girlfriend cancels plans during her period. He mentions she's usually laid back and they've been living together for three months. The problem is the period-related cancellations, which he's trying to schedule around but she can't. The key point here is the author's comment about other women not acting that way. That seems like a comparison that could be hurtful. Comparing her to others, even if it's not directly, might make her feel inadequate or not valued.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction was intense\u2014calling him names, crying, and locking herself in her room. That suggests that the author's words hit a nerve. Maybe she felt criticized or dismissed about her pain. Periods can be really tough, and comparing her to others might minimize her experience. Even if he didn't mean it angrily, the passive-aggressive comment could be seen as invalidating her needs.\n\nAlso, the author planned the date night weeks in advance, which is a big deal. However, expecting her to go out despite her period might not consider her physical discomfort. On the other hand, maybe there's a middle ground, like rescheduling or adjusting the plans. But the way he approached it by bringing up other women is problematic. It's not about right or wrong, but communication. He could have discussed it more empathetically instead of making her feel like she's not trying hard enough.\n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong because his comment was hurtful and dismissive of her situation. Even if he's frustrated, the way he expressed it led to a major conflict. The girlfriend's reaction shows that his words were particularly damaging. Therefore, the answer is likely A\u2014author is in the wrong.\n"
