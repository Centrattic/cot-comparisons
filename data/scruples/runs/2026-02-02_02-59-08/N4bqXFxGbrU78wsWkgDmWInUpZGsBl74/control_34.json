We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong based on the given scenario. Let me read through the situation carefully.\n\nSo, the author's girlfriend cancels plans when she's on her period, which the author has been tolerating. But this time, after making special date plans weeks in advance, the author gets upset and comments that other women he's known don't act this way. The girlfriend reacts angrily, leading to a breakdown in communication. The author is now questioning if he's at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The girlfriend is experiencing period-related discomfort, which can be physically and emotionally taxing. It's common for women to have symptoms like cramps, fatigue, or mood changes during their period, affecting their ability to engage in plans. The author has been patient up to this point, but this incident was after a planned date she canceled.\n\nThe key point here is the author's comment about other women. By bringing up that he's lived with other women who didn't act this way, he's implying that his girlfriend should be doing more. This comparison can be hurtful and dismissive of her current experience. Even if he didn't mean to be confrontational, the statement likely felt invalidating. People generally don't appreciate being compared to others, especially regarding health and personal experiences.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction, while intense, isn't uncommon in such situations. Feeling criticized for something beyond her control (period symptoms) can lead to emotional outbursts. The author, on the other hand, might have been feeling frustrated after making an effort for a date that was canceled. However, the way he expressed his frustration may have been inappropriate.\n\nIt's important to note that everyone's experience with menstruation varies. What one woman can handle, another might not. The author's expectation that she should put in more effort, without considering her specific situation, shows a lack of empathy. The fact that he mentions planning weeks in advance and she knew about the date is a factor. But she was still unwell when the day came, which is beyond her control.\n\nIn relationships, communication and empathy are crucial. The author's passive-aggressive comment, even if not shouted, was a criticism that crossed a line. The girlfriend's anger and emotional response indicate that she felt disrespected or misunderstood. The author should have approached the situation with more compassion, perhaps discussing how to handle future plans when she's unwell, rather than making a comparison.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's comment was hurtful and didn't consider his girlfriend's feelings or her health. He expected her to perform despite her symptoms, which is unreasonable. Therefore, he's likely at fault here.\n"
