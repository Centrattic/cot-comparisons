We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a couple where the girlfriend avoids going out when she's on her period, and the author got upset about it.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that his girlfriend is usually great but that her period causes her to cancel plans. He plans a special date night, but she cancels it because she's on her period. He expresses his frustration by comparing her to other women he's lived with who don't act that way, which leads to a big argument.\n\nHmm, from what I know, period cramps can be really painful for some people. It's not just a matter of \"putting in more effort.\" The author's comment about other women might be dismissive of her actual pain. Even if he's not angry, saying that others don't act that way could be seen as invalidating her experience. \n\nAlso, he had planned this in advance and she knew about it. But maybe she had a really bad period that week. The author's response was passive-aggressive, which might not be the best way to handle it. She reacted strongly because she felt criticized, which makes sense if she's in pain and feels her needs aren't respected.\n\nThe key here is whether his comment was inconsiderate. By bringing up other women, he might have made her feel like her pain isn't valid. Even if he's trying to understand, the way he expressed it could have been hurtful. The girlfriend's reaction shows that the comment hit a nerve, which is a sign that he might have been inconsiderate.\n\nSo, I think the author is in the wrong because he didn't validate her experience and made a comparison that could be seen as dismissive. Answer A.\n"
