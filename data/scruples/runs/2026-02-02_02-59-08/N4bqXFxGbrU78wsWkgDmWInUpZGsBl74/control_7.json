We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting upset with his girlfriend because she doesn't want to go out when she's on her period. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The girlfriend experiences severe period symptoms where she can't leave the house for the first two days. The author planned a special date night, but she canceled because she was on her period. He mentioned other women he's lived with didn't act like this, which led to her getting extremely upset.\n\nSo, the key points here are about empathy and communication. Periods can cause significant discomfort, and it's not just about 'making an effort'. The author's comment about other women implies that his girlfriend is being unreasonable, which can come off as dismissive of her pain. Even if he's not angry, comparing her to others in this context is hurtful.\n\nAlso, the timing of the date being planned weeks in advance and her being aware doesn't change the fact that her health issue is beyond her control. The author's frustration is understandable, but his approach wasn't considerate. He should have been more understanding and maybe adjusted plans instead of expressing frustration through passive-aggressive remarks.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction, while intense, might stem from feeling criticized and not supported during a time she's already struggling. The author's comment could be seen as invalidating her experience. In healthy relationships, partners support each other through health issues, and expecting someone in pain to make an effort can be unfair.\n\nTherefore, the author is in the wrong because he dismissed her legitimate health concerns and compared her to others, which is not helpful. He should focus on communication and flexibility rather than frustration.\n"
