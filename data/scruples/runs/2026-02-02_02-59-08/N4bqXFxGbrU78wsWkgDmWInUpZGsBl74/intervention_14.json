We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the scenario again.\n\nThe author's girlfriend doesn't want to go out when she's on her period, especially the first two days. They live together, and the author is usually okay with this. But there was a specific date night he planned weeks in advance, which got canceled because she started her period that day. The author told her, in a passive-aggressive way, that other women he's lived with don't act this way, implying she should put in more effort. The girlfriend reacted extremely negatively, got angry, cried, and they haven't talked since. The author is now wondering if he was wrong.\n\nHmm. So the key points here are about communication, expectations, and sensitivity. The author's girlfriend is clearly dealing with period cramps, which can be very painful. The author planned a special date, which he probably put a lot of effort into. However, his comment about other women he's lived with not acting this way seems dismissive of her feelings and possibly minimizing her pain. Comparing her to others is often a bad move because it can come off as invalidating.\n\nEven if the author didn't say it angrily, the passive-aggressive tone could still be hurtful. The girlfriend's reaction was intense, which might indicate that the comment hit a nerve. Maybe she felt criticized for her pain or that her needs weren't being considered. The author might not have considered how his words could make her feel, especially during a time when she's already in discomfort.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might feel that he's being unfair if she's consistently canceling plans without trying to make alternatives. But the way he approached the issue was probably not constructive. Instead of expressing his feelings about the canceled plans and seeking a compromise, he made a comparison that could be seen as disrespectful.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author likely crossed a line by dismissing her experience with her period. Even if his intention was to encourage her to make an effort, the way he communicated it was harmful. The girl's strong reaction shows that the comment was deeply upsetting. Therefore, the author is in the wrong here.\n"
