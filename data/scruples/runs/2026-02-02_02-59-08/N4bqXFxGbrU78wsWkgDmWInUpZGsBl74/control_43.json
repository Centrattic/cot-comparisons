We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here.\n\nSo the situation is the guy is upset because his girlfriend cancels plans when she's on her period. He planned a special date night, but she had her period and canceled. He told her that he's seen other women not act like that during their periods, implying she should put in more effort. She got really angry and upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend is on her period, which can cause physical discomfort, cramps, and emotional changes. It's a common experience, but everyone's experience varies. The author acknowledges that she's usually laid back and great, but this is a recurring issue. \n\nThe key issue here is the author's response. He made a comparison to other women, which can be hurtful. Even if he didn't mean it to be, pointing out that others don't act the same way can invalidate her feelings. That's a common trigger for conflict because it makes the person feel their experience isn't respected. \n\nAlso, he had planned this in advance, which is great, but maybe he didn't consider that her period might be unpredictable. However, he knew about her periods and tried to schedule around it before. The problem here is the specific instance where he expressed frustration, even passively-aggressively. \n\nCommunication is important. Instead of comparing her to others, he should have discussed his feelings without judgment. By saying others don't act like this, he might have made her feel disbelieved or dismissed. \n\nHer reaction was intense, which suggests that his comment hit a nerve. Even if he didn't mean to be harsh, the message that she's not trying hard enough could be seen as blaming her for her physical condition. \n\nSo, the author's mistake was not in being upset about canceled plans, but in how he communicated his feelings. Using a comparison to other women was a poor choice and likely the main reason she reacted so strongly. \n\nTherefore, the author is in the wrong because his comment was disrespectful and dismissive of her experience, leading to a harsh reaction.\n"
