We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about the girlfriend not wanting to go out when she's on her period, and the author getting upset because she cancels plans. They had a special date night that she bailed on, and he made a comment comparing her to other women he's lived with, which led to her getting really upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author planned something special, which the girlfriend knew about in advance. She canceled because she was on her period. He then told her that other women he's known don't act this way and implied she should put in more effort. The girlfriend reacted strongly, leading to a conflict.\n\nThe key points here are about empathy and communication. The author might feel frustrated because his plans were canceled, but he should consider that the girlfriend is dealing with physical discomfort. However, his comment about other women could come off as dismissive of her feelings and invalidates her experience. That's probably why she got so upset. He didn't approach it with understanding but instead compared her to others, which can be hurtful.\n\nEven if his intention wasn't to be aggressive, the way he phrased it was passive-aggressive and judgmental. It's important in relationships to validate each other's feelings. By bringing up other women, he might have made her feel like she's being judged or compared negatively. That's a common trigger for defensiveness.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend could have communicated better if she felt her needs weren't being met, but the author's approach here was not constructive. He should have tried to understand her situation rather than make a comparison. His frustration is valid, but his method of expressing it was flawed.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author's actions directly led to the conflict. He could have expressed his feelings without invalidating her. The answer here would likely be A, the author is in the wrong because his comment was hurtful and dismissive of her experience with her period.\n"
