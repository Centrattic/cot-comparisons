We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. So the user is asking if the author of this \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author got upset with his girlfriend because she canceled their special date night because she was on her period. He plans this weeks in advance, but she cancels last minute. He comments that he's seen other women handle periods without canceling, so he's a bit upset. She then gets really angry and they haven't talked since.\n\nHmm, so first, I need to analyze the situation. The key points here are communication and empathy. The author planned something special, which he had invested time and effort into. On the other hand, the girlfriend is dealing with her period, which is a time when she's feeling unwell. She cancels the plans, and the author responds by comparing her to other women he's lived with, implying she's not trying hard enough.\n\nWait, the author's comment about other women not acting like this during their periods is problematic. It's not just about the period itself, but how he's framing his girlfriend's reaction. Every person's experience with their period can be different. What might be manageable for one person could be debilitating for another. By bringing up other women, he might be invalidating her feelings and pain. That could be a big trigger for her to get so upset.\n\nAlso, the author waited until she came home from work, had dinner reservations, and movie tickets. He planned this in advance, but maybe he didn't consider that her period might start earlier than expected. Even though he knew about the period, maybe there's a lack of communication about how she's feeling closer to the date. Perhaps he could have checked in with her that day instead of assuming she'd be okay.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is intense, but her crying and locking herself in the room suggests deep hurt. The author's comment about other women could have made her feel judged or not supported. It's possible she felt that he didn't respect her needs or that he was dismissing her pain. Even if he didn't mean it angrily, the passive-aggressive comment still conveyed criticism.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author was wrong. From a relationship perspective, empathy and understanding are crucial. Comparing partners to others, especially in a context where one is unwell, is a common relationship mistake. The author's frustration is understandable, but his response was not supportive. He should have communicated more compassionately and perhaps adjusted plans if needed, rather than making a comparison that could be seen as dismissive.\n\nIn conclusion, the author is likely in the wrong because he invalidated his girlfriend's experience and made a judgmental comparison. The answer should be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
