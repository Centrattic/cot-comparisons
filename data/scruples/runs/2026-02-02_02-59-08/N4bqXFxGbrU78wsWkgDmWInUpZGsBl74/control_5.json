We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting upset with his girlfriend because she doesn't want to go out when she's on her period.\n\nFirst, the author's girlfriend has severe symptoms during her period, making her stay home even when there are plans. The author planned a special date night weeks in advance, but she couldn't make it. He comments that other women he's known don't act this way, implying she should put in more effort. That led to a huge argument.\n\nSo, the key here is understanding both perspectives. The girlfriend is dealing with physical discomfort, which is a valid medical issue. PMS and menstrual cramps can be really debilitating. The author's frustration is understandable because he put in effort for a date. However, his approach was to compare her to other women, which can be hurtful. It's not about whether she should push through, but how he communicated his feelings.\n\nComparing her to others is a classic toxic move because it invalidates her experience. Even if done passively-aggressively, it's a trigger for many people. The girlfriend's reaction shows that his words deeply hurt her, leading to a breakdown in communication. The author didn't acknowledge her pain or validate her feelings, which is a big part of being in a relationship.\n\nOn the flip side, the author's frustration isn't entirely unfounded. Relationships require compromise, and maybe there's a middle ground. But the way he expressed his feelings was dismissive and critical. The right approach would have been to express his disappointment while supporting her, rather than making her feel bad for her natural response to pain.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's comment about other women and the passive-aggressive tone were definitely wrong. He should have been more empathetic and understanding instead of making her feel like she's not trying hard enough. The answer is A.\n"
