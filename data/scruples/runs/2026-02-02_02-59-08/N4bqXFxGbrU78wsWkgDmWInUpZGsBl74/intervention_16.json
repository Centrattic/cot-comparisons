We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting upset with his girlfriend when she cancels plans during her period. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author's girlfriend has a regular issue where she doesn't want to go out when she's on her period, especially the first two days. He mentions he usually puts up with it, which shows he's been understanding. But there was a specific instance where he planned a special date night, she canceled because of her period, and he expressed frustration by comparing her to other women he's lived with who don't act that way. That led to her blowing up at him.\n\nNow, the key points here: the author planned something special, she knew about it in advance, and she still canceled. He was upset because he felt she wasn't making an effort. But his comment about other women probably hurt her feelings. Even if he wasn't angry, the passive-aggressive remark could be seen as dismissive of her pain. \n\nPeriod cramps can be really severe for some women, and it's not just about being lazy or not trying. The author might not realize the physical and emotional toll it can take. By bringing up other women, he might be implying that her experience isn't valid or as bad as others'. That's a sensitive issue and can come across as invalidating her feelings. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend's reaction was extreme, but it's possible she felt attacked. The author's comment could have made her feel judged, especially if she's already in pain. Communication is key here. Instead of comparing, maybe he could have expressed his disappointment without undermining her experience. \n\nSo, while he did plan ahead and tried to be understanding, his choice of words was probably the main issue. It's not right to compare her to others who might handle their periods differently. Every woman's experience is unique. The author's approach might have been disrespectful to her situation, even if his intention wasn't to be harsh. Therefore, he's in the wrong for invalidating her pain and using a comparison that caused hurt.\n"
