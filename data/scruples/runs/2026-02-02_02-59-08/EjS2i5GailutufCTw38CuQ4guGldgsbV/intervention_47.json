It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author is asking if they're in the wrong for not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding. They were told not to hit on anyone, but a bridesmaid invited them to her hotel room. The key points here are the boundaries set by the bride and the actions of the author.\n\nFirst, the bride had explicitly told the author not to hit on any women at the wedding. Even if the author wasn't actively trying to pick people up, they were aware of this rule. Then, when a bridesmaid approached them and invited them to her hotel room, the author accepted. The main question is whether accepting an invitation from someone else violates the initial boundary. The author argues that since the woman approached them, they didn't break the promise. But the bride is upset regardless.\n\nI think the issue is about mutual respect. The bride set a condition, and the author's acceptance of the invitation, regardless of who initiated it, could be seen as disrespecting her wishes. Even if the author didn't go out of their way to flirt, the fact that they engaged in a private interaction with someone else at the wedding might still be problematic, especially in the context of the ex's wedding. The bride's reaction might stem from feeling that the author is still engaging in behavior that could be uncomfortable or inappropriate. So, while the author may not have actively gone against the rule, their acceptance could still be considered crossing the line set by the bride. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong.\n\nBut wait, another angle is whether the author had any intention to break the rule. If the woman approached them, maybe the author didn't see it as hitting on. However, the bride's perspective is important here. If she felt that the author violated her condition, then from her point of view, it's a breach. The problem is about respecting boundaries even if the person isn't the one initiating. So maybe the answer is A, the author is in the wrong because they didn't honor the bride's request, regardless of who initiated the interaction.\n"
