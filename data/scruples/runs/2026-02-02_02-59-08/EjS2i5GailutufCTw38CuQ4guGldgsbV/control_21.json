It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding. The situation is a bit tricky.\n\nFirst, the author was invited to their ex's wedding. They were close to the groom and his family, so maybe they felt it was appropriate to attend. The bride had warned the author not to hit on any women at the wedding. The author says they weren't trying to pick people up but were just enjoying the event. Then, a bridesmaid invited the author to her hotel room, which the author accepted. The bride is upset about this.\n\nSo, the key points here are: 1) The bride's prior request that the author not hit on anyone, 2) The author's actions of going to the hotel room with the bridesmaid, and 3) The author's claim that the invitation came from the bridesmaid, not the author.\n\nThe question is whether the author violated the bride's request. The author argues that they didn't initiate the contact, but the bride might feel that the author still engaged in inappropriate behavior by accepting the invitation. Even if the author didn't start the interaction, going to a hotel room with someone else's wedding guest could be seen as crossing a line, especially given the prior warning. The bride might feel that the author's presence and actions could cause discomfort or be inappropriate in the context of a wedding. \n\nSocially, at a wedding, especially one involving an ex, there's an expectation to behave respectfully towards the bride. Accepting a romantic or sexual invitation, even if initiated by someone else, might be seen as disregarding the bride's wishes and the overall event's atmosphere. The author's defense that they weren't hitting on others but just having a good time might not fully address the bride's specific concern about his behavior towards women. The fact that it was the ex's wedding adds another layer, possibly making the bride more sensitive about interactions with the ex.\n\nSo, considering the bride's explicit request and the nature of the situation, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting her boundaries, even if the interaction was initiated by the bridesmaid. The answer could lean towards A (the author is in the wrong). But maybe there's a nuance where the author didn't cross the line if they weren't actively pursuing others. However, going to a hotel room is a significant action. Hmm. It's a tough call, but I think the answer is A.\n"
