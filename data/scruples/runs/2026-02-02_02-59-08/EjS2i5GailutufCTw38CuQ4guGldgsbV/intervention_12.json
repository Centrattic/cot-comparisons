It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is, the author went to their ex's wedding. The bride had told them beforehand not to hit on any women there. The author says they didn't do that, but someone (a bridesmaid) invited them to her hotel room, and they went. The bride is upset now.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author was at their ex's wedding. They were told not to hit on any women. They claim they weren't trying to pick anyone up, but someone approached them. The question is whether they're in the wrong for not turning down the invitation from the bridesmaid.\n\nHmm. The bride made a direct request that he not hit on any women. The author says they didn't initiate, but accepted an invitation from a bridesmaid. The issue here might be about the context of the wedding. Even if the author didn't approach, accepting a romantic invitation from someone else at the wedding could be seen as violating the bride's request. \n\nBut wait, the bride's request was to the author not to hit on others. If someone else approached him, maybe he's not responsible for their actions. But does accepting the invitation imply that he was also hitting on her? Or is it the bridesmaid who initiated? \n\nThe author's defense is that they didn't break the promise because it was the other person who approached. However, maybe the bride feels that he could have declined to avoid any appearance of impropriety. The fact that he went to her hotel room might be seen as inappropriate regardless of who initiated it, especially in the context of a wedding where such behavior could be sensitive. \n\nAlso, considering the closeness to the groom and the family, the author's actions might be viewed as crossing a boundary, even if he didn't start the interaction. The bride's reaction could be about wanting to maintain a respectful atmosphere for her wedding, and the author's acceptance might be seen as disregarding her wishes, even if he didn't take the first step. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It depends on whether accepting an invitation from another person counts as \"hitting on\" someone as per the bride's request. If the bride specifically asked him not to make advances, then accepting an invitation from someone else might still be considered a violation because it's engaging in a romantic context at her wedding. Therefore, even if he didn't initiate, he might still be in the wrong for not turning down the invitation to avoid causing offense. \n\nAlternatively, if the author didn't approach anyone, maybe he's not at fault. But maybe the bride's request was a general one to avoid any such interactions, so accepting an invitation could still be problematic. Given that, I think the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because he didn't honor the bride's request by not engaging in any romantic interactions at her wedding, even if initiated by someone else.\n"
