It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author attending their ex's wedding, where they were told not to hit on other women. The bride is upset because the author went to a bridesmaid's hotel room, but the author argues that the bridesmaid invited them, so they didn't initiate the contact. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author was invited to the wedding because they're close to the groom and his family. The bride told them not to hit on women, and they thought it was strange but agreed. Then, at the reception, a bridesmaid invited the author to her hotel room. The author went along, and now the bride is upset.\n\nThe key points here are: 1) The author was explicitly told not to hit on women, 2) They didn't actively seek someone out, but someone approached them (the bridesmaid did), and 3) The author went to the hotel room with the bridesmaid. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author's defense is that they didn't initiate the contact. However, even if they didn't start it, accepting the invitation to the hotel room could still be problematic. Weddings are a sensitive time, especially for the bride, and even if the author wasn't hitting on others, going to a hotel room with someone else's bridesmaid might still be seen as inappropriate, regardless of who initiated the contact.\n\nAlso, the fact that the author was at their ex's wedding adds another layer. The bride might feel uncomfortable knowing that someone who was previously in a relationship with her ex is involved with someone close to the wedding. The author's presence and actions could be causing tension, even if they didn't break their promise of not initiating contact.\n\nFrom a social perspective, attending a wedding where you're told not to hit on others and then going to a hotel room with someone else's bridesmaid could be seen as crossing a boundary. The author might not have broken the specific rule (since the invitation wasn't from them), but they still engaged in behavior that the bride found offensive. So, the author could be seen as in the wrong because their actions, regardless of initiation, contributed to the bride's distress.\n"
