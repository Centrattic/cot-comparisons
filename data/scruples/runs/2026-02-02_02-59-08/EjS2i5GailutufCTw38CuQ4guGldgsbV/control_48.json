It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is the asshole (AITA) for not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding. The situation is that the author attended their ex's wedding, and the soon-to-be bride had asked him not to hit on any women there. The author claims he didn't actively try to pick up anyone, just had a good time. Then, a bridesmaid invited him to her hotel room, and he accepted. The bride is upset about this.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The bride made a direct request that he not hit on any women. The author says he didn't break the promise because the woman approached him. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nThe main issue might be about respecting boundaries. Even if the woman invited him, was the author respecting the bride's request by accepting the invitation? The bride's perspective is important here. She might feel that having the author attend the wedding and then engage in such behavior is disrespectful, especially since it's their wedding. The author's argument is that he didn't initiate the approach, but the fact remains that he went along with the invitation. \n\nAlso, considering the context: it's an ex's wedding, and he's close to the groom. But the bride's request was clear. Even if he didn't hit on others, accepting an invitation to a hotel room could be seen as inappropriate, regardless of who initiated it. The author might be in the wrong because he didn't respect the bride's boundaries, even if he didn't break his promise in his own eyes. The bride's feelings are valid, and the author's actions could be perceived as insensitivity towards her request and the situation. \n\nAnother angle is social norms. At a wedding, guests are expected to behave in a way that doesn't cause discomfort to the couple. The author's decision to go to the hotel room might have been a breach of that social expectation. Even if the woman approached him, the author's acceptance could be seen as contributing to the problem. So, from the bride's perspective, he's violating her trust and making her uncomfortable. \n\nBut then again, the author didn't explicitly promise to avoid all interactions with women, just not to hit on them. If the invitation was part of a social dance or mingling, maybe he didn't cross a line. However, the hotel room part is a different level of interaction. It's possible that the author didn't realize how his actions would be perceived, but intentions don't always override the impact. \n\nIn conclusion, whether he's in the wrong depends on whether accepting the invitation (even if initiated by the woman) violates the bride's request. Since the bride is upset and the author's actions could be seen as disregarding her boundaries, the answer might be that he is in the wrong. But maybe not entirely, if the woman approached him. However, the key point is that he was at an ex's wedding, and his presence and actions might be making the bride uncomfortable regardless of the woman's initiation. So probably answer A.\n"
