It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves an ex's wedding where the author was warned not to hit on any women. The author didn't actively try to pick up anyone but ended up going to a hotel room with a bridesmaid. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The bride told the author not to hit on any women at her wedding. The author claims they weren't trying to pick up anyone, just enjoying the party. The bridesmaid invited him to her hotel room, and he accepted. The bride is upset.\n\nThe main question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author argues they didn't break the promise since the invitation was initiated by the bridesmaid. But the bride's perspective is important here. Even if the author didn't approach someone, accepting an invitation from a woman at the wedding could still be seen as hitting on someone, depending on the context and the relationship between the author and the bride.\n\nAlso, the author is close to the groom, so the bride might expect them to be considerate. The act of going to a hotel room with a bridesmaid could be perceived as inappropriate, regardless of who initiated it. The author might not have intended to break the rule, but the outcome could still hurt the bride and the groom, especially if it causes conflict.\n\nAnother angle: the author's actions might be seen as careless, even if not malicious. The bride's request was direct, so the author's failure to avoid any potential for misinterpretation could be a mistake. The fact that the author went to the hotel room might be more of an issue than the initial mingling.\n\nIn relationships, context matters. The author's ex is the groom, so the bride might have feelings of insecurity or expectations of respect. The author's actions could damage trust with the groom and the bride. Even if the author didn't intend to hit on anyone, the perception and the bride's feelings are valid.\n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't consider the potential impact on the bride and the groom, even if their intention wasn't to break the promise. Accepting an invitation to a hotel room could be seen as crossing a line, especially in a sensitive situation like an ex's wedding.\n"
