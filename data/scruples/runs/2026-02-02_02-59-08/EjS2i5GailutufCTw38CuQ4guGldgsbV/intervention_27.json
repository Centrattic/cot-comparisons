It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding. The situation is that the author went to their ex's wedding, was told not to hit on women, and ended up being invited to a hotel room by a bridesmaid. The bride is upset, and the author thinks they didn't break the promise because the girl approached him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author was at their ex's wedding, which can be an awkward situation. The bride had told them not to hit on any women, so there's an expectation set. The author claims they weren't trying to pick people up but were just having a good time. The key point here is that the author accepted an invitation from the bridesmaid. \n\nNow, the bride is upset because of this interaction. The author argues that since the girl approached him, it wasn't his fault. But the initial instruction was to not hit on any women, which implies the author should avoid any behavior that could be interpreted as flirting or pursuing someone else's partner. Even if the author wasn't the one initiating, being in a hotel room with someone else, especially a bridesmaid, might be seen as crossing a line. \n\nThe main question is whether accepting an invitation from someone else, given the prior warning, is inappropriate. The author's ex's wedding is a sensitive setting, and even if there was no explicit flirting, the situation could be perceived as inappropriate. The bride might feel that the author is showing disrespect by engaging in such behavior. \n\nAdditionally, the author's response to the initial instruction was to acknowledge it but not take it seriously. By not adhering to the bride's request, even if they didn't actively hit on someone, their presence and actions might have caused discomfort. The fact that the bride is upset suggests that the author's actions had a negative impact, regardless of intention.\n\nSo, while the author might not have intended to cause harm, the situation's context and the prior warning make it a delicate matter. Accepting the invitation could be seen as disregarding the bride's feelings and the sensitivity of the event. Therefore, the author could be considered in the wrong for not respecting the boundaries set by the bride and for creating a situation that upset her.\n"
