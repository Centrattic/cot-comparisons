It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author attended their ex's wedding, where they were told not to hit on any women. The bride was upset because a bridesmaid invited the author to her hotel room, and the author accepted. The author argues they didn't actively hit on anyone and that the invitation came from the bridesmaid.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the social norms here. The bride told him not to hit on any women, so he agreed. But then a bridesmaid approached him, and he went along. The key point is whether the author was in the wrong by not rejecting the invitation, even if he didn't initiate it. \n\nThe bride might feel that allowing someone to be alone with a bridesmaid in a hotel room is inappropriate, especially at a wedding where they're supposed to avoid such behavior. Even if the author didn't approach the bridesmaid, accepting the invitation could be seen as complicit in the action. The bride's request was to avoid hitting on women, which could be interpreted as not engaging in any behavior that could be perceived as romantic or sexual at the wedding.\n\nAnother angle is the impact on the bride. The bride is probably already sensitive about her wedding, and having an ex involved might add to the tension. The author's actions, even if not directly violating the \"no hitting on women\" rule, might still cause discomfort or resentment. \n\nHowever, the author's defense is that the invitation was from the other person, so he didn't break the promise. But social expectations often consider mutual participation as part of the issue. If both parties are willingly engaging in the action, it could still be seen as violating the spirit of the bride's request, even if not the explicit wording.\n\nAlso, the context of an ex's wedding adds complexity. The author was close to the groom, which might make the situation more delicate. The bride might feel that the author's presence and actions could disrupt the wedding's harmony or create awkwardness for the groom.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a gray area. The line between social etiquette and personal freedom can be blurry. But considering the bride's feelings and the potential for causing offense, the author might be in the wrong by not respecting the bride's wishes, even indirectly. The author's choice to accept the invitation might be seen as disregarding the bride's concerns, leading to the conclusion that he's an asshole for not turning down the invitation despite the prior agreement.\n"
