It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. The situation is about a guy who went to his ex's wedding and ended up going to a hotel room with a bridesmaid. The bride is upset, and he's asking if he's the asshole for not turning down the invitation.\n\nFirst, the bride told him not to hit on any women at the wedding. He says he didn't go out of his way to pick up anyone but was just having a good time. Then, when the bridesmaid invited him to her hotel room, he accepted. \n\nSo the key points here are: Did he violate the bride's request? The bride asked him not to hit on women. The question is whether accepting an invitation from a bridesmaid counts as hitting on her. If the invitation was initiated by the bridesmaid, maybe the guy didn't approach her. But the bride is upset regardless. \n\nAlso, the guy is his ex's wedding. Being at his ex's wedding, even if he's friends with the groom, might be a sensitive situation. Even if he didn't approach someone, going to a hotel room with a bridesmaid could be seen as inappropriate because it's a close event, and people might feel it's taking advantage of the situation.\n\nThe guy argues that he didn't break the promise because the woman approached him. But the bride's perspective is that he should have said no. Maybe the bride felt that as the guest, he should have respected her boundaries by not engaging in any romantic or physical interactions, regardless of who initiated it. \n\nSocial norms often say that in such events, guests should avoid romantic encounters to prevent awkwardness or hurting the host. The guy might not have actively hit on her, but accepting an invitation to a hotel room is definitely a step that could be seen as inappropriate. \n\nSo, even if he didn't initiate the contact, being in a situation that leads to a hotel room with a bridesmaid could still be seen as crossing a line. The bride's anger might stem from the idea that he didn't respect her request to avoid any romantic interactions at her wedding. Therefore, the guy might be in the wrong because he didn't honor the spirit of the bride's request, even if he didn't technically \"hit on\" someone.\n"
