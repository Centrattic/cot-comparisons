It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves an ex's wedding where the writer was told not to hit on any women. The bride is upset because he went to a bridesmaid's hotel room. \n\nFirst, the writer was given a direct instruction by the bride before the wedding not to hit on anyone. Even though he says he wasn't trying to pick up anyone, he ended up going to the hotel with a bridesmaid. The key points here are: the prior agreement, the context of the ex's wedding, and the fact that he followed the invitation rather than initiating.\n\nThe bride is upset, and the writer is questioning if he's an asshole for not rejecting the invitation. The problem might be that even if he didn't initiate, being in a situation where he's alone with someone else at the ex's wedding could be seen as crossing a line. The bride's request was about respecting her wedding event, so the writer's actions might have disregarded that. Even if he didn't break a promise technically (since he didn't ask her out), the act of accepting the invitation could still be problematic. The answer might hinge on whether respecting the bride's wishes is necessary regardless of the technicalities. So, is the writer wrong? If he agreed to not hit on anyone, then being in a hotel room with a bridesmaid might be seen as violating that trust, even if he didn't initiate it. So the answer might be A (yes, he's in the wrong).\n"
