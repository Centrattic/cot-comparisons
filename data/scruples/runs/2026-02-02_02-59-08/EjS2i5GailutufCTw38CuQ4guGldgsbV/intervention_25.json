It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that the author went to their ex's wedding, where the bride had previously told them not to hit on any women. The author didn't actively approach someone but ended up going to a hotel room with a bridesmaid. The bride is upset now.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The bride set a boundary beforehand, and the author agreed to follow it. Even if the author wasn't hitting on people, someone approached them and invited them to the hotel. The author went along with it. The question is whether not rejecting the invitation was wrong.\n\nThe author argues they didn't break the promise because the woman approached them. But the bride is upset, so there's a conflict. The main issue here is about respecting boundaries. Even if the author wasn't the one initiating, by accepting the invitation, they might be violating the spirit of the agreement they made with the bride.\n\nAlso, being at an ex's wedding can be a sensitive situation. The author is close to the groom, but the bride felt the need to set explicit boundaries. The author's decision to go to the hotel room could be seen as disregarding those boundaries, even if they weren't the one who approached the woman. The fact that the bride is upset might indicate that the author's actions crossed a line, even unintentionally.\n\nAnother angle: social etiquette. At a wedding, guests are expected to behave in a way that doesn't discomfort the couple. The author's actions, while perhaps not overtly inappropriate, might still cause the bride embarrassment or distress. The fact that the author is an ex adds another layer of complexity. The bride's request was clear, and the author, by complying with the invitation, might have ignored her concerns.\n\nSo, considering the boundaries set by the bride and the potential for causing her distress, the author might be in the wrong. Answer A (Yes) seems appropriate here.\n"
