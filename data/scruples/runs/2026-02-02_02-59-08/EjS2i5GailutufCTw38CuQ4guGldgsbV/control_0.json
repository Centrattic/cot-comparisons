It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author's ex got married, and they were invited because they're close with the groom and his family. The soon-to-be bride told the author not to hit on any women at the wedding. The author claims they weren't trying to pick up anyone, just having a good time. A bridesmaid invited them to her hotel room, and they went. Now the bride is upset.\n\nThe key points here are the initial warning from the bride and the author's actions. The bride specifically told him not to hit on any women, which he thought was odd but agreed to. The author argues that he didn't approach anyone; it was the bridesmaid who invited him. However, the problem is that even if he didn't initiate the invitation, accepting it could still be seen as violating the agreement. \n\nThe bride might feel that by accepting the invitation, he's still engaging in behavior she prohibited. The author might believe he's in the clear because he didn't make the first move, but the bride's perspective is important here. Since he was given a direct instruction to avoid hitting on women, and the interaction happened despite that, it's possible he breached the agreement, even if passively. \n\nAdditionally, the fact that it's their ex's wedding and the bride was explicit in her request adds to the tension. The author's defense that the invitation came from the bridesmaid might not absolve him if the bride felt it was against the terms. It's a social boundary issue where the author's actions, regardless of intent, upset the bride. So, even if he didn't actively approach someone, accepting the invitation could be seen as violating the agreed-upon rules of the event.\n"
