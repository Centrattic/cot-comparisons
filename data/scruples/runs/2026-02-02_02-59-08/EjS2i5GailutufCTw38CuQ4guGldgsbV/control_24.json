It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding. The scenario involves a recent ex who was invited to the wedding because they're close to the groom and his family. The bride told the person beforehand not to hit on anyone, but the person claims they didn't actively go out of their way to pick up women. Instead, a bridesmaid approached them and invited them to her hotel room, and the person accepted.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The person is an ex, but they're attending a wedding where they have a close relationship with the groom. The bride's direct instruction to not hit on any women is a key point. The person didn't approach anyone but accepted an invitation from a bridesmaid. They argue that since it was the bridesmaid who initiated, they didn't break their promise.\n\nNow, the ethical dilemma here is whether accepting an invitation from someone else at the wedding, even if it wasn't initiated by the person, is inconsiderate or wrong, especially given the bride's prior request. The bride is upset, so there's a social expectation to respect her wishes, even if the person didn't cross a certain line themselves. The person might not have actively pursued others, but by accepting the invitation, they might be seen as violating the spirit of the bride's request.\n\nAlso, the social norms around weddings are important. Weddings are supposed to be about the couple, and guests are expected to behave respectfully. Even if the person is an ex, their actions can affect the bride's comfort. The fact that the person was at an ex's wedding adds another layer; it might be awkward regardless, and the bride's sensitivity is understandable.\n\nOn the other hand, the person claims they were just having a good time, not actively trying to \"pick up\" anyone. The invitation came from the bridesmaid, not them. So, did they cross a line by accepting? It depends on how respectful and considerate they were. If they knew the bride was upset about such things, accepting an invitation to a hotel room might be seen as disregarding her feelings, even if they didn't initiate it.\n\nThe key point is the prior agreement. The bride told them not to hit on any women, and the person agreed. By going to the hotel with a bridesmaid, even if it was her idea, the person might be seen as not respecting that agreement. The bride's anger stems from the fact that such actions could make her uncomfortable, and as a guest, the person might not have considered how their actions affect the couple's event.\n\nSo, while the person didn't actively seek out others, accepting an invitation that could be seen as inappropriate in the context of the wedding and the bride's explicit request might place them in the wrong. The answer might lean towards A, but there's nuance. However, given the bride's direct request and the potential discomfort caused, the person could be considered in the wrong for not respecting the boundaries set, even indirectly.\n"
