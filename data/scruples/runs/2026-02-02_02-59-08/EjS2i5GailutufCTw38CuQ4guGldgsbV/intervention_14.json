It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding. \n\nFirst, the context: the author's ex got married, and they attended the wedding because they're close with the groom. The bride had specifically told the author not to hit on any women at the wedding. The author claims they weren't trying to pick up anyone but ended up going to a hotel room with a bridesmaid who invited them. The bride is upset, and the author is questioning if they're an asshole for not rejecting the invitation.\n\nSo, the key points here are consent and boundaries. The bride had made a direct request that the author not hit on anyone. Even if the author didn't initiate the interaction, the fact that they accepted the invitation could still imply a violation of that request. The author's argument is that the woman approached them, not the other way around. But the original condition set by the bride was a general prohibition on hitting on anyone, not just initiating approaches. \n\nNow, considering social norms and expectations, attending a wedding as a guest (especially one involving an ex) comes with certain unspoken rules. The bride's request is about respect for her event and her feelings. Even if the author didn't break the promise in a technical sense (since the woman approached him), the action likely upset her because it went against the spirit of the request. The author didn't set boundaries for themselves, even though they were aware of the bride's feelings. \n\nAlso, the author's reasoning that they didn't break the promise because the woman approached them might be a bit self-serving. The bride's instruction was to not hit on any women, which could be interpreted as avoiding any romantic or sexual advances, regardless of who initiated it. Accepting an invitation to a hotel room, even if the woman extended it, could still be seen as participating in behavior that goes against the bride's wishes. \n\nIn terms of social etiquette, guests are expected to respect the host's (in this case, the bride's) wishes. By going to the hotel room with someone else, the author might have made the bride feel disrespected or uncomfortable. The fact that they are close to the groom adds another layer, as their actions could reflect poorly on the groom's family or the event's atmosphere.\n\nOn the other hand, if the author is not in a relationship and the bride's request was only about not hitting on others, there's a line between respecting her wishes and personal freedom. However, given the context of the bride's explicit request and the potential for causing her distress, the author's actions could be seen as crossing that line, even if they didn't initiate the interaction.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's intention might not have been to harm, the action still disregarded the bride's explicit request and likely caused her distress. Therefore, they are in the wrong.\n"
