It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author went to their ex's wedding. The bride told them beforehand not to hit on any women, and the author agreed. But then, at the wedding, a bridesmaid invited the author to her hotel room, and they accepted. The bride is now upset. The author is asking if they're an asshole for not turning down the invitation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author was told not to hit on women at the wedding. They thought they were following the rule because the woman approached them, not the other way around. However, the problem here is whether just accepting an invitation counts as \"hitting on\" someone. The bride's instruction was a direct request, so even if the author wasn't actively approaching others, accepting an invitation from someone else could still be considered hitting on them. \n\nThe author might argue that they didn't initiate the interaction, but the bride's rule was probably about not engaging in any such behavior at all. Also, the context is an ex's wedding. The author was close to the groom, so the bride might have felt the need to set boundaries to avoid any awkwardness or for her own comfort. \n\nAnother angle: the author is drinking and mingling, which could lead to more social interactions. The bridesmaid approached them, but accepting a hotel room invitation is a big step. Even if the author didn't start it, they still chose to go along with it. That might be seen as violating the unspoken rules of the event, especially since it's a wedding where such behavior isn't appropriate.\n\nThe bride's reaction is valid because she had communicated her expectation clearly. The author's defense that \"she picked me up\" might not excuse the action in the bride's eyes. The author might have thought they were within the rules, but the outcome is that they caused the bride distress. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author probably is in the wrong because they didn't adhere to the bride's request, regardless of who initiated the interaction. The intention to follow the rules but still ending up in a situation that breached them makes them responsible.\n"
