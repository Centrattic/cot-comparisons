It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the person attended their ex's wedding, which they were close with the groom. The bride had told them beforehand not to hit on any women at the wedding. The author didn't intend to hit on anyone, just having a good time. But then a bridesmaid invited them to her hotel room, and they agreed. Now the bride is upset.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the bride's request and the author's actions. The author didn't outright hit on someone, but someone else approached them. The bride's main issue might be about boundaries and respect. Even if the author didn't initiate, accepting the invitation could still be seen as crossing a line, especially since the bride specifically asked them not to hit on anyone. \n\nBut wait, the author says they didn't break the promise because it was the bridesmaid who approached. Is that a valid point? Maybe, but the bride might feel that the author's presence at the wedding and their social interactions could still be a problem. Also, the fact that they were close to the groom might make the situation more sensitive. The bride could be feeling protective or uncomfortable. \n\nAnother angle: even if the author didn't start it, accepting the invitation might still be considered disrespectful to the bride's wishes. The author was given a direct instruction, so even if it's not a legal contract, socially they might be expected to comply. So perhaps the author is in the wrong because they didn't respect the bride's request, even if indirectly. \n\nBut some might argue that the author wasn't hitting on anyone and was just being social. However, the line between socializing and hitting on someone can be blurry. The bride might feel that any interaction that could lead to romantic attention is a violation. \n\nSo considering all that, the answer might be A (author is in the wrong) because they didn't adhere to the bride's request, leading to her upset. Even if they didn't initiate, accepting the invitation could be seen as not respecting boundaries.\n"
