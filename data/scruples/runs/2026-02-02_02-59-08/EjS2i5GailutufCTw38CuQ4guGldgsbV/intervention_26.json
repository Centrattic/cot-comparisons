It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding.\n\nFirst, let's look at the situation. The author attended their ex's wedding. They were told by the bride before the wedding not to hit on any women there. The author claims they didn't actively go looking for women but were having a good time. Then, a bridesmaid invited them to her hotel room, and they accepted. The bride is upset now.\n\nThe author's defense is that they didn't approach the bridesmaid; the bridesmaid approached them. They also mention they were not trying to hit on anyone but were just mingling. But the key point is that the bride had explicitly told them not to hit on anyone at the wedding. The author didn't follow that request, even if it wasn't a direct approach.\n\nFrom the bride's perspective, she might feel that the author was still engaging in behavior that could be seen as inappropriate, especially given the context of an ex's wedding. Even if the author didn't ask for the invitation, accepting an invitation from the bridesmaid could be seen as crossing a line, especially since the bride had made a specific request to avoid such actions.\n\nThe author's argument is that they didn't break the promise because the woman approached them, but the bride's instruction was to not hit on any women. Accepting an invitation to a hotel room might still be considered hitting on someone, regardless of who initiated it. The line between friendly interaction and romantic pursuit can be blurry, but in a wedding setting, especially an ex's wedding, such actions might be seen as insensitive or inconsiderate.\n\nSo, the author did not honor the bride's request, which was a direct boundary. Even if the author didn't approach the woman, accepting the invitation could still be seen as violating that boundary. The bride's upset is understandable because the wedding is a special event for her, and the author's actions might make her uncomfortable or feel disrespected.\n\nTherefore, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't respect the explicit boundary set by the bride, even if the action wasn't their initial pursuit. The context of an ex's wedding adds sensitivity to the situation, making the author's actions more problematic.\n"
