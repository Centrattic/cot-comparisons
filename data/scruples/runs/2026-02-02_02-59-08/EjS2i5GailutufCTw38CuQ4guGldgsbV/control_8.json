It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the person went to their ex's wedding, right? The bride told them beforehand not to hit on any women there. The person says they didn't go looking for it, but when a bridesmaid invited them to her hotel room, they went. Now the bride is upset.\n\nHmm, the key points here are the promise not to hit on anyone. The person says they didn't break the promise because the woman approached them. But wait, the problem is that the bride made a direct request, and even if the person didn't initiate, they still went along with the invitation. \n\nThe question is whether that's wrong. On one hand, the person didn't actively try to pick up someone, but they accepted an invitation. The bride might feel like their request was about preventing any romantic advances, not just initiating them. So maybe the person should have turned it down to respect the bride's wishes. \n\nAlso, considering it's a wedding, there's a cultural expectation of being respectful. Even if the person was just having fun, the bride's discomfort matters. So maybe the answer is A, the author is in the wrong because they didn't honor the bride's request, even if it was the other person who invited them.\n"
