It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding. The situation is that the bride told the person not to hit on any women at the wedding, but when a bridesmaid invited him to her hotel room, he agreed. The bride is upset, and the person is questioning if they're an asshole for not rejecting the invitation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The person is a friend of the groom's family, attending the wedding. The bride made a direct request not to hit on women there. The person claims they didn't go looking for it; the bridesmaid approached them. But the key issue is whether agreeing to the invite crosses a line, even if the initiative came from the other person.\n\nThe bride's perspective is important here. Even if the person didn't approach the bridesmaid, accepting the invitation could be seen as violating the bride's request. The bride might feel it's inappropriate for any guest, especially someone with a past relationship, to engage in such behavior. The person argues that they didn't break their promise, but the bride's request was likely to prevent any advances, not just ones they initiated.\n\nAlso, attending a wedding with an ex's new partner can be a sensitive situation. Even if the person is close to the groom, their actions could make the bride uncomfortable. The decision to accept the hotel room invite might be seen as inconsiderate, regardless of who made the initial move. \n\nFrom a social standpoint, weddings are about celebrating the couple, and guests are expected to be respectful. If the person knew the bride's feelings beforehand, agreeing to the invite could be seen as disregarding her boundaries. Even if it wasn't a direct hit-on, the context of a wedding and the bride's explicit request makes the situation tricky. \n\nSo, while the person might not have actively pursued the encounter, their acceptance could still be viewed as inconsiderate and a breach of the agreement they made with the bride. Therefore, the person might be in the wrong for not respecting the bride's wishes, even if the interaction wasn't initiated by them.\n"
