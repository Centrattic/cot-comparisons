It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding. Let's look at the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the author went to their ex's wedding, which is already a potentially awkward situation. The soon-to-be bride told them not to hit on any women there. The author agreed to that, thinking it was a direct demand. But later, when a bridesmaid invited them to her hotel room and they accepted, the bride is upset. \n\nHmm, the author argues that they didn't initiate the approach; the bridesmaid did. They also mention they weren't trying to pick up anyone but were just having a good time. But there are a few key points here. \n\n1. They were at their ex's wedding. Even if they're not in a relationship anymore, attending such an event can be sensitive. The bride might have felt it was inappropriate for the author to be there, especially if there was unresolved tension or if they were close to the groom. \n\n2. The bride had explicitly asked them not to hit on others. By accepting the invitation, even if it was initiated by the bridesmaid, the author might have violated that agreement indirectly. The bride's request was to prevent them from approaching others, not necessarily the other way around. But if the author goes to the hotel room with someone else, even if invited, it could still be seen as the author engaging in the behavior the bride wanted to avoid.\n\n3. The author's reasoning is that they didn't break the promise. But the promise was to not approach others, not to be approached. The line here is blurry. If the author is okay with being approached, does that still count as violating the spirit of the agreement? The bride might feel that the author was still participating in the behavior by accepting the invitation, even if not initiating it.\n\nAlso, the author's presence and actions could be seen as causing discomfort to the bride. Weddings are about the couple, and someone from the ex's past might make the bride uneasy. The author might not see the issue, but the bride's reaction is valid if she feels disrespected or if the situation could have been avoided.\n\nAnother angle: the author was close to the groom. Maybe the groom was okay with it, but the bride isn't. The author might not have considered the bride's feelings as much as the groom's. They prioritized their own enjoyment over the bride's request, which could be seen as inconsiderate.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author didn't directly approach someone, their actions still went against the bride's wishes, even if indirectly. The context of being at an ex's wedding adds another layer of sensitivity. The author might be in the wrong because they didn't fully respect the boundaries set by the bride, even if their own actions weren't a direct violation of the initial promise.\n"
