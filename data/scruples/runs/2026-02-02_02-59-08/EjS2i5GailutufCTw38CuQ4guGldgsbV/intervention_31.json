It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding. The situation is that the author was told not to hit on any women at the bride's wedding by the bride herself. The author went to the wedding, had a good time, and eventually ended up in a hotel room with a bridesmaid. The bride is upset, and the author is defending their actions by saying the girl approached him, not the other way around.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author's ex is now married, and they were invited because they're close to the groom and family. The bride specifically warned them not to hit on anyone. The key point here is whether the author respected the bride's boundaries. Even though the author claims they weren't trying to pick up anyone, the fact that they accepted an invitation from a bridesmaid to her hotel room might be seen as crossing a line. The bride's request was a clear boundary, and the author's actions could be perceived as disregarding that boundary, even if they didn't initiate the approach. \n\nSocial norms suggest that at a wedding, especially one where the author is an ex of the bride, maintaining a respectful distance is important. The author's presence might make the bride uncomfortable, and engaging in such behavior could be seen as insensitive. The defense that the girl approached him doesn't absolve him from the responsibility of respecting the bride's request. So, the author might be in the wrong for not considering the bride's feelings and the potential implications of their actions, even if they weren't the first to approach. \n\nHowever, if the author truly wasn't trying to hit on anyone and the situation was consensual between them and the bridesmaid, some might argue that it's not their fault. But given the bride's explicit request, the author should have been more cautious. The main issue here is whether the author upheld the trust and respect expected in such a sensitive situation. \n\nConsidering all this, the answer would likely be A (the author is in the wrong) because they didn't respect the bride's boundaries, even if they didn't initiate the interaction.\n"
