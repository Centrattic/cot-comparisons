It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding. The situation is a bit complex, so I need to consider different angles.\n\nFirst, the author went to their ex's wedding. They were close with the groom but the bride had directly told them not to hit on any women. The author claims they weren't actively trying to pick people up but ended up being invited to a hotel room by a bridesmaid. The bride is upset, and the author is defending themselves by saying the woman approached him, not the other way around.\n\nHmm. The key points here are consent and the bride's request. The bride made a clear boundary before the event, which the author acknowledged. Even if the author didn't initiate the interaction, accepting the invitation could still be seen as violating that boundary. The fact that the author was at an ex's wedding adds another layer. People might feel that showing up there is already a sensitive situation, and not respecting the bride's request could be seen as crossing a line.\n\nAlso, the author mentions they were drinking and mingling. While alcohol isn't an excuse, it might explain their behavior, but that doesn't absolve them of responsibility. The main issue is about respecting someone else's rules when they've been set. The author's argument that the woman approached him doesn't negate the fact that he agreed to go to her hotel room. Even if not initiating, agreeing to such a private meeting might be seen as crossing the line set by the bride.\n\nOn the other hand, if the author truly wasn't trying to flirt and just happened to be approached, maybe they're not at fault. But the key is that the bride had a legitimate request to avoid any such interactions. The author's decision to accept the invitation, despite the prior agreement, could be seen as disregarding the bride's feelings and the sensitivity of the situation. \n\nSo, considering the context of the ex's wedding and the direct request from the bride, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting that boundary. Even if the invitation was from another person, the setting and the prior agreement matter here. The answer would likely be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they didn't uphold the promise they made to the bride, which could be seen as causing unnecessary hurt or disrespect in a sensitive situation.\n"
