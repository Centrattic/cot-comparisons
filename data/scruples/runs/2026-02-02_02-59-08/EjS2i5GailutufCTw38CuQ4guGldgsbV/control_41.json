It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person described in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a wedding of their ex, where the bride told them not to hit on any women. The person went to the wedding, had a good time, and ended up going to a hotel room with a bridesmaid. Now the bride is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the key points. The bride made a direct request not to hit on women. The person claims they didn't make a promise, just that the bride told them. The user (the author) says he didn't initiate; the bridesmaid invited him. But the bride is mad. \n\nSo, was the author in the wrong? Well, even if the bride didn't get a direct promise, the request was made. The author chose to attend the wedding, which the bride had asked them not to hit on women. By going to the hotel room with the bridesmaid, even if it was her initiative, it could be seen as the author not respecting the bride's wishes. \n\nBut does that make them an asshole? Maybe. They were at a wedding where the bride specifically told them not to hit on women. Even if they didn't promise, they were aware. The bride might feel disrespected. Also, attending the wedding of an ex's spouse, which could be awkward, and then engaging in such behavior might be considered inconsiderate. \n\nHowever, the author claims they weren't trying to hit on anyone and were just having fun. The key here is whether the author's actions breached the social expectation set by the bride. If the author knew not to hit on women, but still ended up in a hotel room with one, even if it was her idea, it's possible the author is at fault for not being more cautious. \n\nOn the other hand, the bride's anger might be overreacting, but the question is whether the author did something wrong. They didn't explicitly promise, but they were told. The action of going to the hotel room could be seen as violating the bride's wishes, even if not through direct initiation. \n\nSo the answer might be A (Yes, in the wrong) because they were aware of the request and still engaged in behavior that the bride considered inappropriate. Even if they didn't start it, they participated, which could be seen as a breach of trust or respect.\n"
