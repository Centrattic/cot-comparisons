It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not turning down a girl at a wedding. The situation involves an ex's wedding where the author was invited. The bride had told him beforehand not to hit on any women, which he agreed to. However, during the reception, a bridesmaid invited him to her hotel room, and he went along. Now the bride is upset because of this.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author went to a wedding where he was told not to hit on anyone. He claims he wasn't trying to pick up others but was just having a good time. The issue arises when the bridesmaid approached him. He accepted her invitation, leading to the bride's anger.\n\nThe user wants to know if the author is at fault. The options are A (yes) or B (no). To determine this, I should think about social norms and the expectations in such situations. Weddings are significant events, and the bride's request to avoid hitting on others is a common courtesy to prevent awkwardness or hurt feelings. The author was explicitly told not to do this, so he should have respected that.\n\nHowever, the author argues that the woman approached him, not the other way around. This complicates things because he didn't initiate the interaction. But the line between socializing and flirting can be blurry. Even if he wasn't actively seeking to hit on someone, accepting an invitation to a hotel room immediately after the reception might cross boundaries, especially in a context where the bride had set clear expectations.\n\nAnother angle is that the author is ex with the groom, which might add sensitivity. The bride might feel that any romantic interaction could be seen as inappropriate, even if the author had no intent. The fact that he went to the hotel room with another woman, despite the bride's prior warning, could be seen as disregarding her feelings and the event's social dynamics. Even if he didn't break the promise by initiating it, the outcome still upset the bride, which matters.\n\nIn social norms, respecting others' boundaries is crucial. The bride's discomfort is valid, and the author's actions, even if not his intent, caused her distress. The key here is whether his actions were inconsiderate of her wishes, regardless of his personal intentions. Since he was given a direct instruction and then proceeded in a way that led to the bride feeling upset, he might be seen as in the wrong for not being more cautious and respecting her boundaries, even if the woman approached him.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the answer might lean towards A (yes), as he should have anticipated the bride's feelings and avoided the situation to maintain harmony, even if he didn't actively seek it out.\n"
