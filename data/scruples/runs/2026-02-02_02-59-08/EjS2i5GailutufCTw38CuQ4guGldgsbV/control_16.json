It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding. The situation is that the bride told the author not to hit on any women at the wedding. The author went to the wedding, had a good time, and ended up going to a bridesmaid's hotel room. The bride is now upset.\n\nFirst, the key points here are the bride's direct request and the author's actions. The author claims he didn't actively hit on anyone but was approached by the bridesmaid. The bride's anger is the main issue here. \n\nThe user's question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI need to consider social norms and the expectations in such situations. If the bride specifically asked the author not to hit on anyone, even if he's an ex, then he might be at fault for not respecting her request. Even if he didn't initiate, accepting the invitation could be seen as disregarding her wishes. \n\nHowever, the author argues that the girl approached him and that he didn't break the promise. But the bride might feel that by accepting the invitation, he's still engaging in the behavior she wanted to avoid. \n\nAlso, the context is a wedding where the author is close to the groom and family. The bride might be sensitive about any interactions that could be perceived as flirtatious or inappropriate, even if it's with someone else. \n\nIn terms of social etiquette, guests are expected to respect the host's wishes, especially in such a personal event. If the bride made a direct request, the author's failure to comply could be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nOn the other hand, if the invitation from the bridesmaid was a personal choice and not part of the author's actions, maybe he isn't entirely at fault. But since the bride is upset, and the situation could be seen as crossing a line, the author might be in the wrong. \n\nSo, considering the social expectations and the bride's perspective, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
