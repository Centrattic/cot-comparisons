It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding. The scenario is that the author's ex got married, and the author attended as a close friend of the groom. The bride had previously told the author not to hit on any women at the wedding. The author claims they weren't trying to pick anyone up, just having a good time. Then, a bridesmaid invited the author to her hotel room, which the author accepted. Now the bride is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the expectations and norms around weddings. Weddings are significant events, and guests are usually expected to behave respectfully, especially if they're in a position that might cause discomfort. The author's ex is now married, so the author is an ex-partner, which adds a layer of sensitivity. \n\nThe bride had specifically told the author not to hit on others, so there's a direct request that the author was aware of. Even if the author claims they weren't trying to pick someone up, the fact that they accepted the invitation from the bridesmaid could be seen as violating that request. The key point here is whether the author's actions, regardless of intent, breached the bride's boundaries.\n\nThe author argues that the bridesmaid approached them, so it wasn't their initiative. However, the bride's perspective is that the author participated in the interaction, which could be perceived as a breach. Even if the author didn't start it, accepting the invitation might still be considered crossing a line, especially in the context of a wedding where such behavior could be frowned upon.\n\nAlso, the author's presence at the wedding as a close friend of the groom might mean their actions have a bigger impact. The bride could feel that the author's behavior reflects poorly on her event or causes awkwardness for the groom and family. The author might not realize how their actions, even if innocent, could be misinterpreted or cause distress.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might not have intended to hurt anyone, and the bride's reaction seems overly sensitive. But considering the direct request made by the bride, the author's decision to accept the invitation despite that could be seen as disregarding her wishes. Respect for others' boundaries is important, so even if the author didn't have malicious intent, not honoring the bride's request could be considered inconsiderate.\n\nSo, balancing both sides, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't respect the bride's explicit request, even if they didn't initiate the interaction. The answer would be A.\n"
