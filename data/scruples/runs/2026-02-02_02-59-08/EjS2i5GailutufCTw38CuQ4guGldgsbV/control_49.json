It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves their ex getting married, and the person attending the wedding. The bride told them not to hit on any women, and they ended up going to a hotel room with a bridesmaid. The author is now being accused by the bride.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author was told by the bride not to hit on anyone, but they didn't go out of their way to approach someone. The bridesmaid approached them. The author is arguing that they didn't break the promise because it was the other person who initiated. \n\nHmm. The bride's request was a direct instruction, even if it seems odd. The author might have felt it was unfair, but they agreed to it. By going to the hotel room with the bridesmaid, they might be seen as violating that agreement. Even if the other person initiaited, being in a private setting with someone else's friend could be problematic, especially at a wedding where such behavior is sensitive. \n\nAlso, considering the context of an ex's wedding, the author's presence might be delicate. The bride might feel that any interaction that could be seen as romantic or inappropriate is a breach of trust, even if the author is single. The fact that the author went along with the invitation could be seen as disrespectful to the bride's wishes and the groom's family. \n\nBut the author didn't actively hit on anyone; they were just having fun. The key issue here is whether following someone to a hotel room breaches the agreement. If the bride specifically asked them not to hit on anyone, then any situation that could be interpreted as romantic might be an issue. The author might argue that they weren't the one approaching, but the action still occurred. \n\nIt's a bit of a gray area. On one hand, the bride's request was clear, and the author did go into a private setting with another attendee. On the other hand, the other person initiated the invitation. But in social contexts, especially after a direct request, actions that could lead to misinterpretation are often frowned upon. \n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't adhere to the bride's specific request, even if the other person initiated. The fact that they went along could be seen as a breach of trust, even if it wasn't their initial intention to hit on someone. Therefore, the answer might be A, yes, the author is in the wrong.\n"
