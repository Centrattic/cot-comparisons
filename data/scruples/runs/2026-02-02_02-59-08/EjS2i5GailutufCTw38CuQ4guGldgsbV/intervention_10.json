It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about attending an ex's wedding, being told not to hit on women, and then someone inviting him to her hotel room.\n\nFirst, the author was explicitly told by the bride that he shouldn't hit on any women at the wedding. He agreed to that. Then, during the reception, a bridesmaid (not the bride) invited him to her hotel room. He went along with it. The bride is upset now, and he's questioning if he's an asshole for not turning down the invitation.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the initial agreement not to hit on any women and the fact that it's the ex's wedding. Even though the bridesmaid approached him, the author had made a promise to the bride. By accepting the invitation, he's violating that promise, even if he didn't initiate the contact. The bride's anger stems from the fact that he didn't follow through on his word, regardless of who approached whom. \n\nAlso, the context of the ex's wedding adds another layer. The bride might be particularly sensitive about her own wedding, and having someone from her ex's life engaging in behavior that could be seen as inappropriate, even if not with her specifically, might make her uncomfortable. The author's argument that he didn't initiate the contact is valid, but the promise he made to the bride was to not hit on anyone, not just her. So by going to the hotel room with the bridesmaid, he's still violating that agreement.\n\nTherefore, even though the invitation came from the bridesmaid, the author's action of accepting it goes against what he had promised. So, he's in the wrong for not honoring his commitment to the bride.\n"
