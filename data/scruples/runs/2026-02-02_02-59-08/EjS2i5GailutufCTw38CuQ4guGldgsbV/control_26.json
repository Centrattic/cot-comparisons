It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding.\n\nFirst, the key points from the story: The person went to their ex's wedding where they're close with the groom. The bride had told them beforehand not to hit on any women, which they found weird but agreed to. Then, at the wedding, a bridesmaid invited them to her hotel room, and they accepted. Now the bride is angry. The author is defending themselves by saying they didn't initiate the approach and didn't break their promise.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Let me think about social norms and expectations here. The bride made a direct request, which the author agreed to. Even if the author didn't plan to hit on anyone, accepting an invitation from a bridesmaid might still be seen as violating that agreement. The bride's anger could stem from the perception that the author is still engaging in behavior she asked him to avoid. The author argues that the bridesmaid approached him, but the original agreement was about not hitting on women, which could be interpreted as not seeking out attention. If the author went to the hotel room, maybe that's seen as taking the initiative despite the request.\n\nAlso, the social context of a wedding is important. Weddings are sensitive events, especially ex-relations. The bride might feel that the author's presence and actions could cause discomfort or rumors. Even if the author didn't mean to cause harm, the action might still be seen as insensitive.\n\nAnother angle: The author was at the wedding, which is a special event for the couple. The bride's request was to avoid hitting on others, which is a reasonable boundary, especially in a close-knit family setting. The author's acceptance of the invitation could be seen as disregarding her request, even if they didn't initiate the approach. The fact that the invitation came from the bridesmaid doesn't absolve the author if they knew the bride's expectations and still went along.\n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't explicitly break the promise if they didn't approach someone. The bride's request was to not hit on women, and if another woman approached them, maybe the author isn't at fault. But the line here is blurry. The author might have overstepped by accepting the invitation, regardless of who initiated it. The bride's anger might be about the perception rather than the action itself.\n\nSo, considering these points, the answer could be either way. But given that the bride specifically asked him not to hit on women, and he still went to the hotel room, even if invited, it might be seen as violating her request. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't honor the bride's boundaries, leading to her being upset. Answer A.\n"
