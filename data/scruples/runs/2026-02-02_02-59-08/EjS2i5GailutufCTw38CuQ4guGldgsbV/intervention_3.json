It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about attending an ex's wedding, where the bride told him not to hit on any women. He went, had a good time, and ended up going to a hotel room with a bridesmaid. The bride is upset, and he's wondering if he made a mistake.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author was told not to hit on any women at the wedding. He claims he wasn't trying to pick anyone up but was just having fun. The bridesmaid invited him to her hotel room, and he accepted. The bride is angry, and he's confused because he thinks he didn't break the promise since she approached him.\n\nNow, considering social norms and what's expected at a wedding. Weddings are about celebrating the couple, and guests are expected to behave respectfully. Even though the author was at his ex's wedding, he was still a guest, and the bride's request was a direct communication. Accepting an invitation to a hotel room with someone else, even if initiated by the other person, might be seen as inappropriate in that context. The bride's perspective is important here because she's the one who set the boundary.\n\nThe author argues that he didn't approach the bridesmaid, but the fact that he accepted her invitation could be problematic. It's possible he didn't intend to disrespect the bride, but by going to the hotel room, he might have crossed a line. Weddings can be sensitive, especially when exes are involved. The key issue is whether he respected the bride's boundaries. Even if he didn't actively hit on others, accepting a romantic invitation from another attendee could be seen as violating the unspoken rules of being a guest at someone else's special event.\n\nAlso, the author was close to the groom, so he might have been expected to be more considerate. The bride's upset reaction suggests that she felt her wedding was invaded in some way. Even if the author didn't break a direct promise (since he didn't approach anyone), his actions might still be seen as inconsiderate. The question is whether his behavior was respectful towards the bride's feelings and the context of the wedding.\n\nIn terms of judgment, society often looks at intentions but also at the impact of actions. Even if the author didn't have bad intentions, the outcome (the bride being upset) could make him responsible. The answer might hinge on whether accepting the invitation was a reasonable thing to do in that situation. Since it's a wedding, people are often more dressed up, drinking, and in a social setting, so personal boundaries might be more sensitive. The author's decision to go to the hotel room, regardless of who initiated, could be seen as the wrong choice because it's inappropriate in the context of the event and might have caused unnecessary tension between the couple.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is in the wrong because he didn't respect the bride's boundaries and acted in a way that was inappropriate for a wedding setting, even if it wasn't his intention to hit on someone.\n"
