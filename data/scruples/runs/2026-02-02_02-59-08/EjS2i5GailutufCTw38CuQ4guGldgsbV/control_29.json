It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is at their ex's wedding. The bride had asked them not to hit on any women, which they thought was odd but agreed to. During the reception, a bridesmaid invited them to her hotel room, and they accepted. Now the bride is upset.\n\nFirst, the key points are the initial promise and the specific actions. The author says they didn't go looking for someone to hit on; the bridesmaid approached them. But the bride's instruction was that the author shouldn't hit on women. If the author accepted an invitation from someone else, does that count as breaking the promise? It might depend on context. If the author was merely accepting an invitation without initiating, maybe they didn't violate the agreement. But the bride could still be upset because someone else's actions led to a situation that she found inappropriate.\n\nAnother angle is the social etiquette. Even if the author didn't initiate, being at an ex's wedding and then going to a hotel room with a bridesmaid might be seen as crossing a line, especially since the bride had asked them not to. The author's defense is that the invitation came from the other person, but the responsibility might still lie with them for accepting, especially given their prior agreement.\n\nAlso, the author's relationship with the groom and family is close, which might influence perceptions. But the bride's feelings are valid here. Even if the author didn't break the promise technically, the situation might have been inconsiderate. The bride's request was to prevent any romantic advances, and the hotel room incident could be seen as a breach of that unspoken boundary, regardless of who initiated it.\n\nSo, considering the promise made to the bride and the potential harm caused, the author might be in the wrong. They could have avoided the situation by declining the invitation to respect the bride's wishes, even if the invitation wasn't from them. The answer might be A (Yes), but there's nuance here. Alternatively, if the author didn't directly break the promise and the bride is overreacting, then B (No). It's a bit of a judgment call based on intent and consequences.\n"
