It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves an ex's wedding where the author was told not to hit on any women. The bride got upset because the author ended up going to a bridesmaid's hotel room.\n\nFirst, the author was explicitly told not to hit on women. They mention they weren't out to pick people up, but a bridesmaid invited them. The key point here is whether the author initiated the interaction. The user says they didn't approach anyone but accepted the invitation. The bride is upset, possibly because it's her wedding and she might feel it's inappropriate regardless of who initiated. \n\nBut the author didn't break their promise since they didn't approach anyone. However, they might not have considered the bride's feelings even if they were invited. Maybe the bride thought the author shouldn't be in that situation at all, regardless of who started it. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, even if they didn't initiate, being in a hotel room with someone else's bridesmaid at their wedding could be seen as crossing a line, especially after a direct request. The author might not be the asshole for not rejecting the invitation, but maybe they should have considered the bride's feelings more. Hmm, but the question is if they are in the wrong. Since the invite was from the bridesmaid, not the author's action, perhaps the answer is B, no. But some might argue that they should have turned it down to avoid making the bride uncomfortable. It's a bit of a gray area. \n\nI think the main point is that the author didn't violate the explicit instruction (didn't approach anyone), but the situation still upset the bride. However, since the author didn't make the first move, maybe they aren't in the wrong. So the answer would be B.\n"
