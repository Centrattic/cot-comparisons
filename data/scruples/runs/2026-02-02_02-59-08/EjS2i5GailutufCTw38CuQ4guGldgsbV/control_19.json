It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding. The situation is that the author was told by the bride not to hit on anyone, but then a bridesmaid invited him to her hotel room, and he accepted. The bride is upset now.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the social norms here. The author's ex got married, so it's an ex's wedding. The author is close to the groom and family, so maybe they were invited. The bride told the author not to hit on anyone, which is a direct request. The author claims they weren't trying to pick people up, just having fun. Then, a bridesmaid invited him to her hotel room, and he went. The key points here are consent and the initial request by the bride.\n\nThe author argues they didn't break the promise because the girl approached him. But the bride's request was to not hit on anyone, which could include being approached. If the author was in a situation where someone approached him, does that still count as violating the bride's request? It depends on interpretation. The bride might see any flirting or going to a hotel room as inappropriate, regardless of who initiated it.\n\nAlso, the context is an ex's wedding. There might be lingering sensitivities. Even if the author isn't in a relationship now, being at the wedding of an ex could raise eyebrows. The author's actions might be seen as disrespectful to the bride, even if they weren't in a relationship anymore.\n\nSocial expectations often dictate that at a wedding, even if you're not in a relationship, you should avoid any behavior that could be seen as inappropriate or that might make the couple uncomfortable. The bride's request was explicit, so ignoring it could be seen as dismissive of her feelings. The fact that the author went to the hotel room with a bridesmaid, even if she invited him, could be viewed as crossing a line, especially in the context of the wedding and the bride's explicit request.\n\nThe author might not have intended to break the promise, but the situation's outcome is that the bride is upset. The author's responsibility here includes respecting the bride's wishes even if they feel the situation was consensual. The key issue is whether the author respected the boundaries set by the bride. If the bride felt it was inappropriate, then the author's actions, even if not directly hitting on someone, could be seen as violating the spirit of her request.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong for not heeding the bride's request, regardless of who initiated the interaction. The answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
