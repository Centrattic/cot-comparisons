It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding. The situation is that the author went to their ex's wedding, where they were close with the groom and his family. The bride told the author beforehand not to hit on any women. At the wedding, a bridesmaid invited the author to her hotel room, and he went. The bride is upset now, and the author is confused because they didn't hit on anyone, just someone else approached them.\n\nFirst, the key points here are the prior agreement and the actions taken. The bride asked the author not to hit on any women, which he thought was weird but agreed. Then, a bridesmaid invited him. The author didn't initiate the contact; the bridesmaid did. So technically, he didn't break the agreement because he didn't approach anyone. But the bride is upset anyway. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Even though the author didn't initiate, the context is a wedding, which is a sensitive time. The author was already in a position where the bride had specific requests. The fact that someone else approached him might not absolve him of responsibility because he could have considered the bride's feelings. Even if he didn't break the promise, his actions still caused her distress. Maybe there's an expectation that, in a wedding setting, certain boundaries should be maintained beyond just following someone else's advances. \n\nAlso, the author was at their ex's wedding, which adds another layer. Even though they're close to the groom, the presence there might require more sensitivity. The bride could have felt that the author's acceptance of the invitation, regardless of who initiated it, breached the unspoken respect for the wedding's sanctity.\n\nSo, even if he didn't technically violate the agreement, the author might be in the wrong for not considering the bride's feelings and the context of the event. The answer could be A (Yes) because he should have respected the bride's request more fully, avoiding any situation that could cause her discomfort, regardless of who initiated the interaction.\n"
