It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding. The situation is a bit complex.\n\nFirst, the ex got married, and the author attended as a friend of the groom. The bride had asked the author not to hit on any women at her wedding. The author claims they weren't trying to pick people up but ended up going to a hotel with a bridesmaid. The bride is upset, and the author is confused because they didn't actively approach the woman; she invited them.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the bride's request, the author's actions, and the social norms. The bride made a direct request not to hit on others, which the author acknowledged. Even if the author didn't approach, accepting an invitation from someone else could still be problematic. The bride might feel this is crossing a line, especially at her wedding, which is a sensitive time. Socially, it's often expected to avoid such situations to respect the couple's event. The author might be in the wrong because they didn't honor the spirit of the request by avoiding any potential awkwardness or hurt feelings. The answer might lean towards A, but I need to make sure there's no nuance I'm missing. The author didn't break the letter of the promise, but maybe the intent. Social etiquette often prioritizes respecting boundaries even if not explicitly broken. So, the answer is likely A.\n"
