It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author attending their ex's wedding, which they were invited to because they're close with the groom and his family. The bride had told the author beforehand not to hit on any women at her wedding. The author claims they didn't go looking for attention but ended up being invited to a hotel room by a bridesmaid. The bride is upset now, and the author is questioning if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The bride made a direct request that the author not hit on any women. The author says they didn't break this promise because the bridesmaid initiated the invitation. However, accepting such an invitation could be seen as violating the spirit of the request, even if the author didn't actively seek it out. The bride might feel that even if the author didn't approach someone, accepting the invitation still undermines the wedding's atmosphere and her own comfort.\n\nAlso, considering social norms, attending an ex's wedding can be sensitive. Even if the author is close to the groom, the presence of the bride and her expectations should be respected. The author's actions, even if passive, might still be perceived as disrespectful to the bride's wishes. The fact that the author is now in a situation where someone approaches them for a romantic encounter at the wedding could be seen as crossing a line, regardless of who initiated it.\n\nAnother angle is consent and respect. The bride's request was made for a reason. Even if the author didn't actively pursue it, accepting the invitation might not have considered her feelings. The author might be in the wrong because they didn't take the bride's boundaries seriously, even if they think they followed the rules. The social context of a wedding is supposed to be a joyous occasion without such complications, so the author's actions, while perhaps not overtly aggressive, still caused distress.\n\nBut maybe the author isn't entirely in the wrong. The bride's request was direct, but if the author didn't seek out attention, it's possible they didn't intend to disrespect the bride. However, the outcome is that the bride is upset, which is the main point here. The question is whether the author's actions, even if passive, were inappropriate given the context.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author might not have actively sought to hit on someone, accepting an invitation to a hotel room at an ex's wedding could be seen as violating the bride's trust and expectations. Socially, even if the author didn't initiate, the action still caused distress, making the author at least partially responsible. Therefore, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
