It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person went to their ex's wedding, which they were invited to. The bride told them beforehand not to hit on other women there. The author says they didn't actively try to pick up anyone, but they ended up going to a hotel room with a bridesmaid who invited them.\n\nFirst, the main issue is whether the author is in the wrong for accepting the invitation. The bride's main objection is that the author was at their ex's wedding and this might be awkward or hurtful. The author argues that they didn't initiate the invitation, so they didn't break the promise made to the bride when she asked them not to hit on women.\n\nBut even if the author didn't start it, accepting the invitation could be seen as disregarding the bride's boundaries. The bride probably wanted the author to avoid any situations that could be seen as inappropriate, especially at her wedding. The fact that the author went to the hotel room with someone might still be offensive, regardless of who initiated it. \n\nAlso, considering they're close to the groom, maybe the author should have been more cautious to prevent any tension or hurt feelings. The situation could have been avoided if the author had politely declined the invitation. So, even if they didn't break the promise literally, they might have violated the spirit of the request, leading to the bride being upset. \n\nTherefore, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't respect the bride's boundaries by engaging in a potentially compromising situation, even if the other person initiated it. The key is about respecting the bride's wishes and avoiding any appearance of impropriety at her wedding.\n"
