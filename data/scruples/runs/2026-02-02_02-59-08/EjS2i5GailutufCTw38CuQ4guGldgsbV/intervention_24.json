It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding. The situation is that the author was told not to hit on any women at the wedding. The author claims they weren't actively hitting on anyone but ended up going to a hotel room with a bridesmaid. The bride is upset, and the author argues that the girl approached him, so he didn't initiate it.\n\nFirst, the key points here are the promise made to the bride and the actions taken. The author agreed not to hit on any women, which was a direct request. Even if the author didn't explicitly ask for the hotel room, accepting the invitation could still be seen as violating that promise. The bride might feel that the author is still engaging in behavior she prohibited, regardless of who initiated the contact. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that he didn't break the promise because the girl approached him. However, the promise was to not hit on any women. Whether the author initiated the approach or not, accepting the invitation could be seen as participating in the behavior the bride wanted to prevent. The bride's main concern is probably about her wedding atmosphere and not wanting exes to engage in romantic activities, even if it's not the author's fault. \n\nAlso, the author was at a wedding of their ex, which is a sensitive situation. Even if the author was close with the groom, the bride's feelings matter here. The act of going to a hotel room with a bridesmaid might be perceived as inappropriate regardless of who extended the invitation. \n\nSo, even if the author didn't initiate the contact, by accepting the invitation, they still partook in an activity the bride had explicitly asked them not to do. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't honor the bride's request, leading to her being upset. The answer would depend on whether accepting the invitation is considered part of hitting on someone. If hitting on includes engaging in flirtatious or romantic activities, then accepting the hotel room invite would be in violation. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they didn't respect the bride's boundaries despite her direct request.\n"
