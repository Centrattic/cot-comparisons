It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves them attending their ex's wedding, not turning down a girl who invited them to her hotel room, and the bride being upset.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author's ex got married, and they were close to the groom and family. The bride had told the author before the wedding not to hit on any women there. The author says they didn't actively try to flirt but were just having fun. Then a bridesmaid invited them to her hotel room, and they went. Now the bride is angry. The author is confused because they feel they didn't break any promise since the invitation was from the girl, not them.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author made a mistake. The bride's demand was that the author not hit on anyone. The author claims they didn't, but the problem is that someone invited them. However, the author's presence at the ex's wedding might already be a sensitive situation. Even if the invitation came from the bridesmaid, accepting it could be seen as taking advantage of the situation, especially since the author was at an ex's wedding, which might be an awkward place for such interactions.\n\nThe author might argue they didn't initiate, but the issue is that being in that environment and accepting such an invitation could still be problematic. The bride's perspective is that she made a direct request to not hit on anyone, and even if the author didn't start it, accepting the invitation might still violate that request. The author's reasoning that they didn't break the promise because it was the girl's initiative might not hold because the bride's rule was about not hitting on others, regardless of who initiated.\n\nAlso, the social context of being at an ex's wedding adds another layer. It's generally considered poor form to pursue romantic or sexual encounters at someone else's wedding, especially if you're an ex. Even if the author was just having fun and not actively flirting, accepting an invitation to a hotel room could be seen as inappropriate regardless of the ex status.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't respect the bride's boundaries and engaged in behavior that could be perceived as inappropriate given the setting. The fact that someone else initiated the interaction doesn't necessarily absolve them of responsibility in that context.\n"
