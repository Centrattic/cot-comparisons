It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that the person went to their ex's wedding, where the bride had told them not to hit on any women. The person didn't actively try to hit on anyone, but when a bridesmaid invited them to her hotel room, they accepted. Now the bride is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The writer attended their ex's wedding, which is a sensitive situation. The bride had clearly stated that they shouldn't hit on any women there. The writer says they weren't trying to pick up anyone, just having a good time. However, when approached by a bridesmaid, they went to her hotel room. \n\nThe key points here are consent and boundaries. The bride set a boundary, and the writer didn't break that by initiating contact. But by accepting the invitation, even if it wasn't their initiative, they might have crossed the line. The bride is upset because someone else initiated contact, but the writer didn't refuse. \n\nIt's important to note that the writer is at their ex's wedding, which is a public event, and the guests might be in a different mood. However, the writer's actions, even if not proactive, could be seen as participating in behavior that the bride wanted to prevent. The writer might argue they didn't violate the direct request since the woman approached them. But maybe the issue is that the writer didn't consider the bride's feelings and the appropriateness of the situation. \n\nIn social situations, sometimes respecting the wishes of the host is important, even if the actions weren't directly against the rules. The writer might have contributed to a situation that made the bride uncomfortable, regardless of who initiated the contact. So, even though they didn't start it, accepting the invitation could still be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nTherefore, while the writer didn't break the explicit rule, their actions might have shown a lack of consideration for the bride's feelings, making them partially at fault. So the answer would be A, yes, they are in the wrong.\n"
