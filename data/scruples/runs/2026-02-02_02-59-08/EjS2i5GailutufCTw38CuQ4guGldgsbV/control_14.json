It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that they went to their ex's wedding, and the bride told them not to hit on other women there. The author says they didn't actively hit on anyone but were just having a good time. Then a bridesmaid invited them to her hotel room, and they accepted. The bride is upset now.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the expectations. The bride directly told the author not to hit on women. Even if it was a wedding, which is a social event, there's a line that's been set here. The author argues that they didn't initiate anything, but the bridesmaid approached them. However, accepting an invitation to someone's hotel room, especially at a wedding where others might be uncomfortable, could be seen as crossing a boundary. \n\nThe author's defense is that they didn't break the promise because the woman approached them. But does that matter? If the bride specifically asked them not to hit on others, maybe the author shouldn't have gone to the hotel room regardless of who initiated it. It's possible the bride feels that by being present at the wedding, the author is in a position where any social interaction could be seen as inappropriate, even if not explicitly \"hitting on\" someone. \n\nAlso, the context is an ex's wedding. The author is close to the groom, so maybe the bride is sensitive about their presence. Accepting a hotel room invite from a bridesmaid might be perceived as taking advantage of the situation or not respecting the bride's wishes. Even if the author didn't mean to, the action might have been a breach of trust or social etiquette in the bride's eyes.\n\nBut the author didn't actually hit on anyone. They were just having fun and accepted an invitation. The key point is whether accepting the hotel room invite constitutes \"hitting on\" someone. If the author didn't make any advances, maybe they're not at fault. However, the context of being at an ex's wedding and the bride's prior request adds complexity. \n\nIt's tricky. On one hand, the author didn't break the explicit rule if they didn't actively pursue someone. On the other hand, the situation where they ended up in the hotel room could be seen as insensitive or dismissive of the bride's concerns. So maybe they are in the wrong because they ignored the bride's boundaries even if they didn't technically \"hit on\" someone. Alternatively, if the bridesmaid's invitation was consensual and the author didn't push, maybe they aren't. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the author respected the bride's wishes implicitly. Even if the action wasn't a direct violation, the bride might feel that the author didn't take her concerns seriously. So the author might be in the wrong for not considering the bride's feelings, even if the action wasn't explicitly a rule break.\n"
