It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about their ex's wedding. They were told not to hit on any women there. But then a bridesmaid invited them to her hotel room, and they went. The bride is upset now.\n\nFirst, the key points here. The person was warned beforehand not to hit on anyone. They said they weren't trying to pick people up but were just having a good time. Then a bridesmaid approached them and invited them to her hotel room. The person went along. The bride is mad, and the person is wondering if they're an asshole for not turning down the invite.\n\nHmm. The initial instruction was not to hit on women. The person didn't approach anyone, but when someone approached them, they accepted. The question is whether accepting a romantic invite from someone else at the wedding is wrong, especially since they were told not to initiate contact. \n\nI think part of the issue here is the context of the wedding. The bride is their ex's wedding, so there's a personal connection. Maybe the bride feels uncomfortable if someone from her ex's life is engaging in romantic activity, even if the person is the one who initiated. Also, the person might not realize that even if they weren't approaching others, accepting an invite could still reflect poorly on them, especially in that setting. \n\nAnother angle is whether the bride's request was reasonable. It's her wedding, and maybe she wanted to keep things respectful. The person might have thought that since they weren't the one approaching, it's okay. But maybe the bride's perspective is that any romantic interactions at her wedding are inappropriate, regardless of who initiates it. \n\nAlso, the person's ex is close to the groom, so their presence is justified. But their actions could affect the bride's day. Even if they don't think they're doing anything wrong, the bride's reaction is valid. The person might not see it as hitting on someone, but if it's causing discomfort, maybe they should have considered that. \n\nI'm leaning towards thinking the person is in the wrong because they didn't respect the bride's boundaries. Even if they weren't the one initiating, the situation could be seen as crossing a line in the context of a wedding. Maybe the person should have turned down the invite to avoid making the bride upset. So answer A.\n"
