It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding. The situation is a bit complex, so I need to consider all angles.\n\nFirst, the author's ex got married, and they were invited because they're close with the groom and his family. The bride told the author before the wedding not to hit on any women there. The author claims they didn't actively try to pick up anyone but were just having a good time. Then, a bridesmaid invited the author to her hotel room, and he accepted. The bride is upset now because the author didn't reject the invitation even though she was told not to hit on women. The author argues that the bridesmaid approached him, not the other way around.\n\nSo, the key points here are: 1) the bride's explicit request not to hit on women, 2) the author's actions of accepting the invitation, and 3) the author's defense that he wasn't the one initiating the attention.\n\nI need to assess whether the author violated the bride's request. The bride asked him not to hit on anyone, which could be seen as a boundary. Even if the bridesmaid approached him, by accepting the invitation, the author might be seen as complicit in the situation, regardless of who initiated the initial contact. The bride's upset could stem from feeling that the author didn't respect her boundaries, even if he didn't start the interaction. \n\nHowever, the author argues he didn't break the promise because the woman approached him. That's a valid point because he didn't initiate the contact. But the line between being polite and hitting on someone can be blurry. If the author was simply socializing and the invitation happened, maybe it's not entirely his fault. But the context of the wedding and the bride's specific instruction adds complexity. \n\nAnother angle is the ex relationship. The author's presence at the wedding as a guest might make the situation more sensitive. The bride could feel that the author, being close to the groom, should have been more cautious to avoid any appearance of impropriety. Even if the author didn't intend to hit on anyone, the fact that he went to her hotel room might be seen as crossing a line, regardless of who initiated it.\n\nBut the author's defense is that he wasn't hitting on anyone and that the invitation came from the bridesmaid. If the author didn't make advances, maybe he isn't in the wrong. However, accepting such an invitation at a wedding where the bride specifically asked him not to hit on women could be seen as disregarding her request, even if indirectly.\n\nIn terms of social norms, guests are often expected to respect the host's or bride's wishes, even if they're not the ones initiating the interaction. So, even if the author was polite and didn't make moves, accepting an invitation from a bridesmaid might still violate the bride's request. The author's responsibility here might be to honor the bride's boundaries, regardless of the other person's actions. Therefore, he might be in the wrong for not respecting her wishes, even if he didn't initiate the contact.\n"
