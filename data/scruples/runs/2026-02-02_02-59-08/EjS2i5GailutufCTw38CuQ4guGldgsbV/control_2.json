It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author went to their ex's wedding. The bride had told them beforehand not to hit on any women there. The author went to the wedding, had a good time, and ended up agreeing to go to a bridesmaid's hotel room when she invited them. Now the bride is upset.\n\nFirst, let's break down the key points. The author was told by the soon-to-be bride not to hit on women, which they found weird but agreed to. However, they didn't actively seek someone out; instead, a bridesmaid approached them. The author didn't see a problem because they didn't initiate the interaction. The bride is angry, and the author is questioning if they did something wrong.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether the author broke the promise they made to the bride. The author claims they didn't hit on anyone because someone else initiated the contact. But the bride is upset regardless. The user is asking if the author is an asshole for not turning down the invitation.\n\nI need to consider the context. The author was at their ex's wedding, which might already be a sensitive situation. Even though they weren't in a relationship anymore, the fact that they're close to the groom and his family adds another layer. The bride's request was direct: no hitting on women. The author might think that since the other person approached them, they didn't violate the rule. However, by accepting the invitation, they might be seen as participating in something that the bride found unacceptable. \n\nAnother angle is the perception of the bride. Even if the author didn't initiate, accepting the invitation could be seen as encouraging or engaging in behavior that the bride had asked them to avoid. The key here is whether the action (accepting the invitation) violates the initial promise. The author argues it's the other person's action, but maybe the bride's perspective is that the author didn't uphold their end of the agreement by not turning down the offer. \n\nIn social norms, sometimes even being approached by someone else at a wedding can be seen as inappropriate, especially when there's prior instruction not to engage in such behavior. The author's decision to go to the hotel room, regardless of who initiated, might be seen as disregarding the bride's feelings and the boundaries set. \n\nAlso, the fact that it's an ex's wedding might make the situation more delicate. The author might have thought they were being respectful by not actively flirting, but the action still caused harm. The bride's anger could stem from feeling that the author didn't take her request seriously, even if it wasn't an explicit hit on. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't honor the bride's boundaries as they had promised. Even if they didn't initiate the interaction, accepting the invitation could still be considered a violation of the agreed-upon behavior. The bride's perspective is important here, and the author should consider that their actions, regardless of intent, caused her distress. Therefore, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
