It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding.\n\nFirst, the writer went to their ex's wedding, which they were close with the groom and family. The bride told them not to hit on anyone, and the writer thought that was weird. Then, during the reception, a bridesmaid invited the writer to her hotel room, and they accepted. The bride is now upset, and the writer is wondering if they're an asshole for not rejecting the invite.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the bride's direct instruction not to hit on anyone, the writer's actions of going to the hotel room with a bridesmaid, and the writer's defense that the invitation came from the girl, not them. \n\nThe writer argues they didn't break the promise because the woman approached them. But the question is, is that a valid defense? The bride's instruction was a general one to not hit on anyone, so even if someone else initiates, does the writer have an obligation to decline? \n\nIn social contexts, especially at events like weddings, there's an unspoken rule to avoid romantic interactions, especially with people connected to the couple. Even if the invitation came from the bridesmaid, accepting it might still be seen as violating the bride's request and the social norms of the event. The writer might be in the wrong because they didn't respect the bride's boundary, even if they didn't initiate the contact. \n\nAlso, the writer was at their ex's wedding, which could be a sensitive situation. Their actions might be perceived as disrespectful to the bride, regardless of whether they initiated it or not. The fact that they went along with the invitation could be seen as taking advantage of the situation, even if they weren't the one who approached the woman.\n\nOn the other hand, the writer claims they weren't trying to pick anyone up and were just having a good time. They might argue that they were following the social norms of the wedding by mingling and dancing, and that the invitation was unexpected. However, the key issue here is the bride's specific request and the writer's response to it. Even if they didn't start it, participating in such an interaction might still cross the line she set.\n\nSo, considering the bride's explicit instruction and the potential for misunderstanding or disrespect, the writer might be in the wrong. The answer could lean towards A (Yes). But maybe there's a nuance where the writer didn't break the promise directly. However, the social context and the bride's feelings are important here. The writer's actions, even if not explicitly initiating, could still be seen as violating the spirit of the request. Therefore, the answer is likely A.\n"
