It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding. The situation is that the bride told the author not to hit on women at the wedding. The author went to the wedding, had a good time, and then a bridesmaid invited him to her hotel room. The bride is upset now.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is at their ex's wedding, which is a sensitive situation. The bride made a direct request not to hit on women, which the author thought was weird but agreed to. Then, a bridesmaid asked him to her hotel room. The author didn't initiate; the bridesmaid did. \n\nThe key points here are the bride's prior request and the nature of the interaction. The author didn't approach the bridesmaid, so maybe the initiation was from the other person. But the author still went along with it. The bride is upset, possibly because her bridesmaid's actions reflect on her, or she's concerned about the ex's presence at her wedding. \n\nFrom the author's perspective, they might feel they didn't break any promises since the other person initiated. However, the bride's request was a boundary, and even if the author didn't take it seriously, the action could still be seen as crossing that boundary. \n\nAlso, considering the sensitivity of exes at weddings, even if the author is not in a relationship now, their actions could be perceived as disrespectful to the bride, especially if the bride felt vulnerable. The fact that the author was close to the groom complicates things, as they might have a good relationship, but the bride is upset. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the bride specifically asked not to hit on women, and the author ended up in a hotel room with a bridesmaid, even if initiated by the other person, it could be seen as violating that agreement. The author might be in the wrong for not respecting the bride's wishes, even if they didn't initiate. Alternatively, if the author didn't explicitly agree to the request, maybe it's not their fault. But since the bride made the request, and the author didn't refuse the invitation, it's possible they are in the wrong. \n\nI think the answer would depend on whether the author's actions were a breach of the agreement. The author said they didn't hit on anyone but went to the hotel room with a bridesmaid. If the bride's request was a boundary, then the author's participation in that interaction, even if initiated by the bridesmaid, could be seen as violating the spirit of the request. So the author might be in the wrong (A). However, if the author didn't explicitly agree to avoid all interactions, maybe not. But given the bride's direct request, the author should have been more cautious. So I'm leaning towards A.\n"
