It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that the author went to their ex's wedding, and the bride had told them not to hit on any women. The author then ended up going to a hotel room with a bridesmaid. The main points are whether the author broke any promises and if the bride has a valid reason to be upset.\n\nFirst, the bride asked the author not to hit on any women at the wedding. The author claims they didn't actively seek someone out; the bridesmaid invited them. However, the key here is that the author agreed to go to the hotel room. Even if the invitation was initiated by the bridesmaid, the author's decision to accept that invitation could still be seen as going against the bride's wishes. The author might argue that they didn't \"hit on\" anyone, but the situation of going alone to a private setting with someone else's partner (or in this case, the bride's bridesmaid) could be problematic.\n\nThen there's the emotional aspect. The bride is upset, and the author is confused why. The author and the ex are no longer in a relationship, but the bride might feel that the author is still connected to the groom and that their actions reflect poorly on the event. The author's presence at the wedding was allowed because they were close to the groom and his family, so the author might have a responsibility to behave in a way that respects the bride's comfort. \n\nThe author's response to the bride's request could be seen as dismissive. Even if the author didn't intend to hit on anyone, the fact that they went to a hotel with a bridesmaid could be interpreted as crossing a line. The author might not have broken the exact words of the promise (since the bride didn't pick them up), but the situation's implications might still be offensive. \n\nAnother angle is the social norms and expectations at weddings. Attendees are expected to act respectfully, especially considering the couple's feelings. The author's actions, even if not explicitly hitting on someone, might have made the bride uncomfortable or caused embarrassment. \n\nSo, even if the author didn't have malicious intent, their actions could still be perceived as inconsiderate or disrespectful to the bride's wishes. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't prioritize the bride's feelings and the context of the event, leading to the bride's justified upset.\n"
