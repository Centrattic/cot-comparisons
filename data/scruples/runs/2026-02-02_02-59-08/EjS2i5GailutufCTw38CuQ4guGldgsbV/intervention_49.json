It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a guy who went to his ex's wedding, was told not to hit on women, and ended up going to a hotel room with a bridesmaid. The bride is upset, and the author is wondering if he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author was invited to his ex's wedding, which is understandable since he's close to the groom. The bride told him not to hit on any women before the wedding. He claims he wasn't actively trying to pick up women but was just having fun. A bridesmaid invited him to her hotel room, which he accepted. The bride is upset, and he's arguing that he didn't initiate it, so he didn't break his promise.\n\nNow, considering social norms and expectations. Even if the bride didn't have authority over him, it's common courtesy to respect boundaries set by the host, in this case, the bride. The fact that he was at a wedding, which is a family and friends event, might mean there's an unspoken expectation of appropriateness. Accepting an invitation to a hotel room, especially after being told not to hit on women, could be seen as crossing a line, regardless of who initiated it.\n\nAnother angle is the context of the ex relationship. Being at an ex's wedding can be tricky. He might have a history there, and his actions could be misinterpreted or cause discomfort, even if unintended. The bridesmaid's invitation might have been friendly or romantic, but in the context of a wedding, it's a sensitive situation. The author's acceptance could be seen as taking advantage of a moment, especially if it made the bride upset.\n\nAlso, the argument that he didn't initiate the invitation might not hold weight in the eyes of others. Socially, if someone invites you to a private setting, it's often considered a personal boundary issue, regardless of who started it. The fact that he didn't explicitly refuse could imply consent to the bride's expectations.\n\nHowever, there's a counterpoint. If the author wasn't actively hitting on women but was approached, maybe he's not the aggressor. But the problem is that the bride had made it clear he shouldn't be hitting on anyone, and his acceptance might have violated that. Even if the invitation came from the bridesmaid, he still participated in the action, which could be seen as disregarding the bride's request.\n\nIn terms of social norms, respecting the host's boundaries is important. The bride's request, even if not legally binding, is a social contract that he agreed to, albeit indirectly. By going to the hotel room, he broke that trust, leading to the bride's anger. The key here is the pre-established boundary versus the action taken. Whether the invitation was innocent or not, the author's choice to accept it in that context likely crossed the line, making him at least partially at fault.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the answer would lean towards A (the author is in the wrong). He should have considered the bride's request and the appropriateness of the situation, regardless of who initiated the invitation.\n"
