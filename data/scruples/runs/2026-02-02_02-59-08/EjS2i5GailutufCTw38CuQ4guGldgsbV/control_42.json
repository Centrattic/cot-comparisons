It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding. They were told not to hit on anyone, but they didn't initiate; the bridesmaid invited them. \n\nFirst, the bride is upset. Why? Maybe she feels it's inappropriate to have that kind of interaction at her wedding, especially since the person is an ex of the groom. Even if they didn't actively hit on someone, being in a hotel room with someone else's relative could be seen as crossing a line. The person might not have broken a direct rule, but they might have ignored the spirit of the request. The bride's concern could be about the appearance of impropriety or protecting her own comfort as the wedding host. \n\nAlso, the fact that the person is close to the groom might make the bride even more sensitive. Maybe the bride feels that the person is not respecting the event's sanctity. Even if the person was just having a good time, the outcome is that the bride is upset. The key here is whether the person's actions, regardless of intent, caused harm. Since the bride is clearly upset, the person might be in the wrong for not considering her feelings, even if they didn't break a specific rule.\n\nBut wait, the person didn't initiate the invitation. The bridesmaid approached them. So maybe the responsibility is on the bridesmaid? However, the person could have declined the invitation to avoid causing issues. They were warned not to hit on anyone, and maybe being in a hotel room with someone else's guest is still within the scope of that rule. Even if they didn't actively flirt, the situation could be seen as inappropriate. \n\nSo considering the bride's perspective and the potential for causing discomfort, the person might be in the wrong for not declining the invitation despite the bride's prior warning. Even if they didn't break the exact wording, they ignored the intent, leading to upset feelings. Therefore, answer A.\n"
