It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a guy at his ex's wedding who was told not to hit on women but ended up going into a hotel room with a bridesmaid. The author is wondering if they're an asshole for not turning her down.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The bride told him not to hit on women at the wedding. He agreed, thinking it was weird but respecting her wishes. At the wedding, he was socializing, not actively trying to pick people up. Then a bridesmaid invited him to her hotel room, and he went. Now the bride is upset.\n\nThe author's reasoning: he didn't initiate the contact; the bridesmaid did. But the bride is upset, and he's confused why. He's asking if he's an asshole.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether the author violated the bride's request by accepting the invitation, even if he didn't approach her first. The bride's request was to not hit on any women. The question is whether accepting an invitation from another person counts as hitting on someone. If the bride's rule was to avoid any romantic or sexual advances, even if initiated by others, then he did break the rule. But if the rule was to not initiate himself, then perhaps not. However, the bride might consider that being in a hotel room with someone as hitting on them, regardless of who invited whom.\n\nAlso, the social context: being at an ex's wedding, the sensitivity of the situation. Even if he didn't start it, accepting an invitation from a bridesmaid might be seen as taking advantage of the situation. The author's argument that he didn't break the promise because the woman approached him might be valid, but the bride could still feel violated by his compliance. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? If the bride's rule was that he shouldn't be involved in any romantic or sexual activities at her wedding, then accepting an invitation to a hotel room would violate that, even if he didn't approach her. Alternatively, if the rule was only to not approach others, then he might be in the right. But given that the bride is upset, and the author was aware of her request, he might be in the wrong for not respecting her boundaries, even if he didn't initiate the contact. \n\nAnother angle: the fact that he was drinking might be a factor, but that's not necessarily an excuse. Also, the author's closeness to the groom might mean he should have known better. The author's defense is that the woman approached him, but maybe he should have turned her down to avoid making the bride upset. \n\nIn social norms, even if someone invites you, accepting a romantic or sexual overture at someone else's wedding, especially when you were told not to hit on others, could be considered inconsiderate. So, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting the bride's wishes, regardless of who approached whom.\n"
