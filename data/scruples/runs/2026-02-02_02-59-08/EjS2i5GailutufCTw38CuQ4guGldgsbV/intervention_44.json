It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit-style post is in the wrong for not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding. The key points here are the context of the situation and the actions taken.\n\nFirst, the author attended their ex's wedding, which isn't unusual since they're close with the groom and family. The bride had explicitly told them not to hit on any women at the wedding. The author thought it was weird but agreed. However, during the reception, a bridesmaid invited them to her hotel room, and they accepted. Now the bride is upset.\n\nThe main issue here is the author's actions versus the bride's expectations. The author argues they weren't hitting on anyone and that the woman approached them. But the bride's main concern was the author not hitting on anyone, which they agreed to. Even if the invitation came from the bridesmaid, accepting it could still be seen as violating the agreed-upon boundary. The author didn't explicitly reject the invitation, which might be the crux of the problem.\n\nEven if the author wasn't intentionally hitting on women, the fact that they accepted an invitation from a bridesmaid could be seen as crossing a line, especially given the bride's prior request. The author's defense that they didn't initiate the interaction might not matter from the bride's perspective if the outcome still violated her comfort. Social norms often emphasize respecting boundaries, especially in sensitive situations like an ex's wedding.\n\nSo, considering the agreed-upon boundaries and the bride's emotional stance, the author might be in the wrong for not adhering to the request, regardless of their intent. Therefore, the answer is likely A.\n"
