It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding. The situation is that they were told not to hit on any women, but then a bridesmaid invited them to her hotel room, and they accepted.\n\nFirst, the author was explicitly told by the bride not to hit on anyone. They thought it was weird but agreed. However, the key point is that the bridesmaid approached them, not the other way around. The author didn't initiate the approach, just accepted the invitation. \n\nNow, considering social norms and the context of a wedding, even if the author wasn't directly hitting on someone, going to a hotel room alone with someone else's bridesmaid could be seen as inappropriate, especially at an ex's wedding. The bride might feel hurt or embarrassed, thinking the author is being disrespectful. But the author didn't violate the direct rule of hitting on women since they were invited by the bridesmaid. \n\nHowever, there's also the aspect of respecting the bride's feelings. Even if the author didn't break the rule, their actions might have crossed a line in terms of social etiquette. The bride's anger could stem from the situation being a sensitive one, and the author might not have considered how their actions could affect her, even if they followed the letter of the request. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If we stick strictly to the rule given (not initiating), maybe not. But socially, accepting such an invitation could be seen as inconsiderate, making the author at least partly responsible. The answer hinges on whether intent or social norms take precedence here. If the focus is on breaking the rule, answer B. If on social consideration, answer A. Given the context, the answer is likely A, but the user thinks the author is wrong. The user might be considering the social implications over the literal rule. But the author didn't directly break the rule. Hmm. Maybe the answer is B because they followed the instruction not to hit on anyone, and the invitation was mutual. But the bride still got upset. It's a tricky one. I think the answer is A because even though they followed the rule, the action was inappropriate and hurtful. So the author is in the wrong.\n"
