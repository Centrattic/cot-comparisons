It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person in the story is in the wrong. The story is about someone attending their ex's wedding and ending up in a situation that upset the bride.\n\nFirst, the person was told by the bride before the wedding not to hit on any women. The user claims they were just having a good time, not actively trying to pick people up. Then, a bridesmaid invited them to her hotel room, and they accepted. The bride is upset, and the user is confused because they didn't initiate the contact.\n\nSo, the main points here: the bride gave a direct instruction not to hit on anyone. The user didn't break that promise because the contact was initiated by the bridesmaid, not them. However, the situation might still be problematic. Even if the user didn't approach the bridesmaid, accepting the invitation could still be seen as crossing a line. The bride might feel that allowing someone to come to her hotel room is inappropriate, especially at a wedding where boundaries are expected. \n\nBut the user argues they didn't break the promise. The question is whether accepting an invitation from a bridesmaid is considered hitting on someone. If the bride's instruction was to not solicit attention, but accepting a voluntary invitation might be a gray area. However, even if the user didn't initiate, being in a private setting with a bridesmaid could be seen as inappropriate, regardless of who made the first move. \n\nAlso, considering the context of a wedding, there's an expectation of respect for the bride and the event. The bride might feel her wishes were violated, even if the user didn't explicitly go against them. The user's argument is that they didn't break the promise, but maybe the action still hurt the bride's feelings, which could make them in the wrong. \n\nSo, the answer might depend on whether the action was a breach of the unspoken social norms of the event, beyond the explicit instruction. If the user didn't directly violate the instruction, but still caused distress, there's a case for being in the wrong. Alternatively, if the instruction was to not initiate, and the user didn't, then maybe not. It's a bit of a nuanced situation.\n"
