It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves attending an ex's wedding, being told not to hit on anyone, and then ending up in a hotel room with a bridesmaid.\n\nFirst, the key points: The author was explicitly told by the soon-to-be bride not to hit on any women at the wedding. He agreed to that, but later accepted an invitation from a bridesmaid to her hotel room. He argues that he didn't initiate the approach, but he did go along with it. \n\nNow, considering social norms and expectations. Weddings are sensitive events, especially when there's a prior relationship involved. The bride's request was direct, so even if it seemed odd to the author, honoring that request would be expected. By going to the hotel room, he's effectively violating that boundary, regardless of whether he initiated the contact. The fact that the bridesmaid approached him doesn't absolve him of responsibility; he had a choice to accept or decline. \n\nAlso, the author's argument that he didn't break the promise because the woman approached him is weak. The promise was to not hit on anyone, not to avoid being approached. His presence in the hotel room could be seen as participating in behavior that the bride would find offensive, especially since it's an ex's wedding. \n\nThere's also the aspect of considering the feelings of the bride and the groom. Even if there's no romantic interest, actions taken at the wedding could affect the groom's family and friends. The author's actions might be seen as disrespectful to the bride's wishes and the overall atmosphere of the event.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, people are often held accountable for their choices, even when others make the first move. The author had the agency to say no. The fact that he didn't do so suggests he is in the wrong. \n\nPossible counterarguments: The author wasn't actively hitting on someone, just being social. Also, the bridesmaid's invitation complicates things. However, the main issue is respecting the bride's explicit request. Accepting such an invitation is a breach of that trust, regardless of who approached whom.\n\nSo, based on these points, the author likely is in the wrong. The answer would be A.\n"
