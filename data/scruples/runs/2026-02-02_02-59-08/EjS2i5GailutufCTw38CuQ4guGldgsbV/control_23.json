It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding.\n\nFirst, the context: the author went to their ex's wedding. The bride had told them beforehand not to hit on any women there. The author claims they weren't trying to pick people up but were just having a good time. The situation escalates when a bridesmaid invites them to her hotel room, and they accept. The bride is upset, and the author is questioning if they were wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are:\n\n1. The bride made a direct request to the author not to hit on anyone. Even though the author found it strange, they had agreed to the wedding invitation, so they were probably aware of the bride's expectations.\n\n2. The author says they were just mingling and not actively trying to pick people up. However, accepting an invitation to a hotel room from a bridesmaid could be seen as crossing a line, even if it wasn't initiated by the author. The bride's anger suggests that this action was a problem.\n\n3. The author mentions that the bridesmaid approached them, so they argue they didn't initiate the contact. But the fact that they accepted the invitation still matters. Even if it wasn't their idea, being in a vulnerable situation at a wedding where the bride had set boundaries might mean the author should have avoided it.\n\n4. The social norms here are important. Weddings are generally not the place to be engaging in romantic or sexual activities, especially with someone connected to the event. The bride's concern might be about the implications for her wedding and her ex's relationship, or perhaps for her own comfort and that of her family.\n\n5. The author's ex being close friends with the groom adds another layer. Their presence at the wedding could already be sensitive, and the author's actions might have upset the bride further, even if they were just having fun.\n\n6. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. The bride felt wronged, so from her perspective, it's a problem. The author argues they didn't break the promise because the girl approached them. But the reality is that accepting such an invitation could be seen as violating the spirit of the bride's request, even if the letter wasn't broken.\n\nIn terms of societal judgment, people often expect attendees of weddings to respect the hosts' boundaries. Even if the author didn't plan to hit on anyone, engaging in a situation that could be perceived as disrespectful to the bride (especially her close friend) is likely to cause offense. The key here is the breach of trust and respect towards the bride's wishes, even if the author's intentions were innocent. The author might not have intended harm, but the outcome did cause hurt, which is why people might side with the bride.\n"
