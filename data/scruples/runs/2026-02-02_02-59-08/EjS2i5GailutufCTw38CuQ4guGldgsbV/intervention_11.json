It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit-style question is in the wrong for not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding. The situation is a bit complex.\n\nFirst, the person went to their ex's wedding, which is already a sensitive situation. The bride (now ex's new wife, I guess) told them beforehand not to hit on any women at the wedding. The writer feels it's a bit odd that the bride would make that request, but they agreed. Now, during the reception, a bridesmaid invited them to her hotel room, and they accepted. The bride is upset about this.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the writer was warned not to hit on anyone, but they didn't actively go out to pick up women. The invitation came from the bridesmaid, not the writer. The writer argues that they didn't break the promise because it was the girl who approached them. The bride is angry, but the writer is confused why this is an issue.\n\nHmm. The writer might think they're in the clear because they didn't initiate any advances. But the bride's request was a direct instruction, and even if the invitation was from someone else, the writer still accepted. By going to the hotel room, they might be seen as participating in something that the bride wanted to avoid. Also, attending an ex's wedding can be tricky, especially if there's a history. The writer might not realize that the bride's request was to prevent any flirting or romantic interactions, even if initiated by others.\n\nBut then again, maybe the writer did follow the rule by not hitting on anyone themselves, and the situation was a mutual decision between them and the bridesmaid. However, the bride could still be upset because it's her wedding day, and she might feel uncomfortable knowing that someone from her ex's life is interacting intimately with another woman. The writer might not see it as their fault because they didn't start it, but the bride's request was to avoid any such situations entirely. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the writer respected the bride's boundaries. Even if they didn't initiate, accepting the invitation could still be seen as violating the spirit of the bride's request. The writer might not be in the \"wrong\" in a legal or explicit sense, but morally, they might have overstepped by not respecting the bride's wishes, even if indirectly.\n"
