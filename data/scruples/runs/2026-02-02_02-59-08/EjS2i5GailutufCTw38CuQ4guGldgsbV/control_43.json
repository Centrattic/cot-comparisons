It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding. The bride told them not to hit on anyone, but the person says they didn't initiate anything. The girl asked them to her hotel room.\n\nFirst, the main issue is the bride's request. She told them not to hit on anyone, which they thought was weird but agreed to. The person claims they weren't trying to pick up anyone, just having fun. Then a bridesmaid approached them, and they went to her hotel. \n\nSo, the question is: Did the person break their promise? The bride says they're upset, but the person argues that the girl initiated it. \n\nI need to consider if agreeing to go to someone else's hotel room counts as hitting on someone. If the person didn't approach the girl, but she invited them, maybe they didn't break the rule. But maybe the action of going to the hotel is still hitting on someone. \n\nAlso, the person is at their ex's wedding, so maybe there's an unspoken understanding to act respectfully. Even if the bride's demand was odd, the person chose to attend and might be expected to follow her rules. But if the girl initiated the interaction, does that absolve the person? \n\nIt's a bit of a gray area. The rules of social interactions can be subjective. The person didn't approach others, but accepting an invitation to a hotel room could be seen as participating in something the bride wanted to avoid. \n\nSo, depending on perspective, the person might be in the wrong for going along with the invitation, even if they didn't start it. Alternatively, since the girl initiated it, maybe they're not at fault. \n\nI think the key point is whether the person's actions violated the bride's request. If the request was to not hit on anyone, then any romantic or flirtatious behavior would be against that. Going to the hotel room is likely considered hitting on someone, regardless of who initiated it. So the person might be in the wrong. But if the person didn't approach and just accepted an invitation, maybe they're not. \n\nIt's a bit tricky. The answer might depend on cultural norms or how strict one interprets \"hitting on.\" Since the person didn't initiate, but still went along, they might still be seen as in the wrong. So answer A. But I'm not 100% sure. Maybe B.\n"
