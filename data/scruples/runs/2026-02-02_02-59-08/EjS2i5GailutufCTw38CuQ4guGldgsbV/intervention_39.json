Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not rejecting a girl at their ex's wedding. The situation is that the author was at their ex's wedding, which they were invited to because they're close to the groom and his family. The bride warned the author not to hit on any women, but the author didn't see a problem and ended up going to a hotel with a bridesmaid. Now the bride is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's actions. The bride made a direct request not to hit on women, and the author agreed. But then the author went to a hotel with a bridesmaid. The key points here are consent and boundaries. The author says they didn't initiate the approach; the bridesmaid invited them. However, the bride's request was to avoid hitting on women, which the author interpreted as not initiating, but the bride might have meant avoiding any romantic interactions entirely. \n\nAnother angle is the context of the ex's wedding. Even though the author is not the one who approached the bridesmaid, being at an ex's wedding and engaging in such behavior could be seen as insensitive. The bride might feel that the author is undermining the wedding's atmosphere or being inappropriate in general. \n\nAlso, the author's reasoning that they didn't break the promise because the woman approached them is a bit shaky. The bride's request was likely to prevent the author from making advances, not to restrict the actions of other guests. But by accepting the invitation, the author might have contributed to a situation that the bride found uncomfortable. \n\nIn social contexts, respecting someone's boundaries is important, even if you think you're not crossing a line. The bride's request, while perhaps strict, was a boundary she set. The author's action, even if not a direct breach of the promise, could be seen as disregarding her feelings. \n\nSo, the author might not be in the wrong in a strict sense, but they may have been inconsiderate. However, the question is whether they're an asshole. The term \"asshole\" in AITA contexts often relates to causing unnecessary hurt or being inconsiderate. Since the author didn't explicitly break the promise but still acted in a way that upset the bride, there's a case to be made that they're in the wrong for not respecting her feelings more carefully.\n"
