It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the person attended their ex's wedding. The bride told them beforehand not to hit on any women there. The author says they didn't actively try to pick up anyone but were just having a good time. Then, a bridesmaid invited them to her hotel room, and the author went along. The bride is upset now.\n\nFirst, the author was clear that they were told not to hit on women. Even though they say they weren't trying to pick people up, the fact that they went to a hotel room with someone else's bridesmaid might cross a line. The author argues that it was the bridesmaid who initiated the invitation, not them. But even if that's the case, accepting such an invitation at an ex's wedding, especially after a direct request not to hit on women, could be seen as disregarding the bride's feelings. \n\nThe key points here are respect and boundaries. The bride made a direct request, and the author's actions, while perhaps not aggressive in seeking attention, still led to a situation that could be perceived as violating that request. The bride's upset might not just be about the specific action but about the principle of respecting her boundaries. Even if the author didn't intend to hit on anyone, the situation they entered into could be seen as insensitive. So, the author might be in the wrong for not honoring the bride's explicit request, regardless of who initiated the interaction.\n"
