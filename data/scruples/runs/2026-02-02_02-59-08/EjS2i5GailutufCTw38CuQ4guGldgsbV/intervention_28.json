It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong for not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding. The key points here are the context and the expectations set by the bride.\n\nFirst, the person attended their ex's wedding, which is already a delicate situation. The soon-to-be bride had explicitly told them not to hit on any women, which the author found odd but agreed to. The author claims they weren't actively trying to pick up anyone but were just having a good time. Then, a bridesmaid invited the author to her hotel room, and they accepted. The bride is upset about this, and the author is questioning if they're an asshole for not rejecting the invitation.\n\nSo, the main issues are: 1) The author was at an ex's wedding, which might carry some emotional weight. 2) The bride had a direct request that they not hit on women there. 3) The author didn't initiate the interaction but accepted an invitation from a bridesmaid. \n\nThe author argues that they didn't break the promise because the woman approached them. But the bride is upset regardless. The question is whether the author is at fault here. On one hand, agreeing to go to someone's hotel room after a wedding could be seen as crossing a line, especially in this context. Even if they didn't initiate it, the location and the situation might make the bride feel uncomfortable. On the other hand, the author claims they were just having fun and didn't break the agreement because they weren't the one who approached.\n\nI think the key is the initial request from the bride. If she told them not to hit on anyone, and they agreed, then going to a hotel room with someone else, even if not initiated by them, might still be seen as violating that trust. The bride's perspective is important here. She might feel that any romantic interaction at her wedding, even with a guest, is inappropriate, especially given the ex's presence. The author's argument that they didn't break the promise technically might be valid, but the spirit of the agreement was to avoid any such situations. The fact that they went to a hotel room could be seen as ignoring the bride's wishes, making the author at fault.\n\nAlso, the social norms around weddings are such that guests are expected to be respectful and avoid anything that could make the couple uncomfortable. Even if the author didn't start the interaction, accepting the invitation could be seen as inconsiderate. The bride's anger is justified because she made a direct request, and the author's actions might undermine her comfort and trust. So, the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
