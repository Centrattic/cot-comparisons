It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. So the user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author's ex got married, and they were invited because they're close to the groom and his family. The bride told them beforehand not to hit on any women at her wedding. The author says they didn't go around picking people up; they were just having a good time. Then, a bridesmaid invited them to her hotel room, and the author agreed. Now the bride is upset, and the author is wondering if they're an asshole.\n\nHmm. Let's think about the key points here. The bride made a direct request not to hit on anyone. The author claims they didn't go looking for it, but someone approached them. However, even if the bride didn't ask to be approached, the fact that a bridesmaid invited them over might still be problematic. The author's presence at the wedding was probably not seen as appropriate for approaching anyone, especially since it's the ex's wedding. Also, the author's ex might feel sensitive about their past relationship, and any interaction with someone else could be seen as inappropriate, even if it's just a friend.\n\nBut the author argues that they didn't break the promise because the girl approached them. However, the bride's concern is about the author approaching others, not necessarily being approached. Even if it's the other way around, if the author accepted the invitation, that could still be seen as violating the spirit of the bride's request. Plus, being in a wedding setting where the attendees are friends and family, it's possible that the bride feels the author is overstepping boundaries by engaging in intimate behavior with someone else.\n\nAnother angle is the social norms around weddings. While weddings are social events, they can be a sensitive time for the couple. The author's ex is married now, and interacting with others, especially in a way that could be seen as romantic or sexual, might be considered in poor taste. The author might not have intended to hurt anyone, but the bride's feelings are valid here. The fact that the author was part of the groom's close circle might mean their actions could affect the groom's standing as well.\n\nSo, considering the bride's explicit request and the social context, the author's decision to accept the invitation could be seen as inconsiderate. Even if the girl approached them, the author's agreement to go to her room could be viewed as crossing a line. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting the bride's wishes and for engaging in potentially inappropriate behavior at the wedding.\n"
