It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding. \n\nFirst, context: The person was at their ex's wedding. The bride had previously told them not to hit on women there. The author claims they weren't actively hitting on anyone but were just enjoying the party. Then, a bridesmaid invited them to her hotel room, and they accepted.\n\nThe bride is upset. The author argues that the bride's anger is strange and that they didn't break their promise because the woman approached them first.\n\nHmm. The key points here are consent and mutual agreement. If the author didn't initiate the invitation, but accepted an invitation from someone else, does that make a difference? But the bride had given a direct instruction not to hit on women, which the author agreed to. So even if they didn't approach the woman, accepting an invitation could still be seen as violating that agreement. \n\nThe bride's perspective is important. She felt the need to set boundaries, so by her standards, the author's action crossed that line. Even if the author didn't actively hit on someone, accepting the invitation might still be seen as participating in behavior she wanted to prevent. The author might not have meant to harm, but they did act in a way that upset her. \n\nAlso, the social context of a wedding is a sensitive place. Even if the author was close to the groom, being at an ex's wedding adds another layer. The bride might feel that any attention given to other women, even if not initiated by the author, could be awkward or disrespectful. \n\nBut the author didn't explicitly break a promise, since they didn't hit on anyone themselves. It's a bit of a gray area. However, considering the bride's request and the outcome, the author's action, while not directly violating the promise, might still be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nSo, maybe the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they disregarded the bride's boundaries, even if indirectly. The key is respecting the bride's request and avoiding any actions that could cause her discomfort, even if the action wasn't exactly what was forbidden.\n"
