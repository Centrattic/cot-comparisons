It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author went to their ex's wedding. They were told by the bride not to hit on any women there. The author says they weren't trying to pick anyone up, just having fun. Then, a bridesmaid invited them to her hotel room, and the author went. Now the bride is upset.\n\nFirst, the author was warned beforehand not to hit on anyone. They agreed, so maybe there's an expectation they'd follow that. But they didn't initiate the interaction; the bridesmaid did. The author accepted the invitation. The question is whether that makes them the asshole.\n\nHmm. The bride might feel that the author is still violating the agreement by not turning her down, even if the invitation came from the bridesmaid. The author argues they didn't make the approach. But maybe being at the wedding, especially of an ex, there's a social expectation to avoid any romantic entanglements. The author's ex's wedding is a sensitive event, so their presence might be already awkward. Accepting a hotel room invitation could be seen as inappropriate regardless of who initiated it. The bride's reaction might stem from feeling that the author is disrespecting her event or their past relationship. \n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't explicitly promise not to accept advances, just not to hit on others. If the bridesmaid approached them, maybe it's not the same as the author being the one to make moves. However, the author's presence and participation in the invitation could still be seen as crossing a line, especially in the context of the wedding. The bride's upset is about the behavior that violates the boundary she set, whether or not the author initiated it. \n\nSo, considering the situation, even if the author didn't start it, by accepting the invite, they might have contributed to the bride's discomfort. Social norms in such events often expect attendees to be respectful, especially after an ex's wedding. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting the bride's boundaries, even if the invitation came from someone else. The answer would be A (Yes).\n"
