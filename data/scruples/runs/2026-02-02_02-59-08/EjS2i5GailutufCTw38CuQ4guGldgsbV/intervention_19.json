It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" story is in the wrong. The situation is about the author attending their ex's wedding, being warned not to hit on anyone, and then ending up in a situation where a bridesmaid invited them to her hotel room, which upset the bride.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author was told explicitly by the soon-to-be-bride not to hit on anyone at the wedding. The author claims they didn't go out of their way to hit on women but were just having a good time. However, when approached by the bridesmaid, they accepted the invitation. The bride is upset, and the author is defending their actions by saying it was the woman who approached them, not the other way around.\n\nNow, breaking down the key points: \n\n1. The bride gave a direct instruction. Even though the author might find it weird, they did agree to the condition. By accepting the invitation, even if it was initiated by the bridesmaid, the author is still engaging in behavior that the bride wanted to prevent. \n\n2. The author's argument is that they didn't actively seek out someone to hit on, but they did accept an invitation that could be seen as inappropriate. The line between socializing and hitting on someone can be blurry, especially in a wedding setting where emotions and expectations are high. \n\n3. The fact that the author is at their ex's wedding adds another layer. Even if they are close with the groom, the bride might feel uncomfortable seeing an ex there. The author's actions could be perceived as insensitive or disrespectful, especially since the bride had made her stance clear beforehand.\n\n4. The author's defense about not breaking the promise is a bit shaky. They didn't go out of their way, but accepting an invitation to a hotel room is a clear action that aligns with hitting on someone, regardless of who initiated it. The author's presence and acceptance could still make the bride feel that the author is ignoring her boundaries.\n\nConsidering these points, even if the author didn't actively seek someone out, the fact that they went to the hotel room with a bridesmaid after being warned suggests they disregarded the bride's request. The author's actions could be seen as crossing a line, especially in a sensitive setting like a wedding. So, while it's not the author's intention to be disrespectful, their actions did lead to the bride being upset. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because they didn't honor the bride's explicit request and participated in behavior that caused discomfort.\n"
