It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a wedding where the person's ex got married, and the soon-to-be bride told him not to hit on women. He didn't actively try to pick up anyone but ended up going to a bridesmaid's hotel room with her invitation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The bride made a direct request not to hit on any women. The author claims he didn't break the promise because the bridesmaid approached him, not the other way around. The bride is upset, and the author is confused why it's a problem.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether the author is in the wrong for accepting the invitation to the hotel room. Even if the bridesmaid approached him, the bride's rule was about not hitting on women. The author was at a wedding where the bride made clear boundaries. Accepting a romantic or sexual invitation, even if initiated by someone else, might be seen as violating that boundary. The author was in a social setting where respecting the bride's wishes is expected, especially when she directly asked. The fact that he was at his ex's wedding might add to the sensitivity, as there could be underlying emotions or expectations of restraint.\n\nOn the other hand, the author claims he wasn't actively trying to hit on anyone. The bridesmaid invited him, so he didn't solicit the attention. But the key is whether the author's action of going to her hotel room is considered hitting on her. If the act of accepting such an invitation is seen as part of \"hitting on\" someone, then he did break the promise. However, if \"hitting on\" is only initiating the approach, then perhaps the author didn't. But in social norms, accepting such an invitation might be seen as complicit in the behavior the bride wanted to avoid.\n\nAnother angle is the context of a wedding. Guests are expected to behave respectfully, especially regarding the bride and her close friends. The bride's request, even if it seemed odd, was a boundary set for the event. Disregarding that, even if the action wasn't directly initiated by the author, could still be considered inconsiderate or disrespectful to the bride's wishes.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the author was given a clear instruction not to hit on women. By accepting an invitation to a hotel room from a bridesmaid, even if she initiated it, he might have violated that instruction. The bride's upset reaction makes sense if she felt he disrespected her boundaries. Therefore, the author could be seen as in the wrong because he didn't uphold the bride's request, regardless of who initiated the interaction. The answer might be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
