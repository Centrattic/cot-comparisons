It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding. The situation is that the author was invited to their ex's wedding, and the bride told them not to hit on any women. The author didn't go out of their way to pick someone up, but someone approached them at the end of the reception and invited them to her hotel room, so the author agreed. The bride is upset now.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The bride made a direct request not to hit on anyone. The author claims they didn't initiate the attention but was approached. However, even if the woman approached them, the author chose to accept the invitation. The question is about whether that makes the author an asshole.\n\nFrom a social etiquette perspective, attending a wedding, especially of an ex, requires some sensitivity. The bride's request, while perhaps unusual, is meant to avoid any appearance of impropriety. Even if the author didn't start the interaction, accepting the invitation could still be seen as disrespectful, given the context. The bride might feel that the author is undermining her authority or the sanctity of her wedding weekend. The fact that the author was close to the groom and his family might add to the sensitivity, as their actions could be seen as affecting the family's dynamics.\n\nAdditionally, the author's argument that they didn't break their promise because the woman initiated it is debatable. The bride's rule was about not hitting on anyone, which could be interpreted as avoiding any romantic or sexual advances, regardless of who initiated it. The author's acceptance could still violate that spirit. \n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't actively seek out attention, so maybe it's not their fault entirely. However, in such situations, it's often better to err on the side of caution and respect the bride's wishes to prevent any potential issues. The author's decision to go to the hotel room with someone, even if invited, might not be the best choice in that context.\n\nConsidering all this, even if the author didn't start the interaction, their decision to accept the invitation could be seen as inconsiderate. Therefore, the answer would likely be that the author is in the wrong.\n"
