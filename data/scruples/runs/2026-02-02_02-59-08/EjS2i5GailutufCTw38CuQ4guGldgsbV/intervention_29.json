It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author attending an ex's wedding, where the bride had previously told him not to hit on any women. The author claims he didn't initiate any advances, but a bridesmaid invited him to her hotel room, which he accepted. Now the bride is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is at a wedding where the bride is his ex's new wife. He was friends with the groom and attended the wedding. The bride had directly told him not to hit on any women, which he agreed to. But during the reception, a bridesmaid invited him to her hotel. The key point here is whether the author was the one who approached the bridesmaid or if she approached him. The author says the bridesmaid invited him, so he didn't initiate. However, the bride is upset regardless.\n\nNow, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author argues that he didn't break his promise because the woman approached him. But the bride is still upset. The problem here might be about perception. Even if the author didn't initiate, the fact that he accepted an invitation from a bridesmaid could be seen as inappropriate, especially given the context of being at a wedding where the bride had a prior request. Weddings are sensitive events, and even if there's no explicit rule against it, social norms often expect attendees to behave with a certain level of respect towards the bride and groom, especially if there's a prior relationship (ex-partner).\n\nAnother angle is the direct request from the bride. Even if it's unusual for her to make such a demand, the author had agreed to it. By accepting the invitation, even if he didn't approach the bridesmaid, he might have violated the bride's request, which could be why she's upset. The author might be dismissing the bride's feelings by thinking it's strange for her to be upset, but the bride's perspective is valid in that she wanted to avoid any discomfort for her new husband or herself.\n\nAdditionally, the fact that the author is an ex and attending a wedding where he's close to the groom adds another layer. It's possible that the author's presence was already a sensitive issue, and his actions, even if not directly against his promise, could be seen as crossing a line. The author might not have realized the importance of respecting the bride's boundaries to avoid causing tension.\n\nSo, considering all these points, even though the author didn't initiate the interaction, accepting the invitation might still be seen as inconsiderate. The bride's feelings are valid, and the author's actions could have caused unnecessary stress. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting the bride's request and the social context of the event.\n"
