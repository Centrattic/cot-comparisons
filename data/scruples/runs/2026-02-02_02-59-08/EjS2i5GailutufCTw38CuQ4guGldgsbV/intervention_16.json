It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the key points from the story. The person's ex got married, and they were invited because they're close to the groom and his family. The bride told them not to hit on any women at the wedding. The person claims they weren't hitting on anyone, just enjoying the party. Then, a bridesmaid invited them to her hotel room, and they accepted. The bride is upset now.\n\nThe person is defending themselves by saying they didn't break the promise because the bridesmaid approached them, not the other way around. They're confused why the bride is upset.\n\nSo, the main issues here are consent and boundaries. The bride made a direct request that they shouldn't hit on anyone. Even if the person wasn't actively trying to pick up women, accepting an invitation from a bridesmaid could still be seen as crossing that boundary. The bride might feel that any interaction leading to a romantic or sexual encounter, even if initiated by someone else, violates her request.\n\nAlso, the fact that it's a wedding adds another layer. Weddings are sensitive events, especially when an ex is involved. The person's presence might already be a point of tension. Even if they're not the one initiating, their acceptance could be seen as insensitive or disregarding the bride's feelings.\n\nHowever, the person argues that they didn't initiate the interaction. But the request was explicit: don't hit on anyone. By accepting the invitation, they might have still violated that agreement, regardless of who initiated the contact. The bride's request could be about maintaining a certain atmosphere and avoiding any potential for jealousy or discomfort among guests.\n\nAnother angle is the concept of consent and respect. Even if the person thinks their actions are harmless, if someone else (the bride) is upset by it, then they might need to consider the impact of their actions. The key here is whether they respected the bride's request, even if they didn't see it as hitting on someone.\n\nSo, putting it all together, even if the person didn't actively seek out someone to flirt with, accepting an invitation that leads to a private encounter might still be seen as violating the bride's wishes. The author's defense that they didn't break the promise because the other person approached them might not hold, because the request was about not hitting on anyone, which could include engaging in such interactions regardless of who initiated it.\n\nTherefore, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't respect the bride's explicit request, even if their actions were initiated by someone else. The bride's feelings and boundaries should be considered, and the author's actions could be seen as dismissive of those boundaries.\n"
