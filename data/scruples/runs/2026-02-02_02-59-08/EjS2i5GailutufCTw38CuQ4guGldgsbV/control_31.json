It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not turning down a girl at a wedding. The situation is a bit complicated, so I need to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the context: The author is at their ex's wedding. They were close to the groom and his family. The bride told them not to hit on anyone at the wedding. The author didn't actively seek out anyone, but during the reception, a bridesmaid invited them to her hotel room, and they accepted. Now the bride is upset.\n\nThe author's defense is that they didn't break their promise because the woman approached them, not the other way around. They also question why it bothers the bride so much.\n\nSo, the key points here are: 1) The promise made by the bride to not hit on anyone. 2) The author's actions where they accepted an invitation from a bridesmaid. 3) The bride's reaction.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong, I need to consider the social norms and the specific agreement made. The bride asked them not to hit on anyone. The author didn't initiate the interaction; a bridesmaid did. But the author did accept the invitation. Even if they didn't approach the woman, by accepting her invitation, they might be seen as engaging in behavior that the bride wanted to avoid. \n\nThe line between being a passive participant and engaging in flirtation can be blurry. If the author had any intention of going to the hotel room, that could be seen as hitting on someone, even if the woman initiated. The bride might feel that allowing any such interactions is a breach of her request, regardless of who initiated it. \n\nAlso, the context of an ex's wedding adds another layer. The author is in a sensitive situation, and their actions could be seen as disrespectful to the bride, especially since they had an ex relationship. Even if the author didn't break the promise technically, the perception might still be that they didn't respect the bride's boundaries. \n\nSo, while the author didn't actively seek someone out, accepting an invitation to a hotel room in that setting could still be considered inappropriate. The bride's request was to avoid hitting on any women, and the author's acceptance of the invitation might be seen as going against that. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting the bride's explicit request, even if it was the woman who approached them.\n"
