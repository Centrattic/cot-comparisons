It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author attending their ex's wedding, getting invited to a bridesmaid's hotel room, and the bride being upset.\n\nFirst, there's the context of the wedding. The author's ex got married, and the author is close with the groom and his family. The bride had specifically told the author not to hit on any women at the wedding. The author claims they didn't actively try to pick up anyone but ended up accepting an invitation from a bridesmaid. The key point here is whether the author violated the bride's request.\n\nThe bride is upset, but the author argues that the invitation came from the bridesmaid, not them. However, the initial request from the bride was to not hit on anyone. The author might think that since they didn't initiate the approach, they're in the clear. But the issue is that the author accepted the invitation, which could be seen as participating in behavior the bride asked them to avoid. \n\nIt's important to consider the social expectations at a wedding, especially when there's a prior relationship with the bride. Even if the author didn't initiate, accepting the invitation might still come across as insensitivity towards the bride's feelings. The author might not have broken the explicit promise (since the bride asked not to hit on people, and the author didn't initiate), but the implicit expectation is to avoid any such interactions to respect the bride's wishes and the event's solemnity.\n\nAlso, the fact that the author was at their ex's wedding adds another layer. The bride might feel uncomfortable with the presence of the ex, even if they're friends with the groom. The author's actions, even if not aggressive, could be perceived as undermining the bride's authority or disregarding her boundaries.\n\nIn terms of social norms, even if the author didn't do anything explicitly wrong, the act of accepting an invitation to a hotel room could be seen as crossing a line. Weddings are supposed to be joyous events for the couple, and the author's behavior might have caused unnecessary tension. The author might not be in the wrong legally or by strict definitions, but socially and morally, they might be seen as insensitive or inconsiderate.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the answer would likely be that the author is in the wrong. They agreed to the bride's request not to hit on anyone, and while they didn't initiate the interaction, accepting the invitation still contributed to the bride's discomfort. The key is about respecting the bride's wishes and the event's context, even if the action wasn't explicitly forbidden.\n"
