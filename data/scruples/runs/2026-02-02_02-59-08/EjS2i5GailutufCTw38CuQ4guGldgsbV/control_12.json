It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding. The situation involves some context: the author was attending their ex's wedding, and the soon-to-be bride had previously told them not to hit on any women there. The author claims they weren't trying to pick up anyone but accepted an invitation from a bridesmaid to her hotel room, which led to the bride being upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points. The bride made a direct request that the author not hit on women, and the author agreed. However, the author argues that the bridesmaid approached him, so he didn't initiate the contact. The key here is whether the author's actions violated the agreement they made with the bride. Even if the bridesmaid invited him, accepting that invitation could still be seen as going against the bride's wishes, especially since it might have been perceived as hitting on her. \n\nThe author's defense is that they didn't actively seek out the interaction, but the bride's perspective is that the outcome was offensive. In relationships and social contexts, respecting someone's boundaries is crucial. Even if the action wasn't intentional, the result was that the bride was upset, and the author might be in the wrong for not honoring her request. However, there's also a nuance here about whether the author's actions were actually against the agreement. The bride asked him not to hit on women, but if he was approached and didn't reciprocate the advances, maybe he didn't break the promise. But accepting the invitation could still be seen as crossing a line, regardless of who initiated the contact. \n\nAnother angle is the social etiquette at weddings. Even if the bride's demand seemed odd, refusing to comply with her request could be viewed as disrespectful. The author's close relationship with the groom might mitigate some blame, but the bride's feelings are still important. It's possible that the author didn't intend to cause harm, but the consequences of their actions upset the bride. In such cases, taking accountability might be necessary, even if they believe they followed the rules. \n\nSo, considering the situation, the author might be in the wrong because they accepted an invitation that led to the bride's distress, even if they didn't initiate it. The line between social interaction and hitting on someone can be blurry, and the bride's perspective is valid. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
