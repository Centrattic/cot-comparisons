It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author attending their ex's wedding, where the bride had told them not to hit on any women. The author went to a hotel room with a bridesmaid after the reception, and now the bride is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The bride made a direct request that the author not hit on any women. The author claims they didn't initiate the interaction; the bridesmaid invited them. However, by accepting the invitation, the author might be seen as participating in a romantic or sexual situation, which could be what the bride is upset about.\n\nThe author's defense is that they didn't break the promise because the woman approached them. But the problem is that even if the woman invited them, the author's decision to go along could be perceived as hitting on someone. The bride might feel that the author didn't respect her boundaries, even if the author didn't start the conversation.\n\nAlso, considering the context of an ex's wedding, there might be lingering emotions or sensitivity. The bride's request could be to maintain her family's comfort or to avoid any drama. The author's actions might have caused embarrassment or upset to the ex and her family, which could be why the bride is angry.\n\nI should also think about social norms here. At a wedding, guests are expected to behave respectfully. Even if the author wasn't actively trying to flirt, engaging in a private meeting with another guest might be seen as inappropriate, especially after the bride explicitly asked them not to. The fact that the author went to the hotel room, regardless of who initiated, could be the issue. \n\nSo, the question is whether the author respected the bride's request. If the request was to avoid any romantic advances, then even accepting an invitation from someone else might be against that. The author might be in the wrong for not heeding the bride's warning, even if they didn't initiate the interaction. The key is whether the action violated the agreed-upon boundaries. The answer here would likely be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they didn't honor the bride's request, leading to her upset.\n"
