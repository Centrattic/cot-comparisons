It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author attended their ex's wedding. The bride had told them beforehand not to hit on any women at the wedding. The author didn't actively try to pick someone up, but during the reception, a bridesmaid invited them to her hotel room, and they accepted. Now the bride is upset.\n\nFirst, the key points are: the author was warned not to hit on anyone, they didn't go out of their way to approach others, but someone approached them. The author's defense is that they didn't initiate the interaction. The question is whether that makes them in the wrong.\n\nI think the bride's request was clear. Even if the author didn't actively solicit attention, accepting an invitation from someone else might still be seen as going against the bride's wishes. The bride might feel that the author is still engaging in behavior that could be inappropriate at her wedding, regardless of who initiated it. Also, the fact that the author was at their ex's wedding adds another layer of sensitivity. The bride might be trying to protect her partner's feelings, and the author's presence and actions could be causing discomfort.\n\nBut then again, if the author wasn't the one initiating and was just being social, maybe it's not entirely their fault. However, the bride specifically asked them not to hit on anyone, so there's an expectation they should have respected that even if someone else approached them. The author might not have broken a promise directly since they didn't go up to someone, but the context of the wedding and the prior agreement could still mean they're in the wrong.\n\nHmm. So maybe the answer is A (yes) because the author didn't respect the bride's boundaries, even if they didn't initiate the interaction. The bride's request was to not hit on anyone, and by accepting the invitation, they might have violated that. But I'm a bit split because the author didn't go out of their way. Still, respecting the bride's wishes is important, so maybe they did cross a line.\n"
