It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding. The situation involves the author attending a wedding, being told by the bride not to hit on any women, and then accepting an invitation to a hotel room from a bridesmaid.\n\nFirst, the context is that the author is at their ex's wedding. The bride specifically asked them not to hit on any women there. The author claims they weren't trying to pick up anyone but were enjoying the party. Then, a bridesmaid invites them to her hotel room, and they accept. The bride is upset about this.\n\nThe author argues that they didn't break their promise because the girl approached them. The question is whether they were wrong to accept the invitation. \n\nFrom a social perspective, when someone is told not to hit on others, it's about respecting boundaries. The author didn't initiate the invitation; the bridesmaid did. However, the author chose to go along with it. Even if they didn't approach her, accepting the invitation might still be seen as crossing the bride's boundaries. The bride's request is to avoid any flirting or romantic overtures, and going to a hotel room could be seen as a significant breach, regardless of who extended the invitation. \n\nThe author might be in the wrong because they could have respected the bride's request by not engaging in any situation that could be perceived as inappropriate. Even if the invitation was from someone else, the author's decision to accept it might not have considered the bride's feelings and the potential implications for the wedding's atmosphere. \n\nOn the other hand, if the author didn't initiate the contact and was simply following the other person's lead, some might argue they're not at fault. But in terms of respecting the bride's direct instruction, the author's lack of action to avoid the situation could be seen as disregarding her wishes. So the answer might lean towards A (author is in the wrong).\n"
