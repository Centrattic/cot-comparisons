It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a wedding where the author, who is an ex of the bride, attended. The bride had previously told him not to hit on any women at her wedding. The author didn't actively approach anyone but ended up going to a hotel room with a bridesmaid.\n\nFirst, the key points are: the bride gave a direct instruction, the author didn't initiate the contact, but the bridesmaid approached him. The bride is upset now. The question is whether the author is wrong for not turning her down.\n\nI need to consider social norms and expectations. Even if the author didn't approach her, accepting an invitation to a hotel room might be seen as inappropriate, especially at a wedding involving his ex. Weddings have certain etiquette, and people might expect attendees to avoid certain behaviors to prevent awkwardness or hurting feelings. The bride's instruction was specific, so not following it might breach her trust or make her uncomfortable, regardless of who initiated it. \n\nAlso, the fact that he's close to the groom and the family adds another layer. His actions could affect the groom's family's feelings. Even if he didn't break her exact words (\"hit on any women\"), being invited to a hotel room by a bridesmaid might still be within the spirit of what she meant. The author might not see it as hitting on, but others might view it as inappropriate. \n\nSo, while the author didn't initiate the contact, the situation could still be seen as crossing a line. The bride's reaction is valid because she set boundaries, and the outcome might affect her wedding experience negatively. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting the implied boundaries of the situation.\n"
