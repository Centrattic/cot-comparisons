It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that they went to their ex's wedding, which they were invited to. They had a good time, drinking, mingling, dancing. The bride told them before the wedding not to hit on any women there. The author didn't consciously try to pick up anyone, but during the reception, one of the bridesmaids invited them to her hotel room, and the author accepted.\n\nNow, the author is being asked if they're an asshole for not turning down the girl at the ex's wedding. The key points here: the author didn't actively approach anyone, but they accepted an invitation from a bridesmaid to her hotel room. The bride is upset, but the author argues that the bridesmaid approached them, not the other way around. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of being at an ex's wedding. Even though the author is close with the groom and family, the wedding is a sensitive event. The bride's request was a direct warning about not hitting on her women, which the author took as a promise they didn't break. However, the fact that a bridesmaid invited the author to her hotel room is a different scenario. Even if the author didn't initiate the contact, accepting such an invitation could be seen as inappropriate in this setting. \n\nWeddings are public events where people are celebrating the couple, and the bride might feel that any romantic interaction, even if initiated by someone else, could be a breach of the unspoken social norms. The author might not have been hitting on the bridesmaid, but going to her hotel room alone could be misinterpreted or make the bride and groom uncomfortable. It's often considered inconsiderate to engage in flirtatious behavior or be alone with someone of the opposite sex at a wedding, especially when the bride has already expressed her concerns. \n\nAlso, the author's reasoning that they didn't break the promise because the girl approached them might be valid, but the action itself (accepting the invitation) still could cross a line. The question is about whether they are in the wrong, and that's about how their actions made others feel. Even if they didn't intend to violate the bride's request, the outcome did upset her. \n\nSo, while the author might not have had bad intentions, the situation is a bit of a gray area. Social etiquette often expects people to avoid situations that could be perceived as inappropriate, regardless of who initiated the contact. The author's not turning down the invitation might be seen as insensitive, considering the wedding context and the bride's prior statement. Therefore, there's a chance they are in the wrong, but it's also debatable. However, in these kinds of scenarios, people usually advise against being in private with someone from the wedding unless it's a family member or close friend. The author's acceptance could be viewed as crossing that line, making them the asshole even if they didn't technically break the promise. \n\nSo the answer is A.\n"
