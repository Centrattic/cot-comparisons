It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about not turning down a girl at a wedding. \n\nFirst, the person went to their ex's wedding. The bride told them not to hit on any women there. The writer claims they weren't trying to pick people up but were just having fun. Then a bridesmaid invited them to her hotel room, and they accepted. The bride is upset, and the writer is wondering if they're an asshole for not rejecting the invitation.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the bride's explicit request not to hit on anyone, the writer's actions in accepting the invitation, and the context of the ex's wedding. The writer argues that they didn't initiate the approach, so they didn't break the promise. \n\nBut wait, the bride asked them not to hit on anyone. If a bridesmaid approached them and invited them to her room, does that matter? The writer's argument is they didn't approach her. But the bride might still be upset because someone approached the writer, and the writer accepted. Even if the writer didn't initiate, the action of going to the hotel room could be seen as violating the spirit of the bride's request. \n\nAlso, attending an ex's wedding can be tricky. The writer might think they have the right to attend since they're close with the groom, but the bride's feelings are still important. The writer might not realize that even if they weren't hitting on others, being in that environment with an ex's spouse present could cause issues. \n\nThe bride's anger could stem from feeling that the writer isn't respecting her boundaries. Even if the writer didn't approach, the fact that they went along with the invitation might have caused her embarrassment or discomfort. The writer might be in the wrong because they didn't consider the bride's perspective and the potential impact of their actions, even if they didn't break a direct rule. \n\nSo, considering the context and social expectations, the answer might be A (they're in the wrong) because they didn't respect the bride's boundaries beyond just not hitting on people, including being cautious about interactions with others at the wedding.\n"
