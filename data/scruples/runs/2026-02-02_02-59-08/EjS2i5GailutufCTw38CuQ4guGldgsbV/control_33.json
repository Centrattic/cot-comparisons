It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves an ex's wedding where the writer was told not to hit on any women. The bride is upset because the writer went to the hotel room of a bridesmaid.\n\nFirst, the writer was clearly warned by the bride before the wedding not to hit on anyone. Even though he didn't approach anyone, he ended up going to a hotel room with a bridesmaid. The key point here is that the bride asked him to avoid hitting on women, which he agreed to. However, being invited to a hotel room by the bridesmaid might be seen as crossing a boundary, even if he wasn't the one initiating it. \n\nThe writer argues that he didn't break his promise because the woman approached him. But the problem is that accepting an invitation to a hotel room, especially after being told not to hit on anyone, could be perceived as violating the spirit of the agreement. Even if he wasn't the one making the advances, he still accepted the invitation, which the bride finds offensive. \n\nAdditionally, the context is an ex's wedding. The presence of the ex and her family might make the situation more sensitive. The bride's reaction might be partly about protecting her event and avoiding awkwardness for her ex's family. \n\nSo, considering the warning given, the writer's acceptance of the hotel room invitation could be seen as inconsiderate, even if he wasn't the one initiating the interaction. The bride's anger is about maintaining the boundaries she set. Therefore, the writer might be at fault for not respecting those boundaries, even if he didn't directly hit on someone.\n"
