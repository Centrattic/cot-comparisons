It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding. The situation is a bit tricky.\n\nFirst, the ex's wedding. The groom is close to the author, and the bride made it clear before the event that he shouldn't hit on anyone. The author claims he didn't actively try to pick up women but was just having a good time. Then, a bridesmaid invited him to her hotel room, and he accepted. The bride is upset because of this. \n\nThe main points of contention are: 1) Did the author break his promise to the bride? 2) Is he responsible for accepting the invitation, even if initiated by the bridesmaid? \n\nThe author argues he didn't initiate the situation, but he did agree to go to the hotel room. Even though the bride told him not to hit on anyone, the author didn't explicitly hit on the bridesmaid. However, accepting such an invitation at a wedding, especially after being warned, could be seen as crossing a line. The bride's perspective is important here; she might feel that by going to the hotel room, he violated the spirit of her request, even if not the letter. \n\nFrom a social standpoint, there's an unspoken rule about respecting the host's wishes, especially in sensitive situations like an ex's wedding. The author might not have broken any direct rule, but his actions could have been perceived as disrespectful. The bride's anger could stem from feeling that the author didn't take her request seriously, leading to her discomfort or embarrassment. \n\nSo while the author didn't explicitly hit on someone, the act of going to the hotel room with a bridesmaid might be seen as inconsiderate. Whether he's in the wrong depends on how one views the intention behind the invitation and the respect for the bride's boundaries. Given the context, there's a case for him being in the wrong because he didn't respect her boundaries by engaging in a situation that could be seen as inappropriate. Answer A.\n"
