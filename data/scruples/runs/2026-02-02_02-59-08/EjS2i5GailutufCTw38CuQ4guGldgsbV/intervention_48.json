It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author attended their ex's wedding. The bride had told them beforehand not to hit on any women at the wedding. The author says they didn't intentionally hit on anyone, just had a good time, but then a bridesmaid invited them to her hotel room and they accepted. Now the bride is upset.\n\nHmm, the key points here are the pre-wedding warning from the bride and the subsequent action. The author argues that they didn't break the promise because the bridesmaid approached them. But the bride is upset. So the question is whether the author should have turned down the invitation, even if it was initiated by the bridesmaid.\n\nFirst, the bride had made a clear request not to hit on any women. Even if the author wasn't actively trying to hit on people, the fact that they accepted an invitation from a bridesmaid could still be seen as violating that request. The line between \"militating and dancing\" and \"being hit on\" might be blurry, but the bride probably wanted to avoid any romantic interactions. By going to the hotel room with a bridesmaid, the author might have crossed that line. \n\nAlso, the author is still close with the ex's family, so their actions could affect those relationships. Even if the author didn't intend to break the promise, the perception is that they did. The bride's feelings are valid because she felt disrespected. The author might argue they were just being social, but the bride's request was clear, and respecting that is important. \n\nSo, even if the author didn't approach someone, accepting the invitation could still be seen as inconsiderate. The answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong because they didn't heed the bride's request, leading to her upset. So I think the answer is A.\n"
