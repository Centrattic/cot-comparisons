It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves an ex's wedding where the person was told not to hit on any women. But then a bridesmaid invited them to her hotel room, and they went along. The bride is upset now.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The person was at their ex's wedding, which is a sensitive situation. The bride had explicitly told them not to hit on any women, so there's a prior agreement. The person claims they didn't actively pursue anyone but were just having a good time. Then, when approached by the bridesmaid, they accepted the invitation. The question is whether this makes them an asshole.\n\nOn one hand, the person didn't initiate the situation. They were approached. But they were at their ex's wedding, which is a specific context. The bride had set a boundary, and even if the person didn't approach, accepting the invitation could still be seen as violating that boundary. The bride's reaction is about trust and potential embarrassment. Even if they weren't in a relationship with the bride, the context of the ex's wedding adds complexity.\n\nBut from the person's perspective, they didn't break the promise directly. They were invited, not the other way around. However, the problem here isn't just about the initial promise. The bride might feel that even accepting a romantic invitation from someone else at her wedding is crossing a line, regardless of who initiated it. The sensitivity of the situation (being an ex's wedding) might mean that the person's presence in a romantic context with others could be seen as inappropriate, even if they're not in a relationship with the bride.\n\nAlso, the fact that they were drinking and mingling might have led to a situation where they didn't consider the implications. The key issue is whether the person respected the boundaries set by the bride. Even if the invitation came from the bridesmaid, the person could have chosen to decline to avoid causing the bride distress. Accepting it, despite the prior agreement, might be seen as disregarding the bride's feelings and the specific context of the event.\n\nSo, the author is in the wrong because they didn't respect the boundaries set by the bride, even if they didn't initiate the contact. The sensitivity of the situation requires more consideration, and their actions could be perceived as violating the trust and respect owed to the bride during her wedding.\n"
