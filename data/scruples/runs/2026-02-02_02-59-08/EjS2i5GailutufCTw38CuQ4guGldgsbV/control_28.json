It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding. The situation is that the author was told by the bride not to hit on any women at the wedding. The author went, had a good time, and ended up being invited to a bridesmaid's hotel room. The bride is upset, and the author is defending their actions by saying the girl approached them and they didn't make a move first.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the expectations. The bride explicitly told the author not to hit on anyone. Even if the author wasn't actively trying to pick people up, the fact that a bridesmaid invited them to her hotel room might be seen as crossing a line, especially since it's the ex's wedding. The author might have ignored the bride's request, which could be why the bride is upset. \n\nThen there's the dynamic of the ex relationship. The author was close to the groom and family, so maybe the presence at the wedding was more about being part of the wedding rather than personal reasons. However, the author's actions might have made the bride uncomfortable, even if they didn't intend to hit on her. \n\nAlso, the author mentions that the bridesmaid approached them, but the author accepted the invitation. Even if it wasn't initiated by the author, accepting such an invitation could still be seen as violating the bride's request. The bride's request was a direct boundary, and crossing it, regardless of who initiated the interaction, might be considered inconsiderate.\n\nAnother angle is social etiquette at weddings. Weddings are family events, and even though the author was friends with the groom, engaging in such behavior might be seen as inappropriate regardless of the bride's explicit request. The author might have overstepped, even if they didn't realize it.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the author was told not to hit on anyone, the bridesmaid invited them, and the author went along. The bride is upset because her request wasn't respected. The author might be in the wrong for not honoring the bride's wishes, even if they didn't make the first move. The key here is respecting boundaries set by others, especially in a sensitive event like a wedding where the bride is likely to be more vulnerable or sensitive about such things.\n"
