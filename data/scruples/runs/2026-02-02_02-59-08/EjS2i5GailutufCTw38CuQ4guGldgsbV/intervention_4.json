It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a wedding where the person's ex got married, and they were invited. The bride asked them not to hit on women, and the person ended up going to a bridesmaid's hotel room. The person is wondering if they made a mistake by not turning down the invitation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The person is at their ex's wedding. They're close to the groom and family, so attending makes sense. The bride specifically told them not to hit on women. The person claims they weren't hitting on anyone, just having a good time. Then a bridesmaid invited them to her hotel room, and they went. The bride is upset now.\n\nThe key points here are the prior request from the bride and the actions taken. The person says they didn't break the promise because the woman approached them. But the bride is upset regardless. The question is whether the person is in the wrong.\n\nFrom a social standpoint, weddings are sensitive events, especially when exes are involved. The bride made a direct request, probably to avoid any awkwardness or to maintain her own comfort. Even if the person claims they weren't hitting on anyone, the fact that they accepted an invitation to a hotel room could be seen as crossing a boundary. The person's defense is that it was the bridesmaid who initiated, but the bride's concern might be about any such behavior, regardless of who approached whom.\n\nAlso, the person's ex is getting married, so there's an inherent tension. The bride's request might be to prevent any potential issues that could make the event uncomfortable for her or the groom. The person's action, even if they didn't intend to hit on someone, might still be perceived as inappropriate given the context. The fact that they went to a hotel room with a bridesmaid, even if it was a mutual decision, could be seen as violating the spirit of the bride's request, which was to avoid such situations entirely.\n\nHowever, the person argues that the invitation was from the bridesmaid, so they didn't initiate it. But the responsibility isn't just about initiation; it's about respecting boundaries set by the bride. The person might have thought they were being polite by accepting, but if the bride asked them to avoid such interactions, then any interaction leading to a private setting could be a problem.\n\nIn terms of social norms, attending an ex's wedding and respecting the current spouse's boundaries is important. Even if the person wasn't actively looking to flirt, their presence and actions could still cause discomfort. So, the person might be in the wrong for not considering the bride's feelings and the situation's sensitivity.\n"
