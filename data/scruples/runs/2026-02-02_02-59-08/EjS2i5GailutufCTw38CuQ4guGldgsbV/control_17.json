It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The person is asking if they're an asshole for not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding. The situation is that they were told not to hit on anyone at the wedding by the soon-to-be-bride. Then, a bridesmaid invited them to her hotel room, and they went. The bride is upset, but the author doesn't see why because they didn't initiate it.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if the author broke their promise. The bride told them not to hit on any women. The author says the bridesmaid approached them, so he didn't initiate. But maybe the problem is that by accepting the invitation, even if the other person approached first, he still participated in the interaction. The bride might feel that by not turning down the invitation, he was still hitting on someone, even if it was the other person who made the first move. \n\nAlso, the context is the ex's wedding. Maybe the bride is sensitive because it's her wedding, and even if he's ex, she might feel that any romantic interaction at the wedding is inappropriate, regardless of who initiated it. The author's actions could be seen as disrespectful to the bride's wishes, even if technically he didn't break the promise. \n\nAnother angle: the bride's demand was about not hitting on any women. The author might argue that he wasn't hitting on anyone, but if he accepted an invitation to a hotel room, that could be seen as hitting on the bridesmaid. So maybe he did break the promise. \n\nBut then again, maybe the author's actions weren't about hitting on the bridesmaid but just having fun. However, the key point is whether the bride's request was clear. If she explicitly told him not to hit on anyone, and he went to a hotel room with a bridesmaid, that's a clear violation regardless of who initiated. \n\nSo the answer might be that the author is in the wrong because he violated the bride's direct instruction, even if he didn't approach the woman first. Therefore, he is an asshole (A).\n"
