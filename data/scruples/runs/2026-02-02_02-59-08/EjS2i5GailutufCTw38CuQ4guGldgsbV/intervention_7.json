It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not turning down a girl at an ex's wedding. The situation is that the author was told not to hit on any women at the wedding, but a bridesmaid invited them to her hotel room, and the author went along. Now the bride is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is at their ex's wedding, which is a sensitive situation. The bride specifically told them not to hit on women, so there was a clear expectation set. The author claims they weren't trying to pick people up, just having a good time. But when the bridesmaid approached them, they agreed to go to her hotel room. \n\nThe key points here are consent and expectations. The bride's request was a boundary, and while the author didn't initiate the contact, accepting the invitation could still be seen as crossing that boundary. Even if the author didn't start it, the bride might feel violated because her request wasn't respected. Also, being at an ex's wedding adds emotional complexity. The author might have thought they were just socializing, but the action of going to a hotel room with someone else's friend could be perceived as inappropriate, regardless of intent.\n\nAnother angle is the social norms around weddings. Weddings are supposed to be joyous events for the couple, and guests are expected to respect the couple's wishes. The author's actions, even if not malicious, might have made the bride uncomfortable or undermined her authority in setting boundaries. The fact that the author is close to the groom might make it even more personal for the bride, as she might feel the author is in a position of trust.\n\nHowever, the author didn't ask for the invitation, so they might argue they didn't take the initiative. But in social contexts, accepting such an invitation can still be seen as complicit. The line between socializing and inappropriate behavior is thin, especially in a wedding setting. The author's defense that they weren't hitting on anyone but were just having fun doesn't fully address the bride's perspective. The bride's distress is a valid reaction if she felt her boundary was crossed.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author's actions, even if not intentional, might be seen as disregarding the bride's clear request, thus being in the wrong. The answer would be A.\n"
