It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author went to their ex's wedding. The ex's bride had told the author beforehand not to hit on any women at the wedding. The author went to the wedding, had a good time drinking and mingling, and then ended up going to a hotel room with a bridesmaid. The bride is upset now, and the author is asking if they're an asshole for not turning down the girl.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author was invited to the wedding, and they're close to the groom and his family. The bride made a direct request not to hit on anyone, which the author found odd but agreed to. Then, the author didn't actively seek out someone but was approached by a bridesmaid and went with her. The key points here are the prior agreement and the circumstances of the interaction.\n\nThe bride's main issue is that the author went to the hotel room with someone. Even though the author claims they didn't initiate it, the fact remains that they didn't refuse when asked. The bride might feel that by not turning down the invitation, the author violated her trust or the agreed-upon boundary. The author might argue that they didn't break the promise because it wasn't their idea. But from the bride's perspective, someone showing up at a wedding and then going off with someone else, even if not initiated by them, could be seen as crossing a line, especially since the author was previously in a relationship with the bride and is now an ex.\n\nAnother angle is the social norms around weddings. Weddings are typically considered a time for celebration without romantic overtures, especially if someone is an ex of the person. The author's presence there could be sensitive, and their actions might cause discomfort for the bride. Even if the author didn't break the explicit rule (since the approach came from the bridesmaid), the implicit social expectation might have been breached. \n\nAlso, the fact that the author was drinking might be a factor. Alcohol can lower inhibitions, but it doesn't excuse actions that might be perceived as disrespectful. The bride might feel that the author's presence and subsequent actions could affect her special day, leading to her anger. \n\nSo, considering the prior agreement, the sensitivity of being at an ex's wedding, and the potential impact on the bride's feelings, the author might be in the wrong by not honoring the implicit and explicit boundaries set by the bride. Even if the author didn't take the initiative, their decision to accept the invitation could still be seen as violating the trust and the bride's wishes. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
