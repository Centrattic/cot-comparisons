It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The person is attending their ex's wedding, which they're close to the groom and his family. The bride had told them beforehand not to hit on any women there. The user says they're not trying to pick anyone up but are just having fun. Later, a bridesmaid invites them to her hotel room, and they accept. The bride is upset now.\n\nFirst, the key points: The user was warned not to hit on others, but they didn't approach anyone. The bridesmaid initiated the invitation. So, did the user do something wrong? The user might argue they didn't break the promise since the woman came to them. However, the bride is upset regardless. \n\nBut the user was at their ex's wedding. Even if the bridesmaid approached, accepting might still be problematic. The bride's request was to avoid hitting on anyone, which could include any form of attention from the user. The user might not have intended to flirt, but being in a situation where they're alone with another woman at the wedding, especially after the bride's warning, could be seen as crossing a line. \n\nThe user's actions, while not directly breaking the promise, might still be considered inconsiderate. The bride's feelings are valid if she feels the user is still being inappropriate despite her warning. The user might not be the villain, but there's a gray area here. The main question is whether the user respected the bride's boundaries. Since the user accepted an invitation to a hotel room, even if initiated by the bridesmaid, it could be seen as not respecting the bride's wishes. So, the answer would be A (author is in the wrong) because they didn't honor the bride's request by being in a private setting with another attendee, even if not initiated by them.\n"
