It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that he went to his ex's wedding, the bride told him not to hit on any women, and then a bridesmaid invited him to her hotel room. He accepted, and now the bride is upset. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The ex got married, and he's close to the groom. The bride told him beforehand not to hit on women. He went to the wedding, was having a good time, and when the reception was ending, a bridesmaid asked him to her hotel. He accepted. The bride is now angry.\n\nThe author's defense is that he didn't initiate the invitation; the woman approached him. Also, he didn't break his promise because it was her who picked him up. The question is whether he's an asshole for not rejecting her.\n\nSo, considering social norms, weddings are big events where people might be more sensitive. Even though he wasn't actively trying to hit on anyone, accepting an invitation to a hotel room with a bridesmaid could be seen as crossing a line. The bride felt it was a problem, so even if he didn't start it, being in a private setting with someone else's bridesmaid might be perceived as inappropriate, especially at an ex's wedding. \n\nAlso, the fact that the bride directly told him not to hit on women suggests she was concerned about his past behavior. By accepting the hotel invite, he might have disregarded her boundaries. Even if it was the woman's idea, he could have chosen to decline to avoid causing hurt. \n\nIn terms of social etiquette, it's often expected to respect others' wishes, even if they're not legally binding. So turning down the invitation might have been the respectful choice, even if he wasn't in a relationship. \n\nSo, while the author might not have broken any explicit rule (since he didn't approach her), he did engage in a situation that could be seen as violating the implicit boundaries set by the bride. Therefore, he might be in the wrong for not considering her feelings and the sensitivities of the occasion.\n"
