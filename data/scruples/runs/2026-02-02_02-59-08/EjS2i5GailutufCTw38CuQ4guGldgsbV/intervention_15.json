It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the scenario is in the wrong for not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding. The key points here are the ex's explicit instruction not to hit on any women and the situation that followed.\n\nFirst, the bride told the author before the wedding not to hit on any women. That's a clear boundary set by the bride. The author agreed, perhaps out of courtesy or to avoid conflict, but then later accepted an invitation from a bridesmaid to her hotel room. Even though the author claims they didn't initiate the approach, accepting the invitation could still be seen as crossing the bride's boundary. \n\nThe bride's anger might stem from the perceived disrespect towards her wishes, even if the author didn't approach someone. The fact that the author didn't explicitly reject the invitation suggests they went along with it, which might have made the bride feel her request was ignored. \n\nAlso, considering the context of an ex's wedding, the author's actions could be seen as insensitive. The bride might feel vulnerable or sensitive, and the author's presence and subsequent actions could add to her stress. Even if the author wasn't actively trying to hit on someone, going to the hotel room with a bridesmaid could be interpreted as taking advantage of the situation or not respecting the bride's boundaries. \n\nThe user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong, which aligns with the idea that respecting others' boundaries is important. The author did agree not to hit on anyone, so accepting an invitation that could be seen as violating that agreement, even if not directly initiated, might still be considered a breach of trust or respect.\n"
