It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding. The scenario is that the author was told by the bride not to hit on any women, but when a bridesmaid invited him to her hotel room, he accepted, and now the bride is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author was at their ex's wedding, which is a delicate situation. The bride had specifically asked him not to hit on women, so there's a prior agreement. The author claims he didn't go out of his way to pick up anyone but was invited by a bridesmaid. However, accepting an invitation to a hotel room could be seen as inappropriate regardless of who initiated it.\n\nThe main issue here is the context of the wedding. Weddings are personal events, and even though the author is close to the groom, the bride's request was to avoid hitting on women. The author might argue that the invitation was mutual, but the problem is that the situation could still cause embarrassment or discomfort, especially for the bride. Even if he didn't approach her, being in a hotel room with someone else's friend or family member might be seen as crossing a line.\n\nAlso, the fact that the author is at an ex's wedding adds another layer. People might expect some level of restraint to avoid awkwardness or potential conflicts. The bride's anger could stem from feeling that the author is not respecting her wishes or the sanctity of her wedding event.\n\nFrom a social perspective, even if the author didn't actively pursue someone, accepting an invitation that could be perceived as flirtatious or inappropriate in that setting might be considered inconsiderate. The bride's direct request suggests she was concerned about such situations, so not honoring that could be seen as disregarding her feelings.\n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't explicitly promise not to accept invitations, just not to hit on women. If the bridesmaid approached him, maybe he had no way of knowing her intentions. But given the prior warning from the bride, he should have been more cautious. The line between socializing and inappropriate behavior can be blurry, but in a sensitive setting like a wedding, it's better to err on the side of caution.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong because he didn't respect the bride's specific request, which could have been to prevent any awkward situations. Even if he didn't initiate the interaction, the outcome upset the bride, which is a valid concern. Therefore, the answer would be A.\n"
