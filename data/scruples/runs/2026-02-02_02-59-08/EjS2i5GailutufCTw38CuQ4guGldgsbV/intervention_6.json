It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not turning down a girl at his ex's wedding. The situation is that the bride told him not to hit on any women at the wedding, and he agreed. However, he ended up going to a bridesmaid's hotel room at the reception's end.\n\nFirst, the key points are: the author had an explicit request from the bride not to hit on anyone. He agreed to that. Then, he went to a hotel room with a bridesmaid. The author argues that he didn't initiate the interaction; the bridesmaid invited him. Also, he's close to the groom and attended the wedding as a friend.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? The bride's request was specific: don't hit on any women. The author didn't set out to hit on anyone, but he did accept an invitation to a hotel room, which is a clear boundary crossed. Even if he wasn't actively seeking to pick someone up, accepting such an invitation could be seen as violating the bride's wishes. The fact that the bridesmaid initiated it doesn't necessarily absolve him, because he still chose to accept. The bride might feel that regardless of who initiated, it's inappropriate in the context of her wedding. The author's ex is the groom, so he's there as a friend, and his actions might upset the bride and groom, even if he's not in a relationship anymore.\n\nOn the other hand, he wasn't actively hitting on anyone, just being social. But the hotel room part is a big deal. The bride's request was to not hit on any women, which is a clear boundary. The author not respecting that could be seen as crossing a line, even if he's not in a relationship with the bride anymore. So, considering the explicit request and the fact that he went to the hotel room, he might be in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
