It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not turning down a girl at their ex's wedding. The situation is that the author attended their ex's wedding, was told not to hit on other women, and then ended up going to a hotel room with a bridesmaid. The bride is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The ex's wedding is a sensitive event. The author is close to the groom and family but still an ex. The bride told him not to hit on others, which he agreed to. However, a bridesmaid invited him to the hotel room. \n\nThe key points here are consent and the initial agreement. The bride made a direct request, so the author did agree not to hit on others. The question is whether the author's actions violated that. The author says the bridesmaid invited him, so he didn't approach her. But does that matter? The fact that he accepted the invitation might still count as hitting on someone, even if he didn't initiate it. \n\nAlso, the bride's reaction is important. She's upset because of the situation, maybe feeling uncomfortable or that boundaries were crossed. The author's defense is that he didn't approach her, but the result is the same as if he had. \n\nAnother angle: attending an ex's wedding can be tricky. Even if the author is close to the groom, the bride might feel it's inappropriate for him to be flirting at the wedding. The author might not see it as a big issue, but the bride's feelings are valid. \n\nSo, was the author in the wrong? He did agree not to hit on others, and by accepting the invite, he might have broken that promise. Even if he didn't initiate it, accepting could still be seen as violating the agreement. The bride's anger is a result of that. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because he didn't respect the bride's wishes, regardless of who initiated the interaction.\n"
