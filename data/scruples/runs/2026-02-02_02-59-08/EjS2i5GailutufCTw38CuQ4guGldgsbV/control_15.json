It was kinda weird but I am really close with the groom and frankly his whole family so it wasn't that surprising.\n\nBut a couple of days before the wedding the soon to be bride told me that I wasn't allowed to hit on any women at her wedding. Which I thought was really weird to make such a direct demand but whatever it was her wedding.\n\nSo at the wedding I am having a good time, I am drinking, mingling, and dancing and just having a good time. I am not out trying to pick up anyone but I am having a good time. As the reception is winding down one of the bridesmaids asked me what my plans were for the night and invites me to her hotel room and I agreed.\n\nThe bride is now pretty pissed at me. 1 I don't know why it bothers her so much, seems strange and 2 I didn't break my promise, she picked me up not the other way around.\n\nSo am I an asshole for not rejecting a girl at my ex's wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a wedding where the author's ex got married, and he was invited because he's close with the groom and his family. The bride told him not to hit on any women at the wedding. The man went to the wedding, had a good time, and then a bridesmaid invited him to her hotel room, which he accepted. Now the bride is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The bride made a direct request that he not hit on women. The man didn't explicitly hit on anyone, but a bridesmaid invited him to her room. The man didn't initiate it; he accepted the invitation. The question is whether he's in the wrong by not rejecting her.\n\nFrom the bride's perspective, she might feel that he's disrespecting her by being flirtatious or engaging in behavior that could be seen as inappropriate, even if it wasn't her. The man argues he didn't break his promise because the woman approached him. But the bride's instruction was to not hit on anyone, which could include accepting invitations from others. \n\nHowever, the man was there on good terms with the groom's family, and the bride's request might have been overreaching. The act of going to the hotel room with a bridesmaid might be seen as crossing a line, regardless of who initiated it. Even if he didn't start it, being in a compromising situation could still be problematic in the context of the wedding.\n\nOn the other hand, the man didn't actively pursue others; he just accepted an invitation. But the bride's anger could stem from feeling that he's showing disrespect towards her wedding by engaging in such behavior. The man's actions might not have been intentional to upset her, but the perception matters here. \n\nSo, whether he's in the wrong depends on the context of the bride's request and societal expectations. If the bride specifically asked him not to hit on anyone, then accepting an invitation from someone else could be seen as violating that boundary, even if he didn't initiate it. Therefore, the man might be in the wrong for not respecting the bride's wishes, even if the action wasn't his initiation.\n"
