It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a friend (Annie) who had an affair, and the author suggested a paternity test to their friend Frank, which led to the discovery that the child isn't his. Now, Frank and the author are being shunned by their families.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author's main action was suggesting the paternity test. The question is whether that was wrong. Let me break it down.\n\nAnnie and Frank were married, and Frank was away a lot for work. The author noticed something off but didn't have direct proof of Annie cheating. The author then, after a few beers, mentions the paternity test. Frank later insists on getting a test, which reveals the child isn't his. The author is now being blamed by their family for ruining the marriage.\n\nSo, the author's intention was to help Frank, maybe to prevent him from being a cuckold or to address the emotional cheating. But the result was a broken marriage and family estrangement. Was the suggestion justified?\n\nOn one hand, the author might think they were helping Frank realize the truth. On the other hand, the author didn't have concrete evidence, just a feeling. The paternity test is a big step, and the author might have overstepped by bringing it up without more proof. Also, the author's suggestion was taken seriously, leading to the breakup. \n\nBut Annie did emotionally cheat, so maybe the marriage was already in trouble. The author's action exposed the infidelity, which might have been a necessary but painful outcome. However, the author didn't approach it carefully, maybe. They didn't confirm the suspicion properly and acted on a feeling after drinking, which could be seen as careless.\n\nAlso, the author's family is blaming them for causing the breakup. The author is defending their stance that Annie was at fault. But from an outside perspective, the author's role is to confront their friend about the cheating, but the method might be questionable. \n\nIn some perspectives, the author isn't wrong because they were trying to help Frank. In others, they shouldn't have meddled without evidence. The answer might depend on cultural views on infidelity and the appropriateness of the author's intervention. If the author had evidence or if Annie was clearly cheating, then maybe it's justified. But since it was just a feeling, maybe the author overstepped.\n\nI think the answer here is A (the author is in the wrong) because they acted on suspicion without proof, possibly causing unnecessary harm. Even if Annie was cheating, the author's method of addressing it might have been inappropriate, leading to consequences that could have been handled differently. The author didn't have the right to push Frank into a paternity test based on a hunch, which ended up breaking the marriage. So they share some responsibility.\n"
