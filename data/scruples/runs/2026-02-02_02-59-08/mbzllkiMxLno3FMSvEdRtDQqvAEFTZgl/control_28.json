It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about someone (the author) who supported a husband, Frank, who was cheated on by his wife Annie. The author's sister figure, Annie, had a child that wasn't Frank's. The author suggested a paternity test, which led to the discovery and the breakup.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if the author did something wrong. The author didn't know for sure that Annie was cheating; they just had a feeling. They asked Frank about a paternity test after some beers, which led to him taking action. The question is whether the author's suggestion was the right thing to do.\n\nAnnie was emotional cheating, and the child isn't Frank's. The author's intention might have been to help Frank get the truth. But by suggesting the test, the author might have caused the breakup and the fallout. However, Annie was the one who was unfaithful and had a child with someone else. The author's family is blaming them for ruining the marriage.\n\nIs the author at fault? Well, the author didn't know for sure. They had a suspicion and tried to help Frank verify. If Frank had found out later without the test, maybe the situation would have been worse. But by bringing up the idea, the author might have accelerated the break, causing immediate issues. However, the root problem is Annie's infidelity and deceit. The author's action was based on concern for Frank, even if it was based on a hunch.\n\nThe user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The options are A or B. The author's intention was to help a friend (Frank) uncover the truth. The mistake might be in suggesting the test without more evidence, but given that Annie was emotionally unfaithful, maybe the author wasn't wrong. The answer might depend on cultural or personal views on intervening in others' relationships. From a moral standpoint, if the author had a legitimate concern and tried to help, maybe they're not wrong. But if they overstepped, maybe A. However, considering the deceit from Annie, B might be correct.\n"
