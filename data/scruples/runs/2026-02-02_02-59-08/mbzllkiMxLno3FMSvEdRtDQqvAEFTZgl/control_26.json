It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves Frank and Annie's marriage, where Annie was cheating, leading to Frank discovering the baby isn't his. The author, who's Annie's brother, suggested the paternity test, which caused the marriage to fall apart. The question is whether the author is wrong for supporting Frank.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author has known Annie since childhood and is close to her. Frank's job keeps him away for two weeks at a time. The author suspected Annie was cheating but didn't have concrete evidence. When the baby came along, the author, during a drunken conversation, suggested a paternity test. Frank later insisted on getting one, which confirmed the baby wasn't his. Now, the author is being criticized by family for ruining the marriage and is being isolated. He believes Annie was at fault and that the child argument is unfair.\n\nSo, the main ethical dilemma here is whether the author should have kept quiet or if he did the right thing by voicing his suspicion. The author's intention was to get Frank to confirm the paternity, which he did. But since he didn't have proof, his suggestion might have been based on a feeling rather than facts. However, Annie had been emotionally cheating, which Frank later admitted to. The author's family is upset because the marriage ended because of the test, which was his suggestion. \n\nMoral responsibility: Did the author overstep by suggesting the test? If Annie was cheating, maybe Frank should have addressed it himself. But the author's concern might have been valid given the suspicion. However, without evidence, bringing it up could be seen as interfering. On the other hand, if the author believed Annie was being dishonest, maybe he had a right to help Frank uncover the truth. \n\nThe author is now being blamed for ruining the marriage. But if the marriage was already built on deceit, maybe the truth coming out was inevitable. The child's paternity is a big deal, so Frank's decision to leave might be justified. The author's family is using the child as a reason to criticize him, but the author argues that Annie was the one who created the situation. \n\nI think this is a nuanced situation. The author acted on a suspicion, which might not be his place to act on, but if the marriage was already in trouble due to infidelity, then the truth might have come out eventually. The author's intention was to support Frank, but the method might have been questionable. However, since Frank ended up taking action based on the suggestion, the author's role is debatable. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, typically, if someone's actions caused a breakup without strong justification, they might be at fault. But here, the author was acting on suspicion, not malicious intent. However, the fact that he didn't have evidence and the marriage ended because of his suggestion could make him partly responsible. On the flip side, if Annie was cheating and hiding it, the author's concern was valid. \n\nConsidering all angles, the author might not be entirely in the wrong because he was trying to help a friend uncover the truth. However, he did overstep by suggesting something that could ruin a marriage without concrete evidence. But given that the infidelity was already happening, maybe the truth was going to come out regardless. So, the answer might be that the author isn't in the wrong (B) because he was acting on his suspicions to support Frank, even if it led to the marriage ending.\n"
