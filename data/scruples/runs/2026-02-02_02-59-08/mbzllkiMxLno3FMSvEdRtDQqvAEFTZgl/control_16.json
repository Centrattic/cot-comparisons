It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for supporting the cheated-on husband, Frank, who discovered his wife Annie was cheating, leading to a paternity issue.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author, who's close to Annie, suspected she was cheating but didn't have proof. After Annie got pregnant and Frank was about to become a father, the author suggested a paternity test during a drunk conversation. The test revealed the child wasn't Frank's. Now, the author is being criticized for ruining the marriage and is isolated socially, while Frank is relocating.\n\nThe key points here are: 1) The author's role in suggesting the test, 2) Whether Annie's actions warranted the outcome, and 3) If the author is at fault for speaking up.\n\nThe author's intent wasn't to cheat but to address a suspicion. Annie had been emotionally unfaithful, which is a form of cheating. The author's suggestion led to Frank taking action, which uncovered the infidelity. However, the author isn't the one who cheated; Annie is. The paternity test was a necessary step for Frank to know the truth. The author's family is blaming them, but the real responsibility lies with Annie for her actions. The author's concern for Frank's well-being seems valid. Even though the author's comment might have been the catalyst, the root cause is Annie's infidelity. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
