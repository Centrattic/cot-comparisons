It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who brought up the paternity test idea (the author) is in the wrong. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author's sister, Annie, married Frank, who works in oil and has a schedule of 14 on, 14 off. The author always felt something was off with Annie's relationship but couldn't do much from afar. Then, when the baby was on the way, the author, after some drinks, suggested a paternity test. Frank took the suggestion seriously, got a test, and it turned out the baby wasn't his. Now, Annie is in a tough spot financially and emotionally, and the author is being blamed by family for breaking up the marriage. The author stands by their belief that Annie was at fault.\n\nSo the main question is whether the author's action was wrong. Let's consider the factors. The author had suspicions but no concrete evidence. They made a suggestion in a casual setting (after drinking), which led to Frank getting a paternity test. The test proved infidelity, but the author's role was just the catalyst. \n\nEthically, is the author responsible? Well, they acted on their suspicions, which were just feelings without proof. They didn't have direct evidence of cheating, just a sense. But by suggesting the test, they might have acted on a hunch that wasn't justified. However, once the test was done and the infidelity was confirmed, the author's initial suspicion was right. But did they overstep by bringing it up?\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, if you have a suspicion about someone's infidelity, it's usually their partner's responsibility to address it. The author isn't Frank's partner, so maybe they shouldn't have intervened. But they were close to both and had a history with Annie since childhood. Their concern might have been genuine, but they crossed a line by making a comment that led to the test. \n\nFrank later decided to pursue the test, so the author's suggestion was just the trigger, not the cause. The real issue is Annie's infidelity. However, the author's action led to the breakdown of the marriage, causing financial and emotional distress. The family is blaming the author for that. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong: The author had a suspicion, but without proof, their suggestion might be seen as meddling. On the other hand, the outcome revealed a truth that Frank needed to know. But the author's role was indirect. Frank had the agency to act on the suggestion. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't entirely at fault. They acted on a hunch, and while it caused consequences, the root problem was Annie's actions. However, the author could have kept their mouth shut, as they weren't in a position to confront or advise without evidence. Therefore, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong for interfering without solid proof, but this is a nuanced situation.\n"
