It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's sister figure, Annie, and her husband Frank. The key points here are the author suggesting a paternity test after suspecting infidelity, which led to Frank finding out the baby wasn't his, resulting in their divorce. The author is now being criticized by their family for ruining the marriage.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's actions. They had a suspicion that Annie was cheating and, after some drinking, mentioned the idea of a paternity test. The author believed Annie was emotionally unfaithful but didn't have concrete proof. By bringing up the paternity test, they inadvertently planted a seed that led Frank to take action. The author's motivation was based on their long-standing relationship with Annie and concern, but their method might be questionable.\n\nNext, the consequences: the marriage ended, Annie lost her financial support and home, and the author is now isolated. The author argues that Annie created the situation, but did they overstep by pushing Frank to get the test? Intervening in someone else's marriage can be complicated. The author might not have had enough evidence to justify their suggestion. However, they did have a feeling something was off, which is subjective. \n\nAnother angle is the emotional cheating part. If Frank had evidence of emotional infidelity, maybe he should have addressed it directly. But the author's role here was to suggest a paternity test, which is a sensitive and definitive action. Even if the author's intention was to protect Frank, the method might have been reckless without more proof.\n\nAlso, the author is being blamed by their family for speaking up. The question is whether the author had the right to interfere. Since they were close to both Frank and Annie, maybe they felt a duty to protect their friend Frank. But relationships are private, and the author might have overstepped by not giving the couple the chance to handle it themselves.\n\nIn terms of accountability, the author might not be entirely at fault because they acted on a suspicion, but they could also be seen as meddlesome. However, Annie's infidelity is the root cause. The author's action was the catalyst, but the responsibility for the marriage's breakdown lies more with Annie. Still, the author's suggestion had real consequences. \n\nI need to weigh the intent versus the outcome. The author's intent was to help Frank, but the outcome was harmful. However, without the author's suggestion, Frank might not have taken the test, so the author's action was a necessary step for Frank to discover the truth. But is it the author's place to push that?\n\nIn many cases, encouraging someone to confront infidelity is a personal matter. The author might not be in the wrong if their intention was to support Frank, but they could have been more cautious. However, since they had a suspicion and acted on it, maybe they did the right thing by ensuring Frank's child is actually his. \n\nOn the other hand, the author could have handled it differently, like talking to Frank privately without implying the test was their idea. The fact that it came out as the author's suggestion might have added pressure. So, while the outcome was negative, the author's role might not be entirely wrong because they were trying to help a friend. \n\nConsidering all this, I think the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong) because the underlying issue was Annie's actions, and the author's intent was to support Frank. However, the way it was handled could have been better, but the author isn't entirely at fault.\n"
