It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author, let's call them \"Charlie,\" is a close friend of Annie, who married Frank. Frank works in the oil industry with a 14-day on, 14-day off schedule. Over three years, Charlie felt something was off, maybe cheating, but couldn't do much from 1000 km away. Then when there's a pregnancy, Charlie, after some beers, suggests a paternity test. Frank later insists on getting one, which reveals the kid isn't his. The test was a result of emotional cheating, not physical. Now Annie is without Frank's income and home, moving back in with her parents. Charlie is being criticized by their family for \"ruining a good marriage\" and using the child as an excuse.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The key points are whether Charlie's suggestion of a paternity test was justified. Cheating is a big deal, but emotional cheating is different. Emotional infidelity might not necessarily mean physical cheating, so maybe Frank jumping to conclusions was wrong. However, if Charlie had a suspicion based on Annie's behavior, maybe they had a reason. But Charlie didn't have proof, just a feeling. The problem is that Charlie's suggestion led Frank to take action that ended the marriage. So is Charlie responsible?\n\nOn one hand, Charlie is supporting Frank, their friend, which is understandable. They might have felt protective of Frank, especially since they were close to Annie. But on the other hand, inserting themselves into the marriage might be overstepping. Frank had the right to make decisions about his marriage, not Charlie. Also, suggesting a paternity test based on a feeling without evidence could be seen as meddling. However, maybe Frank was already considering it, and Charlie just gave him the push he needed. But the fact that Frank later blames the test on Charlie complicates things.\n\nAnnie is left in a bad situation, losing her financial stability and home. The family is criticizing Charlie for ruining the marriage. The argument is that Charlie didn't have the right to interfere. But if Annie was emotionally cheating, maybe Frank was justified in wanting a test. The question is whether Charlie had the right to suggest it. Since Charlie was close to both, they might have felt compelled to act on their suspicions. However, without direct evidence, maybe it's not their place to intervene. \n\nThe \"child card\" argument is tricky. If the child isn't Frank's, then he's not the biological father, so he's not responsible for the child financially. But if he was raising the child as his own, that's a different scenario. However, in this case, the paternity test revealed the truth, which is important for the child's identity and Frank's rights. So maybe Charlie's action was actually helping Frank uncover the truth, which is the right thing to do. \n\nBut the problem is that Charlie's suggestion came after drinking, which might have made Frank take the test prematurely. Also, the fact that Charlie's comment stuck could mean they didn't have a serious conversation about their suspicions. It's possible that Frank and Annie's issues were between them, and Charlie shouldn't have influenced Frank's decision. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, Charlie didn't directly cause the cheating, but they did play a role in Frank learning the truth. However, is it Charlie's fault for supporting Frank's decision to find out the truth? If Annie was indeed cheating, then Frank had the right to know. So maybe Charlie isn't in the wrong for supporting Frank. But if there was no evidence, then maybe it's not their place to meddle. \n\nI'm a bit torn. On one side, the family is saying Charlie ruined the marriage, but if the marriage was already broken due to Annie's infidelity, then maybe the marriage was going to end anyway. The key issue is whether the paternity test was necessary. If the child isn't Frank's, then he's not obligated to support it, so the test was valid. But if the test was based on a suspicion without proof, maybe Frank should have handled it differently. \n\nConsidering all that, I think Charlie isn't entirely in the wrong because they were supporting their friend and had a suspicion. However, the method of suggesting the test in a casual setting (after beers) might not have been the best approach. But ultimately, the responsibility lies with Frank to make decisions about his marriage. So maybe Charlie isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
