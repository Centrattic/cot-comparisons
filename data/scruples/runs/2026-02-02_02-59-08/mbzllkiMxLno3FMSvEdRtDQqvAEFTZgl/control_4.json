It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend's sister, Annie, who married Frank. The author (AITA) supported Frank after he found out Annie was cheating, which led to the discovery that the child isn't his. Now, the author is facing criticism from their family for causing the marriage to fall apart.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author noticed something was off and, after some prompting, suggested a paternity test. Frank took that suggestion seriously, leading to the revelation. The author's family thinks they shouldn't have interfered, but the author believes Annie was at fault. \n\nIs the author at fault? Well, the author didn't know for sure if Annie was cheating; it was a feeling. They made a suggestion in a casual setting (after beers), which Frank then acted on. The author's intention was to confirm the truth, which is understandable. However, the method might be questionable. Suggesting a paternity test without evidence could be seen as intrusive. But the author wasn't the one who initiated the cheating; they were trying to help Frank uncover the truth.\n\nAnnie's actions are clearly wrong for cheating, but the author's role is more about raising a suspicion. The fact that the author's suggestion led to Frank getting a paternity test might be seen as the catalyst, but does that make them wrong? The author didn't have proof, just a feeling. They might have overstepped by bringing up the test, but it's also a way to resolve uncertainty.\n\nThe author's family is criticizing them for ruining the marriage, but Annie was the one who cheated. The author is standing by their belief that Annie is at fault. The isolation from friends and family is a consequence, but the author's actions were based on concern for Frank. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author isn't the one who committed the infidelity. They acted on a suspicion, which turned out to be correct. While the method could be debated, the intent was to help. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong, but maybe they should have handled it more carefully. However, the main fault lies with Annie. Therefore, the answer might be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
