It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for supporting the cheated-on husband by suggesting a paternity test.\n\nFirst, the situation: Frank and Annie are married. Frank is in the oil industry with a work schedule that keeps him away for 14 days. Annie never directly admitted to cheating, but the author (the person narrating) sensed something. After a year, they found out the baby isn't Frank's. The author suggested a paternity test after drinking, which Frank took seriously. Now, Annie is left without Frank's income and home, and the author is being criticized for ruining the marriage.\n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong. Let's consider the elements here. The author's role was to plant the idea of a paternity test, which led to the discovery. But how did they get there? The author had a feeling but no concrete evidence. They brought it up in a casual setting after drinking. Frank then insisted on the test, leading to the breakup. \n\nOn one hand, the author didn't have proof but acted on a suspicion. That could be seen as overstepping, especially since they live far away and aren't directly involved. Suggesting a paternity test without evidence might have been intrusive. On the other hand, if Annie was indeed cheating and the child isn't Frank's, maybe the author's concern was valid, but the way they approached it was inappropriate.\n\nAnnie's actions caused the problem, but the author's suggestion was the catalyst. The author's friends and family blame them for the fallout. The key point is whether the author had the right to intervene. They weren't in a position to know the truth, so acting on a hunch without talking to Frank first might have been meddling. Also, the author's close relationship with Annie might have clouded their judgment.\n\nSo, considering that the author acted on suspicion without evidence and caused a significant disruption, even if their intention was to help, they might be in the wrong. The answer would be A.\n"
