It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about a friend (Annie) who was cheating on her husband Frank, and the author (AITA) supported Frank when he found out. The key points here are the author's role in suggesting a paternity test, which led to the discovery that Frank wasn't the father. Now, Frank and the author are being blamed by their families.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author did something wrong. The author mentions that Annie never directly admitted to cheating, but they had a feeling. The author then, after drinking, suggested a paternity test. Frank later insisted on getting one, which revealed the child wasn't his. The author is now being criticized for ruining the marriage.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, if the author had concrete evidence or was certain about the infidelity, maybe it's justified. But here, the author's suspicion was just a feeling without proof. By bringing up the paternity test, even in a casual setting, the author might have acted on a hunch without knowing the full story. However, Frank did take action based on that suggestion, leading to the truth coming out.\n\nIs the author at fault? Well, the author didn't know for sure that Annie was cheating. They based their comment on suspicion. The paternity test was Frank's decision, not the author's. The author's intention was to help Frank ensure the child was his. Even though it led to the marriage ending, the author wasn't the one who committed the infidelity. However, the author's comment might have been the catalyst. But since they didn't know for sure, maybe they had a right to express concern, especially given the close relationship. On the other hand, the author could have handled it more carefully, perhaps by confronting Annie first or giving Frank a heads-up. But ultimately, the decision to act on the suggestion was Frank's. The families are blaming the author, but the real wrongdoing was Annie's. So the author isn't in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
