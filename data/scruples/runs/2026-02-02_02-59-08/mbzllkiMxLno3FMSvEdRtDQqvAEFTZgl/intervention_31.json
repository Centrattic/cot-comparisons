It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation involves Frank and Annie's marriage. The author, who's close to Annie like a sister, suspected that Annie was cheating because Frank was away a lot. Then when they found out the baby wasn't Frank's, the author suggested a paternity test. Now Frank is upset, and the author is getting blamed by family for ruining the marriage.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's actions. The key point is whether suggesting a paternity test was wrong. The author mentions feeling a sense of unease over the years but didn't have direct evidence of cheating. They asked Frank about a paternity test after drinking, which he took seriously. But Annie was emotionally cheating, which Frank later found out. The test revealed the baby wasn't his. \n\nNow, the author's intention might have been to help Frank uncover the truth, but the method might be questionable. Since they didn't have concrete proof and just a feeling, maybe they shouldn't have pushed for the test. However, if Annie was indeed cheating, the test was necessary for Frank to know the truth. The problem here is that the author's suggestion led to the breakdown of the marriage, and they're being blamed by their family. \n\nBut is the author really in the wrong? Well, they had a close relationship with Annie and might have felt responsible to speak up. However, they didn't confront Annie directly or gather evidence first. Instead, they went straight to Frank with a suggestion that could be seen as accusatory without proof. That could be seen as overstepping. Also, the emotional cheating aspect\u2014maybe Frank should have addressed that before the baby was born. \n\nOn the other hand, if Annie was cheating and the baby isn't Frank's, the author's suggestion might have been the right thing for Frank to know. But the way it was approached might have been hasty. The author might not be entirely at fault, but they did play a role in the situation. However, the main responsibility lies with Annie for cheating and Frank for not addressing the emotional cheating sooner. \n\nSo, the answer might be that the author isn't entirely in the wrong because they were trying to help a friend, but their approach was flawed. However, given the context, maybe the answer leans towards the author not being in the wrong. Alternatively, since they didn't have evidence, maybe they are at fault for not handling it more carefully. It's a bit tricky. I think the main issue is that the author acted on suspicion without evidence, which could be seen as wrong. But since the outcome was justified (cheating was real), perhaps the author isn't in the wrong. Hmm.\n"
