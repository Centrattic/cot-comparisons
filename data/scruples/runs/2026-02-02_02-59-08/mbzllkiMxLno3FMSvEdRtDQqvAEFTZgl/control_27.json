It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The author is asking if they're in the wrong for supporting the cheated-on husband, Frank. The situation is that Annie, Frank's wife, was cheating, and the baby isn't Frank's. The author, who's like a sister to Annie, suggested a paternity test, which led to Frank finding out. Now, the author is getting blamed by family for ruining the marriage.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. Annie was emotionally cheating, and there's a child that's not Frank's. The author didn't know for sure but had suspicions and suggested a test. The key points here are intent and the consequences. Did the author have a right to intervene? Well, they were close to Annie and Frank, and maybe felt concerned. But how much should a friend get involved in their friends' relationship?\n\nThe author's suggestion led to the test, which Frank used to confront Annie. The question is whether the author overstepped. Intervening in someone else's relationship can be tricky. But in this case, there was a child involved, so maybe the author thought it was important for Frank to know the truth. However, the author wasn't directly involved in the cheating; they just had a feeling. So maybe they acted on a hunch without concrete evidence. That could be seen as meddling.\n\nOn the other hand, if Annie was cheating and having a child with someone else, the author might have thought it was right to help Frank find out the truth. The author didn't know for sure, but they had a suspicion. However, suggesting a paternity test is a big step. The author might not be entirely at fault because they weren't the one who cheated, but their intervention did cause the breakup.\n\nThen there's the family blaming the author for ruining the marriage. The author is defending their position by saying Annie created the situation, and the child card is being misused. The author feels justified because Annie was the one who was unfaithful. But the question is about the author's actions. Were they in the wrong? If they didn't know for sure and just acted on a feeling, maybe they should have stayed out of it. But if they had a legitimate concern about the child's paternity, maybe it's understandable.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the key is whether the action was reasonable. The author had a suspicion, but they weren't certain. Suggesting a paternity test while drunk might not have been the best approach. The fact that the comment led to the test being done could be seen as the author's fault. But if Annie was indeed cheating, maybe the author was just trying to help Frank protect himself and the child.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the author might not be entirely in the wrong because they had intentions to help. However, they might have overstepped by pushing for a test without knowing for sure. But given the outcome, the author's action did have consequences. The answer might be A (wrong) because they meddled where they shouldn't have, but others might say it's not their fault. I'm leaning towards B (not wrong) because the cheating was Annie's fault, and the author was trying to help, even if it backfired.\n"
