It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author here is in the wrong. So the situation is that the author, who's friends with Frank and Annie, suspected that Annie was cheating because she's a close friend. Then, during a visit where they were both drunk, the author suggested a paternity test. Frank later took the suggestion seriously and found out the baby wasn't his. Now, Annie is left without Frank's income and home, and the author is being blamed by family and friends.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author didn't have direct evidence of cheating, just a feeling. They were friends since childhood, so maybe they felt close enough to make that comment. But was it right to bring up the paternity test idea while drunk? That might not have been the best approach. However, the author's intention was to help Frank realize the truth, which eventually happened. \n\nBut then, the aftermath: Annie is now in a worse position financially and socially. The author is being criticized for ruining a good marriage. The question is whether the author is at fault. \n\nOn one hand, the author acted on a suspicion without concrete evidence, which could be seen as overstepping. Even if their intention was good, the method of bringing it up while drunk might not have been responsible. On the other hand, if Annie was indeed cheating and emotionally involved with someone else, then the author's comment might have led to Frank uncovering the truth, which is the right thing in the long run. \n\nBut the key point here is that the author didn't have proof. They just had a feeling. Maybe they should have approached it more carefully, or not said anything at all. However, the situation shows that the marriage was already troubled, and the author's comment was a catalyst for Frank to take action. \n\nAlso, considering the emotional cheating part, if Frank found out about that, maybe their marriage was already in trouble. The author's role is tricky because they're a friend, but suggesting a paternity test without evidence could be seen as meddling. However, the alternative is letting a potentially deceptive situation continue. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. But since the author didn't have proof and acted based on a suspicion, even if well-intentioned, some might say they overstepped. But others might argue that they were trying to help a friend. The fact that Annie is now suffering is a consequence, but maybe she's responsible for her own actions. \n\nSo, the decision between A and B. If the answer is A (author is wrong), it's because they acted without proof. If B (not wrong), because they helped uncover the truth. The question is whether the action was in the wrong. The author's action led to the truth coming out, but perhaps they shouldn't have pushed for it without evidence. It's possible the author is in the wrong for interfering in a way that caused harm, even if they meant well. So maybe A is the answer here. But I'm not 100% sure. Another angle is that the author was protecting Frank and helping him see the reality, which is a good deed. But the method was flawed. However, the final answer would depend on whether the action was justified despite the method. Since the author's intention was to help and the outcome was that Frank discovered the infidelity, perhaps the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong. But some might say the method was inappropriate. Hmm. I think the answer is A because making such a suggestion without evidence and under the influence might be crossing a line, even if intentions were good. So the author is in the wrong.\n"
