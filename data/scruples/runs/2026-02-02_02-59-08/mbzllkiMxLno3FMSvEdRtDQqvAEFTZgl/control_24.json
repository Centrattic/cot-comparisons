It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author, let's call them Alex, is a close friend of Annie's. Annie married Frank, who works in the oil industry with a 14 days on, 14 days off schedule. Over three years of marriage, Annie didn't directly say she was cheating, but Alex had a feeling. When Annie got pregnant, Alex, after some drinks, suggested Frank consider a paternity test. Frank took that to heart and got a test, which revealed the baby wasn't his. Now, Annie is left without Frank's income and home, and Alex is being blamed by their family for ruining the marriage. The question is whether Alex is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. Alex suspected infidelity but didn't have proof. They brought up the idea of a paternity test when there was a pregnancy, which led Frank to act on it. The key point here is whether Alex overstepped by suggesting the test. In many cases, suggesting a test can be seen as meddling, especially if there's no concrete evidence. However, since Frank was the one who ultimately decided to do the test, maybe Alex isn't entirely to blame. But the fact that Alex's comment \"stuck\" and led to the test might mean they played a role in the breakdown.\n\nAnother angle is the relationship dynamics. Alex is close to Annie, but Annie was cheating. If Alex knew about the cheating but didn't confront Annie directly, maybe they should have addressed it with her first. Instead, they went to Frank with a suggestion that led to the discovery. That could be seen as interfering in Frank's marriage without his knowledge, which might be crossing a line.\n\nAlso, the aftermath: Annie is now in a tough spot financially, and Alex is being criticized by family. Some might argue that Alex's action, though possibly well-intentioned, caused unnecessary harm. On the other hand, if Annie was indeed cheating, maybe Frank had a right to know, even if it hurt everyone involved.\n\nBut here's a catch: in some jurisdictions, suggesting a paternity test without evidence could be seen as damaging, especially if it's based on suspicion rather than facts. However, Frank chose to act on the suggestion, so the responsibility isn't entirely on Alex. The fact that Frank didn't confront Annie directly but instead took the test after Alex's comment might indicate that Frank had his own suspicions, and Alex's suggestion was the catalyst.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, if Alex didn't have proof but acted on a feeling, that could be seen as meddling. However, if Annie was indeed cheating, maybe Alex was trying to help Frank. The problem is the method\u2014suggesting a test without evidence and without discussing it with Annie first could be problematic.\n\nSo, weighing both sides: Alex's intention might have been to help Frank, but the way they approached it may have been inappropriate. Since they didn't have proof, suggesting a test could be seen as interfering. Therefore, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they meddled in the marriage without concrete evidence. But others might argue that Frank had the right to know, so Alex isn't entirely at fault. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Given that they acted on a suspicion without evidence and caused a breakdown, it's possible they are at least partially in the wrong. So leaning towards A.\n"
