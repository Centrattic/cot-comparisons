It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for supporting the husband who was cheated on. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the story involves Frank and Annie. The author is close to Annie, almost like a sister. Frank is in the oil industry with a 14-day on/off schedule. Over three years, Annie didn't explicitly say she was cheating, but the author had a feeling. Then, when the baby comes, the author, after drinking, suggests a paternity test. Frank takes the suggestion seriously, does the test, finds out the kid isn't his. The author's comment led to this, which caused the marriage to fall apart. Now Annie is left without Frank's income and home, moving back with her parents. The author is getting flak from family for ruining the marriage, and both are isolated.\n\nThe author defends their stance, saying Annie created the situation and that using the child as an excuse is unfair. Now, the question is whether the author is wrong.\n\nHmm. So, the key points here are: Did the author have a right to bring up the paternity test? Was it their place? Let's think. The author noticed something and felt concerned. But since they live far away, maybe they didn't have enough evidence. By suggesting the test, they might have acted on suspicion without proof, which led to Frank confronting Annie. The problem is that the author's action caused the marriage to end, even if Annie was cheating.\n\nBut wait, if Annie was indeed emotionally cheating and the child isn't Frank's, then maybe the marriage was already in trouble. However, the author's role here is complicated. They weren't a direct party, just a friend. But their suggestion led to the paternity test, which exposed the infidelity. The question is if the author overstepped by making that suggestion, especially while drunk.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, if the author had concrete evidence, maybe they could have done something. But they just had a feeling. Acting on suspicion without proof might be crossing a line. Even if Annie was cheating, the author's intervention might have been misguided. They could have advised Frank to address the issue without a test, but instead, they suggested something that would irreversibly damage the marriage.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author was trying to help Frank by pointing out the possibility. But the issue is that it's not their place to decide that. The author might have thought they were helping, but without being asked, their intervention could be seen as meddling. The fact that the author is now isolated suggests that their actions had a significant negative impact, even if their intentions were good.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author might be in the wrong because they acted on a suspicion without evidence and without being directly asked, leading to the breakdown of the marriage. Even if Annie was at fault, the author's method of handling it was inappropriate. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
