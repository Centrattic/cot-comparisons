It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The scenario is about a friend, Annie, who they've known since they were babies. Her husband, Frank, works in the oil industry with a 14-day on, 14-day off schedule. The writer noticed that Annie might be cheating but couldn't be sure because they live far away. Then when Annie gets pregnant, the writer suggests a paternity test, which leads to Frank finding out the kid isn't his.\n\nThe writer is being blamed by their family for ruining the marriage, but they think Annie is to blame for cheating. The question is whether the writer is in the wrong.\n\nSo, first, did the writer have a right to suggest the paternity test? Well, they were concerned but couldn't provide evidence. The test was the result of a suggestion made after drinking, which might not have been the best time. But the writer's intention was to help Frank confirm the child's paternity, which is a valid concern if there's suspicion. However, the way it came about was through a comment after drinking, which might have been insensitive. Also, the writer didn't have concrete evidence, just a feeling based on proximity to Annie and Frank's situation.\n\nAnnie's situation is that she's part-time and now without Frank's income and a home. The writer's family is upset because they think the writer shouldn't have said anything. Frank is now isolated and moving away. The writer feels Annie created the situation by cheating. \n\nBut the key point is whether the writer acted in a way that's justifiable. If they had no proof, even if they suspected, bringing up the paternity test might have forced Frank to confront the issue, which could have been a good thing if the suspicions were true. On the other hand, if there was no evidence, maybe the writer overstepped. Also, the comment was made after drinking, which might have been less responsible. \n\nThe writer's role as a friend to both Annie and Frank complicates things. They might have felt conflicted but chose to support Frank, leading to the breakdown of the marriage. The writer's suggestion led to the paternity test, which resulted in the marriage ending. So, even if Annie was cheating, the writer's intervention was a catalyst. But did they have a right to intervene without more evidence? Maybe not. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, if the writer didn't have proof, they might have acted recklessly. However, if they genuinely believed something was wrong and tried to help Frank confirm it, perhaps they're not entirely at fault. But the method (suggestion after drinking) might have been hasty. Also, the aftermath suggests that the writer's actions caused a rift, so they might be seen as overstepping their bounds as a friend.\n\nConsidering all this, the answer could be A (the writer is in the wrong) because they acted on suspicion without evidence, leading to the marriage's collapse. But if the suspicion was valid, maybe they're in the right. However, the way they handled it (after drinking, no evidence) makes their role questionable. So probably A.\n"
