It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the AITA post) is in the wrong.\n\nSo, the situation is that the author is supporting Frank, who was cheated on by his wife Annie. The key points here are: Frank and Annie had a marriage where Annie was emotionally cheating. The author, who is close to both (like a sibling), suggested a paternity test after some alcohol, which led to Frank finding out the baby isn't his. Now, Annie is in a bad spot financially and has to move back in with her parents. The author is being blamed by their family for ruining the marriage, and they feel they're standing by Frank who's being isolated.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's actions. They noticed something was off, maybe for years, but didn't confront Annie directly. Instead, they casually suggested a paternity test to Frank after drinking. This suggestion, even if made in a moment of lowered inhibitions, led to Frank getting a test. The test confirmed his suspicions, leading to the breakdown of the marriage.\n\nWas the author wrong to bring up the idea? Well, Frank and Annie were married for three years, and Annie was emotionally unfaithful. The author had a close relationship with both. The paternity test was a direct consequence of the author's suggestion, but Frank took the initiative to push for it. The author didn't force him; he acted on the suggestion. So maybe the author isn't entirely at fault here. However, suggesting a paternity test without concrete evidence could be seen as a big step, even if the intuition was correct.\n\nThe author's family is blaming them for the breakup. But the author's intention was to help Frank discover the truth. If the marriage was already being harmed by Annie's infidelity, then uncovering the paternity might be a necessary step. However, the author's role in pushing for the test could be seen as overstepping if there wasn't clear evidence. On the other hand, the author might have been acting on valid concerns and a close relationship with Frank.\n\nThe child's situation is being used against the author. But Annie's infidelity led to the child not being Frank's, so the author's suggestion led to the truth coming out. The author argues that Annie created the situation, which is true. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong for causing the marriage to end. However, the marriage was already broken due to Annie's actions. The author facilitated the discovery of the truth, which led to the separation, which could be seen as the right thing to do.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author isn't the one who cheated. The author tried to help Frank uncover the truth. While the method might have been questionable (suggesting a paternity test after drinking), the outcome was the truth coming to light. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The blame might be misplaced because the root issue was Annie's infidelity. The author's family is upset, but that's their reaction, not necessarily the author's fault.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
