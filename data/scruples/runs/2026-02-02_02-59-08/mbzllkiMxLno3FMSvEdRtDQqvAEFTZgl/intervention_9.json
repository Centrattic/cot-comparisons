It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is complicated, so I need to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the author is close to Annie, who is their sister-like figure. Annie married Frank, who works in the oil industry with a 14-day on, 14-day off schedule. The author noticed that Annie might have been emotionally cheating or at least there were suspicions. Then, when there was a pregnancy, the author suggested a paternity test during a conversation after drinking. Frank took that suggestion seriously and got a test, which confirmed the baby wasn't his. The author's suggestion led to the marriage breaking down, and now Frank is upset, and the author is being criticized by their family.\n\nSo the main question is whether the author overstepped by suggesting the paternity test. Let's consider the points:\n\n1. Did the author have a right to intervene? The author had a feeling that Annie was cheating but didn't have direct evidence. They were close to Annie, so maybe they felt protective. However, suggesting a paternity test is a serious step that can destroy a marriage. The author might have thought they were helping Frank, but it's possible they didn't realize the consequences.\n\n2. The author's suggestion came after drinking, which might have clouded their judgment. Even so, the comment stuck and led to Frank taking action. The author might not have intended for the test to happen, but they did plant the idea. That's a bit of a problem because they might be responsible for the fallout, even if indirectly.\n\n3. Annie was emotionally cheating, and the author might have believed she was being dishonest. But the author didn't have proof beyond their suspicions. By suggesting the test, they might have acted on their feelings without confirming the facts. That could be seen as meddling.\n\n4. The author is now being blamed for ruining the marriage. The family thinks they should have stayed silent. There's a conflict between protecting a friend (Annie) and standing up for the truth. The author's actions caused significant harm, even if their intention was to help Frank.\n\n5. The author argues that Annie created the situation, but the question is whether the author's role in revealing the truth makes them at fault. In some ethical views, if someone is unfaithful, the truth should come out, but the method of revealing it matters. The author's method was indirect and possibly unnecessary.\n\n6. Frank might have suspected something and the author's comment pushed him over the edge. Without the suggestion, maybe Frank would have stayed in the marriage, unaware or choosing to ignore the infidelity. The author's intervention led to immediate consequences, so they share some responsibility.\n\nConsidering all these points, the author's intention was to help Frank, but their method was questionable. They acted on suspicions without evidence and in a way that directly caused the marriage to end. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because they interfered in a personal matter without certainty and caused harm. However, there's an argument that Annie was at fault for cheating, so the author's action was a response to that. But the key issue is whether the author's suggestion was the right approach. Given that they didn't have direct evidence and acted in a way that led to public fallout, it's more likely that the author is at least partially at fault. So the answer would be A for yes.\n"
