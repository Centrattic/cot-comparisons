It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about Frank and Annie's marriage. The author is a close friend of Annie, who is also like a sister. Frank works in the oil industry with a 14-day on and off schedule. The author felt that Annie might be cheating, but there was no direct evidence. The author had a feeling the baby wasn't Frank's and suggested a paternity test after drinking. Frank took the suggestion seriously, did the test, and found out the baby wasn't his. Now the author is getting blamed by their family for ruining the marriage and causing Frank and Annie to split. The author is defending themselves, saying Annie was at fault and using the child as an excuse is unfair.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author had the right to question Frank about the paternity. The author didn't have concrete evidence, just a feeling. The article says that the author's comment stuck with Frank, leading him to get a test. So the author's suggestion, even if it was a joke or offhand, ended up causing the breakup. The key points here are intent and the impact of the suggestion.\n\nThe author's intention might have been to help Frank, thinking he was being cheated on. But without any evidence, it's a big accusation. Even if the author believed Annie was unfaithful, bringing up the paternity test idea without proof could be seen as interfering. The author's role as a friend to both Frank and Annie complicates things. They might have thought they were helping, but their words had real consequences.\n\nOn the other hand, Annie was emotionally cheating, which Frank later discovered. If the author had good reason to suspect something, maybe their concern was valid. But the story says Annie never directly admitted to cheating; it was just a feeling. The author's suggestion led to the test, which exposed the infidelity, but the method of how the author approached it might be problematic.\n\nAlso, the author is being blamed by their family for causing the breakdown. The question is whether they crossed a line by suggesting the test. Since the author didn't have proof, their suggestion could be seen as an overreach, especially if it wasn't their place to question Annie's fidelity. Frank might have been in denial or didn't want to confront Annie directly, and the author's comment pushed him into action.\n\nAnother angle: the author was a close friend, so maybe they thought they were helping. However, suggesting a paternity test based on a hunch is a serious accusation. It's possible that the author didn't consider the consequences, and their action led to the divorce and Frank's financial instability. But the root cause was Annie's infidelity, so maybe the author isn't entirely at fault. However, their role in pushing for the test could make them partially responsible.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author might be in the wrong because they acted on a suspicion without evidence, leading to the breakup. Even if Annie was cheating, the author's method of intervention was inappropriate. Therefore, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong). But I'm not 100% sure. Maybe the answer is B if we consider that the author was trying to help and the real fault lies with Annie. But the question is about the author's actions. Hmm.\n"
