It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by reading the situation carefully.\n\nThe story is about the author, who is friends with Annie and Frank. They've known each other since they were babies. The author considers Annie more of a sister. Frank works in the oil industry with a 14-day on/off schedule. Over three years of marriage, Annie never directly admitted to cheating, but the author had a feeling. When the couple announced a baby, the author, during a visit and after some beers, suggested Frank consider a paternity test. The comment stuck, and Frank insisted on a test, which revealed he wasn't the father. The author is now getting criticized for causing the breakdown of the marriage and being an isolated person. The author believes Annie was the one at fault and feels it's unfair to blame them. Frank is moving to the author's city to get away from the situation.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author's actions were wrong. The key points here are the author's suggestion of a paternity test. The author mentions that they noticed something was off but didn't have direct evidence. They made the comment during a casual conversation after drinking, which might have been a slip of the tongue. However, this led to Frank taking the suggestion seriously, leading to the paternity test and the subsequent fallout.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics here. The author is a close friend, like a sister, to Annie. They might have felt concern for Frank, given their history. But is it the author's place to bring up such a sensitive topic? If there were no concrete suspicions, just a feeling, maybe the author overstepped. However, the author might have thought they were helping Frank avoid being a father to someone else's child.\n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't know for sure that Annie was cheating. They based their comment on a feeling. The article's title is \"Am I the Asshole,\" so the author is questioning their own actions. The family is criticizing them for ruining the marriage, but the author believes Annie was the one who created the situation. The author is defending their stance, thinking that Annie's infidelity is the root of the problem.\n\nBut the author's role here is tricky. They might have acted out of concern, but without evidence, suggesting a paternity test is a serious accusation. It's possible that the author didn't have the right to raise this with Frank unless there was clear evidence. Even though they were close to Annie, inserting themselves into the relationship could be seen as crossing a line.\n\nHowever, sometimes friends do step in when they suspect something's wrong, even if they're not sure. The question is whether the author had the right to make that suggestion. If the author genuinely believed there was a possibility of infidelity and was trying to protect Frank, maybe they weren't entirely wrong. But it's also possible that the author's suggestion was based on a hunch and not actual proof, which led to unnecessary damage.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, the author's intention was to help Frank, but the outcome was harmful. The line between being a concerned friend and overstepping can be thin. The fact that the author is now being blamed by their own family complicates things. The author's family thinks they shouldn't have said anything, which is a common perspective\u2014people often think that staying out of others' business is the safest route.\n\nHowever, the root of the problem is Annie's infidelity. The author's comment was the catalyst for the paternity test, but the real issue is Annie's actions. So perhaps the author isn't entirely to blame, as they were highlighting a potential problem that was already there. But without evidence, making such a suggestion could be seen as meddling.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author might not be entirely at fault because the infidelity was Annie's doing, their role in bringing up the paternity test without concrete evidence could be considered crossing a boundary. However, depending on the context, some might argue that the author was trying to help. It's a nuanced situation where both sides have points.\n"
