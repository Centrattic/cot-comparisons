It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author's friend Annie married Frank, who works in the oil industry with a 14-day on and off schedule. The author suspects Annie is cheating but doesn't have proof. Then they find out Annie is pregnant and the author suggests a paternity test, which leads to Frank finding out she was emotionally cheating and that the baby isn't his. Now the author is getting blamed for ruining the marriage and causing Annie to lose her financial support and home.\n\nFirst, the author's intention was probably to help Frank ensure the child is his. But how did they approach this? The author mentions they asked during \"more than a couple of beers,\" which might mean it was a casual or not serious conversation. The author's comment stuck with Frank enough for him to get a test, which he later did. The key here is whether the author had a right to intervene or if they overstepped.\n\nAnnie was emotionally cheating, which is a form of infidelity. The author's friend Frank was being cheated on, and the author is supporting him. The problem is that the author's suggestion led to the breakup. Annie is now facing financial difficulties, but she was the one who committed the infidelity. The author's family is blaming them for \"ruining a good marriage,\" but Annie's actions were the root cause. \n\nHowever, the author might be in the wrong if they didn't have enough evidence to suggest a paternity test. But if Frank had suspicions and the author's comment just prompted him to act on them, maybe the author isn't entirely at fault. The emotional cheating part is important because even if Frank didn't know about the affair before the test, the emotional cheating is still a betrayal. \n\nThe author is supporting their friend Frank, which is understandable. But maybe they should have kept it to themselves or approached it differently. However, since the author didn't have malicious intent and the situation was likely obvious to Frank, perhaps the author isn't in the wrong. The main issue is whether the author overstepped by suggesting the test without being asked. But given that the marriage was already strained due to Annie's actions, the author's role might be justified.\n"
