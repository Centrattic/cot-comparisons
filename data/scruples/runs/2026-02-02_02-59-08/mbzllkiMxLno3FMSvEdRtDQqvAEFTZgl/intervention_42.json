It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who suggested a paternity test is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend (Annie) who they suspect is cheating, and after the test confirms the baby isn't Frank's, the family and friends are upset with the author for causing the breakup.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author has known Annie since childhood and has a close relationship. They noticed something off and, after some alcohol, suggested a paternity test. Frank later acted on that suggestion, leading to the discovery. Now, the author is facing criticism for ruining the marriage, and they're standing by their decision.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the author's intention was to help Frank uncover the truth. However, they didn't have concrete evidence, just a feeling. Introducing the idea of a paternity test might have been a sensitive topic, especially without direct proof. Even though the author was close to both, suggesting such a thing could be seen as overstepping, especially if it wasn't Annie's intention to share that information. The author's action led to the breakup, which caused significant life changes for both Frank and Annie.\n\nOn the other hand, if Annie was indeed cheating, the author's suggestion helped Frank discover the truth. But the author might not have the right to push for a test based on suspicion alone. The method of bringing it up (after drinking) could have been inappropriate. Also, the fallout affects not just the couple but their extended family, and the author's role in that is controversial.\n\nThe key points are: the author acted on suspicion without evidence, potentially causing harm, and now the community is blaming them. Whether it's right or wrong depends on the balance between helping a friend uncover infidelity versus respecting marriage boundaries. In many cases, people might argue that the author intervened without the right to do so, making them at fault. So, answer A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) seems appropriate.\n"
