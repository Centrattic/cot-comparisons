It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The situation involves Frank and Annie, where the author (let's call them \"the narrator\") is a close friend of both. The narrator has known Annie since they were babies, and Annie married Frank.\n\nSo, the key points here: Frank is in the oil industry with a work schedule of 14 days on, 14 days off. Over three years of marriage, Annie never openly admitted to cheating, but the narrator had suspicions. The big moment comes when Annie is pregnant, and the narrator, after some drinks, suggests to Frank that maybe a paternity test is a good idea. Frank takes that idea seriously, gets the test done, and finds out the baby isn't his. The marriage falls apart, and the narrator is getting criticized for causing the breakdown.\n\nNow, the question is whether the narrator is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The narrator's intention was to help Frank by pointing out a possible issue based on their suspicions. However, they didn't have concrete evidence, just a \"feeling.\" The problem is that the suggestion led to the paternity test, which exposed the infidelity. But since the narrator was close to both Frank and Annie, maybe they thought they were doing the right thing.\n\nBut was it the narrator's place to make that suggestion? Even if they had suspicions, bringing it up, especially after drinking, might be seen as crossing a boundary. Frank might not have considered the paternity test otherwise. The narrator's concern was for their friend Frank, but their action caused significant harm. On the other hand, Frank did make the decision to get the test, so maybe the responsibility isn't entirely on the narrator. \n\nAlso, the fact that Annie was emotionally cheating (and possibly physically) is a key factor. If Annie was the one who was unfaithful, then the narrator's action actually uncovered the truth, which could be seen as the right thing to do. However, the way it was done\u2014without evidence and based on a hunch\u2014might be problematic. The narrator might have overstepped by suggesting something so drastic.\n\nBut the aftermath shows that the marriage ended, which was inevitable because of Annie's actions. The narrator is being blamed for causing the break-up, but maybe the real fault lies with Annie for cheating. The narrator is caught in the middle, but their suggestion was the catalyst. However, if Frank was already suspicious, the narrator's suggestion just pushed him to act on it. \n\nIn terms of the question, the answer hinges on whether the narrator's action was justified. Since they were acting on a suspicion without proof, it's a gray area. Some might say they were trying to help, others might say they shouldn't have meddled. But given that the marriage was already troubled due to Annie's infidelity, the narrator's role might not be entirely at fault. However, the fact that they made the suggestion without knowing the full story could make them \"AITA\" because they caused the breakup based on a hunch. \n\nStill, considering the outcome, if Annie was indeed cheating, maybe the narrator did the right thing. But the method of bringing it up and the lack of evidence might mean they are partly to blame. The answer might depend on cultural or personal ethics. In some views, friends have a duty to protect each other, so the narrator's action is justified. Others might say that it's none of their business and they should have stayed out of it. \n\nConsidering all that, the answer could be either A or B. But the key is whether the narrator is in the wrong. If the narrator's intention was good, but the method was flawed, maybe they're not in the wrong. However, if the action caused unnecessary harm, they could be. Since the story ends with Frank and the narrator being isolated, and the narrator defending their position, it's possible that the community might side with them because they were protecting their friend. But others might think they shouldn't have intervened without proof. \n\nI think the answer here is B (No), because the narrator's action, while perhaps impulsive, was based on concern for a friend and led to exposing the truth. The main fault lies with Annie for cheating. The narrator isn't entirely to blame. However, there's a strong argument for A because they caused the breakup by suggesting the test without evidence. But given the context, B seems more likely.\n"
