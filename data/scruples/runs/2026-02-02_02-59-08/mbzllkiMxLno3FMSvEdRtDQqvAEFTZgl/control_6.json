It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for supporting the husband who was cheated on. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author's sister (Annie) married Frank, who works in the oil industry with a 14-day on/off schedule. The author had a suspicion that Annie was cheating but didn't have proof. The key moment is when the author, during a visit with a lot of alcohol, suggested a paternity test. This led Frank to push for one, which revealed the baby wasn't his. Now the author is getting blamed by family for ruining the marriage, and both the author and Frank are isolated.\n\nThe author's defense is that Annie created the situation by cheating (emotional and actual), and they think pointing out the child's paternity isn't fair. So, the question is, is the author wrong for supporting Frank's decision to get the test?\n\nI need to consider the ethical angles here. The author's intention might have been to help Frank uncover the truth, which is understandable if they believed Annie was unfaithful. However, bringing up the paternity test in a casual, drunken setting might not have been the best approach. But does that make the author at fault? \n\nOn one hand, the author might have overstepped by suggesting something so serious without knowing for sure. On the other hand, if Annie was indeed cheating and having a child with another man, the truth would come out eventually. The author's intention was to protect Frank from being a father to someone else's child, which is a valid concern. However, the method of bringing it up might have caused unnecessary harm, especially if the suggestion was made in a way that pushed Frank to act without considering the consequences.\n\nAlso, the author's family is criticizing them for \"ruining a good marriage,\" which is a common knee-jerk reaction. But Annie was the one who committed the infidelity, so maybe the author isn't entirely at fault. The author's support for Frank is based on his right to know the truth about his paternity.\n\nAnother point: the author didn't have direct proof of cheating, just a feeling. Acting on a suspicion without evidence could be seen as problematic. However, if the suspicion was based on prior behavior, maybe the author had some reason to be concerned. But the author isn't in a position to make Frank act on that suspicion.\n\nIn terms of consequences, the marriage broke down, Annie is now struggling financially and living with her parents, and both the author and Frank are isolated. The author's role in this is the suggestion that led to the paternity test. But if Frank was already considering it, maybe the author's comment just accelerated the process. Alternatively, the author might have planted a seed of doubt that Frank didn't have before.\n\nLegal and ethical standards usually protect someone's right to know the paternity of their child. So if the author helped Frank discover that, it's a positive outcome. But the way it was brought up could be seen as intrusive. However, the author was acting out of concern for a friend, which is a common justification.\n\nIn summary, while the author's actions might have been well-intentioned, the method of suggesting a paternity test without concrete evidence could be seen as overstepping. However, given that Annie was cheating, the author isn't entirely at fault. It's a gray area. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the author had no malicious intent and was trying to help, maybe they aren't wrong. Alternatively, if they acted recklessly, maybe they are. The answer might depend on cultural perspectives on such matters.\n"
