It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author (let's call them Alex) has a close friend Annie, who's married to Frank. Frank is in the oil industry with a 14 on, 14 off schedule. For three years, Annie never directly told anyone she was cheating, but Alex had a feeling. Then when Annie and Frank announce a baby, Alex, after some drinking, suggests a paternity test. Frank takes it seriously, does the test, finds out the kid isn't his. Now Annie is left without Frank's income and home, moving back with her parents. Alex is getting criticized by their family for ruining the marriage and being out of line. The question is whether Alex is in the wrong for suggesting the paternity test.\n\nFirst, let's consider what Alex did. They were concerned about Annie's possible infidelity but didn't have concrete evidence. They brought up the idea of a paternity test in a social setting after drinking. The key here is whether Alex overstepped by making that suggestion. Since Annie never admitted to cheating, Alex was acting on suspicion. But in doing so, they might have caused Frank to take action that led to the breakup.\n\nNow, the possible angles: On one hand, Alex's concern might be justified if there were signs of infidelity. But on the other hand, without direct evidence, suggesting a paternity test could be seen as intrusive. The problem is that Frank acted on that suggestion, which resulted in the discovery of the cheating. But was Alex responsible for Frank's decision? Maybe not entirely, but the suggestion did play a role.\n\nAlso, the aftermath: Annie is now in a difficult position financially and socially. The family is blaming Alex for ruining the marriage. But was Annie at fault? If she was indeed cheating, then maybe Frank was justified in wanting to leave. However, the child is involved, and pulling the \"child\" card complicates things. But the author argues that Annie created the situation, so the child card is being misused.\n\nThe question is about whether Alex is in the wrong. The main issue is whether they had the right to suggest the paternity test. If Alex had no evidence, just a feeling, maybe they shouldn't have brought it up. But they were close to both Frank and Annie, so perhaps they felt responsible to act on their suspicions. However, in relationships, unless there's clear evidence, suggesting such a thing can be damaging. So maybe Alex did overstep, making them at least partially responsible.\n\nAnother angle: Frank might have eventually discovered the infidelity on his own, but Alex's comment accelerated the process. But is that the author's fault? Or is Frank responsible for not noticing? The line between helping a friend and interfering is blurry here.\n\nIn terms of social norms, friends might have a responsibility to look out for each other. But when it comes to personal relationships, unless there's clear evidence, it's often advised not to interfere. So Alex might have crossed a line by making that suggestion without being certain. However, if Annie was indeed cheating, maybe the author was trying to prevent a bigger problem down the line.\n\nBut in the end, the author's action led to the breakup, and Annie is now in a worse position. The family blames the author for meddling. The author defends themselves by saying Annie created the situation, but the act of suggesting the test was what triggered the events. So the question is whether that suggestion was an overreach.\n\nI think there's a case to be made that Alex was in the wrong for interfering without sufficient evidence. However, if Annie was indeed cheating, maybe the author was trying to help. But since the situation ended up causing so much damage, it's a gray area. But given the information, since Annie didn't confirm cheating and Alex acted on suspicion, the author might be in the wrong. So answer A (Yes).\n"
