It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author, let's call them Alex for clarity, is friends with Annie and Frank. Annie and Frank were married, and Alex suggested Frank consider a paternity test, which led to Frank finding out Annie had cheated. Now, Annie is without Frank's income and a home, and both Alex and Frank are being shunned by their families and friends.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. Alex didn't know for sure that Annie had cheated; they just had a feeling. Alex's suggestion was made after a few beers, which might have been a bit off the cuff. But the suggestion stuck, leading Frank to get a paternity test. The test confirmed the baby wasn't his. Now, people are blaming Alex for ruining the marriage.\n\nThe main question is whether Alex is in the wrong. From a moral standpoint, cheating is wrong, so Annie is clearly at fault. However, Alex's role in bringing this to light is the point of contention. Was it right for Alex to bring up the paternity test idea, even if they were just a friend?\n\nOn one hand, Alex might have been trying to help Frank by pointing out a suspicion. Since Frank was away a lot, maybe Annie had the opportunity. But on the other hand, Alex had no concrete evidence. They just had a feeling. Intervening in someone's marriage without evidence can be seen as overstepping. Also, the suggestion was made in a casual setting (after drinking), which might not have been the best approach.\n\nThen there's the aftermath. Frank and Annie's marriage fell apart, and now Annie is in a difficult financial situation. The family is blaming Alex for this. The argument here is whether Alex's action was the cause of the breakup. However, the underlying issue was Annie's infidelity. If Frank hadn't acted on Alex's suggestion, the truth might have come out later in another way. So maybe Alex accelerated the inevitable.\n\nBut was it Alex's place to intervene? If Annie had been unfaithful, she was the one at fault. The author's intention was to help a friend, but without knowing the full story. If the suggestion led to the breakup, then Alex might feel responsible. However, it's possible that Frank was already aware of the cheating but in denial, and the test was just the confirmation he needed.\n\nAnother angle: the child. Annie is now a single parent without financial support. Is it fair to blame Alex for the child's situation? If Annie was cheating, maybe she's the one responsible for the consequences. But the child isn't at fault. However, the author's action led to the revelation, which caused the family to break up. So there's an argument that the author's action, while well-intentioned, had negative repercussions.\n\nBut does that make the author wrong? Or is it just a tragic consequence of a cheating spouse? If the author didn't have concrete evidence, maybe they shouldn't have made the suggestion. But if they had a strong suspicion based on knowing Annie well, maybe it was a compassionate act to help Frank.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the person who committed the infidelity is the one at fault. The author's action was a catalyst, but not the root cause. So maybe the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong because the real issue was Annie's cheating. However, some might argue that the author overstepped by bringing up the paternity test without evidence. But given the situation, if the intention was to help a friend, maybe it's justifiable.\n\nI think the key here is that the author acted out of concern for their friend, even if it led to a difficult outcome. The real wrongdoing was Annie's infidelity. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
