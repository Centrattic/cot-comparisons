It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about Frank and Annie's marriage. The author, who's close to Annie like a sister, suspected that Annie was cheating because Frank was often away for work. The author then, after some drinking, suggested a paternity test, which led Frank to get one, and it turned out the baby wasn't his. Now, Annie is in a tough spot financially and emotionally, and the author is being blamed by their family for ruining the marriage.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's intentions. The author felt a \"feeling they couldn't shake\" and decided to bring it up. But was that the right approach? They were 1000 km away, so maybe they weren't in a position to intervene directly. However, suggesting a paternity test is a big deal. Even if it was a suggestion during drinking, if the author knew about the potential consequences, maybe they should have handled it differently. \n\nThen there's the aspect of trust. Frank and Annie's marriage had issues, but was the author overstepping by pushing Frank to get a paternity test? If Annie was cheating, maybe Frank had a right to know, but the author's role here is complicated because they were close to Annie. Were they trying to protect Frank, or were they acting out of their own suspicions without concrete evidence?\n\nAlso, the aftermath: Annie is now in a difficult situation, losing her home and income. The author's family is blaming them, saying they should have kept quiet. The author argues that Annie was the one who created the situation, but is that a valid defense? The author's action (or suggestion) led directly to the paternity test, which caused the breakup. Even if Annie was at fault, the author's role in exposing the infidelity might be seen as the catalyst.\n\nAnother angle: the author mentions they thought of the child. But the paternity test revealed the child wasn't Frank's, so maybe the author believed Frank had a right to know. However, the way they approached it\u2014during a drinking session\u2014could be seen as careless. Maybe they should have discussed it more seriously or supported Frank in a different way.\n\nAlso, the isolation from friends and family suggests that the community is taking sides, but the author's responsibility here is questionable. Were they justified in interfering, or did they overstep their bounds as a friend of Annie's?\n\nIn summary, the author might be in the wrong because they acted on suspicions without certainty and their interference directly caused the breakdown of the marriage. However, if Annie was indeed cheating, maybe Frank had a right to know. But the author's method of bringing it up was perhaps inappropriate, and they might have known that suggesting a paternity test could lead to such consequences. So, perhaps the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because their suggestion, even if well-intentioned, was a direct cause of the marital breakdown and they didn't consider the repercussions properly.\n"
