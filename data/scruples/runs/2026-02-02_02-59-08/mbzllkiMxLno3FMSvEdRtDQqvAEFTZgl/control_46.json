It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the AITA post) is in the wrong. The situation involves Frank and Annie, where Frank found out his wife was cheating, leading to a breakup. The author is a close friend to both, and they suggested a paternity test which led to the discovery.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author has known Annie since childhood, is like a sister. Frank is in the oil industry with a 14-day on/off schedule. The author suspected Annie was cheating but didn't have direct evidence. When Frank found out about the baby, the author's suggestion of a paternity test led him to confirm the infidelity. Now Frank is estranged from his family, the author is getting blamed, and they're both isolated.\n\nThe main question is whether the author is at fault. The user wants an answer A or B. So, I need to evaluate if the author did something wrong here.\n\nFirst, the author's role. They made a suggestion to Frank about a paternity test. But they were concerned because they had a feeling Annie was cheating. The author wasn't directly accusing but planting a seed. However, the user is getting blamed by their family for \"ruining the marriage.\" \n\nSo, did the author have the right to suggest the test? Well, the author's intent might have been to help Frank. However, the method might be questionable. Since the author didn't have concrete evidence, just a feeling, suggesting the test might have been intrusive. Even if the author thought they were helping, maybe they overstepped. \n\nBut on the other hand, Annie was cheating, and the author had a close relationship with both. The author might have felt compelled to protect Frank, especially since they knew Annie since childhood. But does that justify the action? It's a gray area. \n\nThe fact that the author's family is blaming them for ruining the marriage is another angle. The author wasn't part of the marriage, so perhaps they shouldn't be blamed for the consequences. However, their suggestion directly led to the test. But if the marriage was already on shaky ground (due to the cheating), maybe the test was inevitable. \n\nAnother point is the child's involvement. The parents are using the child as a reason to defend Annie. The author is defending by saying Annie created the situation. But the child is innocent. However, the author's role isn't directly harming the child; they're just part of the chain that led to the discovery. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the focus is often on intent and social norms. The author had intentions to protect a friend, but maybe acted out of overstepping boundaries. The author didn't have the right to interfere in Frank's marriage unless there was explicit consent. The suggestion of a paternity test is a serious step that can ruin a marriage. Even if the author felt it was necessary, the method might be inappropriate. \n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong for suggesting the test based on a feeling, without evidence. However, the cheating was real, so maybe the marriage was doomed. The author's family is being harsh, but the author's action had real consequences. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer could be A (yes) because they meddled without evidence, leading to the breakup. Alternatively, B (no) because they were trying to help a friend. \n\nI think the key here is that the author acted out of concern but overstepped. They didn't have clear evidence, just a feeling. Suggesting a paternity test is a massive intervention. Even though the outcome was bad, the author's intent was good. However, in terms of responsibility, their action caused the marriage to end. \n\nIn AITA cases, if your interference leads to a breakup, you might be considered at fault even if you had good intentions. So, the answer could be A. But then again, if the marriage was already in trouble, maybe not. \n\nAlternatively, the author isn't responsible for the marriage's outcome because it's Frank and Annie's responsibility. But the author's suggestion was the catalyst. \n\nHmm. It's a tough call. But considering the lack of evidence and the personal nature of the interference, the author might be at fault. So answer A.\n"
