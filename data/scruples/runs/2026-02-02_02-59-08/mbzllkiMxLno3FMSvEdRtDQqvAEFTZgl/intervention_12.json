It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves their sister's friend, Annie, who was cheating on her husband Frank. The author suggested a paternity test, which led to the discovery that the child wasn't Frank's. Now, Frank and the author are being shunned by their families, and the author is getting blamed for ruining the marriage.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the roles here. The author is a close friend, almost like a sister, to Annie. They had a feeling Annie was cheating but didn't have direct evidence. When they mentioned the paternity test idea when they were drunk, it stuck with Frank, leading him to get the test. The child isn't his, and now Annie is in a tough spot financially, moving back in with her parents. The author's family is upset with them for causing the breakup.\n\nThe author argues that Annie created the situation by cheating and that using the child as an excuse is unfair. They're standing by their suggestion of the test. But some might say the author overstepped by suggesting the test without more evidence. Even if they had a feeling, bringing it up in a vulnerable moment (after drinking) could be seen as irresponsible. The author might be seen as inserting themselves into a marriage they weren't part of, leading to the breakdown.\n\nOn the other hand, if Annie was indeed cheating and emotionally involved with someone else, the author's concern could be valid. But the author didn't have proof, just a feeling. Suggesting a paternity test is a drastic step. Even if the intention was to uncover the truth, the method might be questionable. Plus, the author's suggestion was made in a social setting, not a direct confrontation, which complicates things.\n\nThe key points here are whether the author had the right to suggest the test and if their actions were justified given the evidence. Since the author didn't have concrete proof but acted on a suspicion, they might be seen as overstepping. Frank's decision to get the test was his own, but the author's comment was the catalyst. This could make the author partially responsible for the fallout, even if Annie was at fault for cheating.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't have enough evidence to justify pushing for a paternity test, and their suggestion led to the marriage's collapse. However, if Annie's cheating was the root cause, maybe both parties have some blame. But the question is about the author's wrongdoing. Since the author acted on a hunch without proof, they might be at fault. But others might argue that supporting Frank in uncovering the truth was right. It's a bit of a gray area, but the answer might lean towards A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because of the lack of evidence and the role their comment played in the situation.\n"
