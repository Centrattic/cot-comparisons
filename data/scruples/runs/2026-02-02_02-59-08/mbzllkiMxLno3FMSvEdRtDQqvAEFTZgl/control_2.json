It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by understanding the situation. The author is friends with Annie, who married Frank. Frank works in oil, so he's away a lot. The author suspected that Annie was cheating but didn't have proof. Then when Annie and Frank announced a baby, the author, after some drinks, suggested a paternity test. This led Frank to get the test, which revealed the baby wasn't his. Now the author is getting flack from family for causing the marriage to fall apart and is supporting Frank.\n\nFirst, the question is about whether the author is wrong. The key points here are: Did the author have a right to make that comment? Frank was the one who acted on it by getting the test. So the author's comment was a suggestion, not the actual cause of the paternity test. However, the author might have overstepped by making that comment without having concrete evidence. But maybe they had a suspicion based on previous behavior. The author's intention was to help Frank discover the truth, which he did. However, the method of suggesting it after drinking might have been careless. \n\nAnnie was the one cheating, so the author's stance that Annie created the situation is valid. However, the author's interference led to the breakup, so some might argue the author shouldn't have meddled. But others might say it's justified since Annie was unfaithful. The author is now being blamed for the fallout, but they might not be at fault because they were trying to uncover the truth. The fact that Frank acted on the suggestion is his choice. The author didn't force him to do the test. So the author's role was just a catalyst, but the real issue was Annie's infidelity. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The answer is B.\n"
