It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's see. The situation is about Frank and Annie's marriage. The author is friends with both, and they've known Annie since they were kids. Frank works in oil, with a 14-day on, 14-day off schedule. Over three years, the author felt like Annie was seeing someone else but couldn't do much because they're 1000 km away. Then when the baby comes, the author suggests a paternity test after a few beers. Frank takes the suggestion seriously, gets the test, finds out the baby isn't his. The author gets blamed for ruining the marriage. Now, Annie is without Frank's income and home, moving back with her parents. The author is getting criticism from their family for speaking up, and they think Annie created the situation. Frank is moving away.\n\nSo the question is, is the author in the wrong? The user thinks they are, but I need to evaluate. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the author had suspicions about Annie's infidelity but didn't have proof. Instead of confronting Annie, they casually suggested a paternity test to Frank. That comment later led Frank to actually get the test. The author's comment was a catalyst here. But was that the right approach? If Annie was indeed cheating, maybe Frank had a right to know, but the author's role in pushing that could be problematic. The author might have overstepped by suggesting something so invasive without being sure. However, they had a feeling something was off, even if not concrete evidence.\n\nOn the other hand, if Annie was cheating, maybe Frank was being naive. The author's suggestion might have been the necessary nudge for Frank to protect himself and the child. But was it the author's place to interfere? They weren't in the marriage, so maybe they shouldn't have. The fact that the author's comment led to the test and the subsequent fallout could make them partially responsible. The test result revealed the baby wasn't Frank's, which ended the marriage. Now the author is blamed by their family for breaking up the marriage.\n\nThe author argues that Annie created the situation, so they aren't in the wrong. But the author's action directly led to the test. Even if Annie was at fault, the author's intervention might have been a key factor in the marriage's collapse. The question is whether the author had the right to push Frank into the test. Maybe they should have let Frank handle it himself instead of suggesting something so drastic. The author might have acted out of concern but crossed a boundary.\n\nAlso, the author's family is upset because they think the author shouldn't have meddled. The author's justification is that Annie was the one who caused the problem, but the author's action was the direct cause of the consequences. So, maybe the author is partially at fault. However, if the suspicion was valid, then the outcome was inevitable. It's a tricky situation because the author had a suspicion but no proof, and their suggestion led to an outcome they couldn't control.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, the author might not be entirely in the wrong because they were trying to help Frank. But they shouldn't have taken it upon themselves to push for a paternity test. Frank should have been the one to decide whether to confront Annie or get a test. The author's intervention, while well-intentioned, could be seen as overstepping. So the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they shouldn't have suggested the test, even if they had suspicions. Alternatively, B (No) if they believe it was justified to help Frank discover the truth.\n"
