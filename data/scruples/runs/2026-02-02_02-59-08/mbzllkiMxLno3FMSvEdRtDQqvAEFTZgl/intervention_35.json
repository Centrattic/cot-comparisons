It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's sister figure, Annie, who was married to Frank. The author suggested a paternity test, which led to Frank discovering Annie was cheating and the child wasn't his. Now Frank is leaving the marriage, and the author is getting criticized for speaking up.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author had a close relationship with Annie since childhood and felt something was off, maybe due to Frank's absence on the oil platform. The author's suggestion led to the test, which uncovered the infidelity. The key points here are the author's intention and whether they had the right to intervene.\n\nThe author's motivation might have been concern for Frank, given the long-term relationship with the couple. However, suggesting a paternity test is a sensitive action. Even if there were suspicions, the author didn't have concrete proof. The test was a direct accusation, which could have destroyed the marriage without being necessary if there was no evidence.\n\nEthically, everyone has the right to their own relationships, but inserting oneself into someone else's marriage to the point of causing a breakup is questionable. The author might have overstepped by making a comment after drinking, which led to Frank taking action. The consequences were significant for all involved, especially the child and the financial stability for Annie.\n\nOn the other hand, if Annie was indeed cheating, then Frank was the victim. The author's role was to support Frank, but the method of intervention might have been inappropriate. The author didn't act as a passive observer but took an active role in causing the dissolution of the marriage, which is a big step.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author's actions directly led to the test, which Frank used as proof. Even if the author's intentions were good, they might be at fault for not respecting the privacy of the marriage. The family is criticizing the author, which adds to the complexity. The question is whether the author had the right to interfere in that way.\n\nConsidering all this, I think the author is in the wrong because they acted on a suspicion without proof and their intervention led to the breakdown of the marriage. The right approach might have been to talk to Frank privately and let him decide, rather than making a public comment that led to a test. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
