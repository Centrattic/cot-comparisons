It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the given scenario is in the wrong. The story is about someone (the author) who supported their friend Frank after he found out his wife Annie had cheated on him, leading to the end of their marriage. The author suggested a paternity test, which led to the discovery that the child isn't Frank's. Now, the author is being criticized by their family for ruining the marriage and causing conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author's role was to be a supportive friend to Frank, who was in a troubled marriage. The author suspected infidelity but couldn't do much from a distance. When Frank was about to become a father, the author suggested a paternity test, which turned out to be valid. However, this suggestion came after some drinking, and Frank later insisted on the test. The consequences are that Annie is now without financial support and moving back in with her parents, while Frank and the author face isolation from their families.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants others' opinions. The possible answers are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI need to consider if the author overstepped by suggesting the paternity test. Even though the author had suspicions, directly suggesting a test could be seen as interfering in a personal relationship. However, the author might have believed they were helping a friend in a tough situation. Frank's decision to take action was his own, even if the suggestion came from the author. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's suggestion was based on a feeling, not concrete evidence. This could have led to unnecessary harm if Annie was innocent. However, the story states that Frank later confirmed the infidelity, so the suspicion was correct. The author's intention was to help, but the method might have been problematic. \n\nThe family is blaming the author, which adds to the complexity. The author might not be entirely at fault, as they were trying to support a friend. However, the way they approached the situation could be questioned. The key is whether the author's actions were justified given the lack of evidence. Even if the outcome was correct, the process might have been flawed. \n\nIn conclusion, there's a balance between supporting a friend and overstepping. Since the author acted on suspicion without proof, it's possible they are in the wrong. However, the intention was to help, and the outcome was accurate. The answer might hinge on whether the means justified the ends. Given that the author's suggestion led to the discovery of infidelity and the marriage ended, but the method was questionable, it's a bit of a gray area. However, since the author's actions were based on suspicion without certainty, they might be considered in the wrong. So, answer A (Yes).\n"
