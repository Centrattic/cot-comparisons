It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this story is in the wrong. The story is about a person who's supporting their sister-in-law Annie's husband Frank after he discovered she cheated. The author suggested a paternity test, which led to the revelation that the child isn't Frank's. Now people are blaming the author for ruining the marriage.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author and Annie have been close since childhood. Frank works in a job where he's away a lot, and Annie was suspected of cheating. The author, after some drinking, suggested a paternity test, which Frank took seriously. The test confirmed the child isn't his, leading to the breakup. Now, the author is getting criticized for speaking up.\n\nThe question is whether the author is at fault. Let's consider the key points. The author noticed something was off but didn't have concrete evidence. They brought up the idea of a paternity test, which Frank later acted on. The author's intention was to help Frank verify the paternity, which, in hindsight, was the right thing because it exposed the infidelity. However, the method might be questioned. Was it appropriate for the author to suggest this without being certain? \n\nBut in such cases, people often feel uncertain. The author might have had good intentions, thinking they were protecting Frank from being a single father to someone else's child. On the other hand, if the suggestion was made without evidence, maybe it was overstepping. However, the story mentions that the author had a feeling for a while, so there's some basis for concern. Plus, the test confirmed the suspicion, which means the author's action led to the truth coming out, which is generally seen as the right outcome in such scenarios.\n\nThe criticism from family is that the author shouldn't have said anything. But if Annie was indeed cheating and the child isn't Frank's, keeping quiet could have caused more long-term harm. The author's action, while awkward, resulted in the truth being revealed, which might be the morally correct choice. The author isn't the one who cheated; they were trying to help Frank. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The answer should be B, No.\n"
