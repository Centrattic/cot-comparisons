It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for supporting the cheated-on husband, Frank, after suggesting a paternity test that led to the discovery of the affair.\n\nFirst, the situation: Frank and Annie were married. Frank was away for work a lot. The author felt something was off and, after some drinks, suggested a paternity test. Frank later insisted on the test, which revealed the baby wasn't his. The author is now being criticized by family for \"ruining the marriage\" and using the child as an excuse.\n\nThe author's defense is that Annie created the situation by cheating, and they don't think it's fair to bring up the child. They support Frank despite the fallout, and now both Frank and the author are isolated.\n\nSo, who's in the wrong here? Well, the author's main action was suggesting the paternity test. But did they have the right to do that? The author didn't know for sure Annie was cheating, just had a feeling. However, they were close friends with Annie since childhood, so maybe they felt some responsibility to protect Frank. But suggesting the test without certain evidence could be seen as meddling. On the other hand, Frank was the one who insisted on the test, so the author's comment was just a suggestion. If Frank made the decision himself, maybe the author isn't fully responsible.\n\nAnnie is the one who cheated, so she's clearly at fault. But the author's role is in question. The author might have acted out of concern, but their suggestion led to the test and the subsequent fallout. However, without the test, Frank might still be unaware of the infidelity. The author's support for Frank isn't the issue; the problem is whether they overstepped by suggesting the test.\n\nBut considering that the author isn't a party to the marriage and lives far away, their ability to intervene was limited. They might have thought they were helping. However, suggesting a paternity test based on a feeling is a big step. It's possible the author acted impulsively after drinking, which complicates things. Frank taking the suggestion seriously and proceeding with the test is his choice, though.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author did what they thought was right to protect their friend. But maybe they shouldn't have brought up the paternity test without more concrete evidence. However, since Frank ended up acting on it, the author's role is indirect. The main wrongdoer is Annie for cheating. The author's actions, while perhaps well-intentioned, might have caused harm, but they weren't the one who committed the infidelity.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a grey area. They didn't have malicious intent, but their action led to the breakdown of the marriage. However, they're not the one who cheated. Maybe the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they suggested a test that caused the marriage to end, even if indirectly. But others might say the real issue is Annie's cheating. The question is whether the author overstepped. Alternatively, maybe the answer is B (No) because they were trying to help and the main fault lies with Annie.\n\nHmm. The user originally thinks the author is in the wrong. But I'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because they acted from a place of concern, even if it had unintended consequences. However, the suggestion of the test might have been inappropriate. It's a tough call. But in terms of responsibility, since the author wasn't involved in the actual cheating, and Frank made the choice to get the test, maybe the author isn't at fault. So B (Not in the wrong).\n"
