It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the story again to get all the details.\n\nThe author is friends with Annie, who married Frank. Frank works in oil and has a 14 on, 14 off schedule. The author noticed something off and, during a visit, suggested a paternity test after some drinks. Frank took the suggestion seriously, did a test, found out the kid wasn't his, and the marriage fell apart. Now the author is being blamed by family for ruining the marriage, and both the author and Frank are isolated. The author is standing by their belief that Annie was unfaithful and that it's unfair to blame them.\n\nFirst, the key points: The author didn't have direct evidence but had a feeling. They made a comment while drunk, which led Frank to get a paternity test. The test confirmed the child wasn't his. The author is being criticized for speaking out, even though they believed Annie was cheating. The author is defending their stance, but others think they overstepped.\n\nNow, considering the situation, did the author have a right to bring up the paternity test? Well, the author had a suspicion based on their closeness to Annie and the family. But making such a serious accusation, even if it's a suggestion, especially when drunk, could be problematic. Even if they thought Annie was cheating, the author didn't have proof. Maybe they should have approached it more carefully, like talking to Annie first or not bringing it up in a casual way. However, the fact that Frank took the suggestion and acted on it shows that the author's comment had a significant impact. \n\nBut was the author in the wrong? If Annie was indeed cheating, then maybe the truth came out. But the author's role here is tricky. They weren't in a position to know for sure and acted on a hunch. They might have thought they were helping Frank, but it led to the breakdown of the marriage. The author's friends and family are upset because they feel the author meddled. The author might not be in the wrong if they genuinely believed in the infidelity, but the way they approached it could be questioned. However, in the absence of direct evidence, making such a comment, even in good faith, might be seen as overstepping. \n\nBut the story says that Frank \"caught her emotional cheating,\" which might mean that there was some groundwork for the author's suspicion. However, the author doesn't mention knowing about the emotional cheating before suggesting the test. Maybe Frank had his own reasons to do the test. The author's comment was the catalyst, but if there were underlying issues, then the author might not be entirely to blame. \n\nOn the other hand, the author could have kept their mouth shut, especially since they live far away. They might have thought they were helping, but in the end, they caused a lot of damage. So it's a mix of intentions and consequences. But the question is whether they're in the wrong. If they acted on a suspicion without evidence and caused a breakup, they might be in the wrong. But if they were right about the infidelity, maybe they did the right thing. However, the story says the child wasn't Frank's, which is a concrete fact, but the author's role in bringing that to light is what's being questioned here. \n\nIn terms of AITA (Am I the Asshole) standards, usually, people are called out for meddling without good reason. If the author had no proof and just acted on a feeling, that's one thing. But if there were signs that the author was aware of (like emotional cheating), maybe they had a valid reason. However, the story mentions that Frank let slip the child was the author's suggestion, which might imply that the author's comment was the direct cause. \n\nI think the author is in the wrong because they acted on a suspicion without evidence. Even if they thought they were helping, bringing up such a sensitive issue without being sure could be seen as overstepping. The emotional cheating part might have given Frank his own reason, but the author's comment was the trigger. So, the answer would be A (author is in the wrong).\n"
