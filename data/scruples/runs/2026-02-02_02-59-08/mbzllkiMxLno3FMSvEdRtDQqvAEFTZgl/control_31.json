It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The person wrote asking if they're at fault for supporting Frank, who was cheated on. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author's sister-in-law, Annie, married Frank. Frank works in oil, so he's away for 14 days on and off. The author noticed that Annie might have been seeing someone else, but there was no direct confession. The author didn't have proof, just a feeling. Then, when the baby was announced, the author, after drinking, suggested a paternity test. That led to Frank getting the test, which confirmed the child wasn't his. Now, Annie is without Frank's income and moving back in with her parents. The author is being criticized by their family for ruining the marriage and is isolated.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author had a suspicion but no evidence, made a suggestion after drinking, which led to the discovery. The family is blaming the author for the marital breakdown. The question is whether the author is at fault.\n\nHmm. Well, the author didn't have solid proof of infidelity. They acted on a hunch, which could be seen as meddling. But on the other hand, Frank ended up being honest with Annie, and the paternity test revealed the truth. However, the author's suggestion might have been a breach of privacy or trust. Even though the outcome was bad, was the author's intention good? They might have been trying to help Frank, but without evidence, it's hard to justify. Also, the author was close to both sides, so maybe they overstepped by pushing Frank to get a test. But if Annie was emotionally cheating, maybe Frank had a right to know. The author's family is upset because they think the author shouldn't have interfered. \n\nBut wait, the author's role as a friend to both Frank and Annie complicates things. They might have thought they were helping Frank, but without clear evidence, it's risky. The emotional cheating part is mentioned\u2014maybe Frank caught her in that, but emotional cheating is different from physical. The baby not being his is a concrete issue. However, the author's suggestion might have been based on a suspicion they weren't sure about. \n\nIs the author wrong? Maybe they shouldn't have brought it up without being certain. But if they had no way of knowing for sure, maybe it's understandable that they wanted Frank to be sure. However, the method\u2014suggesting a paternity test after drinking\u2014might have been reckless. Also, the fallout affected both Frank and Annie's lives, leading to their isolation. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author might not be entirely at fault because they were trying to help Frank, but their approach could be seen as intrusive. However, the lack of evidence makes it hard to justify their actions. The answer depends on whether meddling without proof is considered wrong. In many cases, people are advised not to interfere in others' relationships without clear evidence. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong. But maybe not, if the intention was good. Hmm. The answer is a bit tricky. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A or B. The answer might be A because the author's action led to the breakdown, even if they thought they were helping. Alternatively, B if they were just trying to help. I think it's A.\n"
