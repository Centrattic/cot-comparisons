It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA story is in the wrong. The story is about Frank and Annie. The author is a close friend of Annie, almost like a sister. Annie married Frank, who works in oil and has a work schedule of two weeks on and two weeks off. The author had a suspicion that Annie was cheating but didn't know for sure. Then when there's a baby on the way, the author, after drinking, suggested a paternity test. Frank took it seriously, did the test, found out the baby wasn't his, and the marriage fell apart. Now the author is being blamed by family and friends for ruining the marriage and causing Annie to lose her husband and home.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user's initial thought is that the author is wrong, but they want others' opinions. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, did the author have a right to question the paternity? They were close to Annie and Frank. But how did they approach it? They made a comment to Frank after several beers. The comment was just to consider a paternity test. The author didn't know for sure that Annie was cheating, just had a feeling. Frank ended up taking the advice and it led to the marriage breaking down. The author's parents and siblings are blaming them, saying they should have kept quiet and considering the child's well-being. The author is defending themselves by saying Annie created the situation and using the child as a reason is unfair.\n\nOn one hand, the author's suspicion might have been based on no concrete evidence. They might have acted out of concern for Frank, thinking he was being cheated on. But if there was no proof, maybe the author overstepped. Even if the suspicion was genuine, suggesting a paternity test without knowing for sure could lead to a breakup. However, Frank also chose to act on the author's suggestion. He didn't have to take it seriously. The fact that he did implies he might have had doubts too.\n\nOn the other hand, Annie was cheating, and the baby isn't Frank's. The author might have thought they were helping Frank by getting to the truth. But the way it was brought up\u2014after drinking\u2014might not have been the best approach. The author's comment led directly to the paternity test, which exposed the infidelity. The author's intentions could be good, but the method might be questionable. However, the consequences were severe for everyone involved.\n\nIs the author responsible for the outcome? They didn't force Frank to take the test. Frank had the choice to act on the advice. The author's role was to voice a concern they had. But since there was no proof, maybe the author shouldn't have brought it up. Alternatively, maybe it's understandable to check for paternity when there's a real suspicion, especially with a spouse who is away for long periods.\n\nThe key points here are intent vs. outcome. The author's intent was to help Frank, but the outcome was a broken marriage and family conflicts. However, Annie is the one who cheated, so the responsibility for the marriage's end might lie more with her. The author might not be entirely at fault because they weren't directly involved in the infidelity. But they did play a role in uncovering it, which caused the breakup. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the focus is often on the person's actions and whether they crossed a line. Here, the author's action was suggesting a paternity test based on suspicion. If there's no proof, is that a line crossed? It might be, but if the suspicion was genuine, perhaps not. It's a bit of a gray area. The author might be in the wrong for interfering without evidence, but then again, if Frank was being cheated on, maybe the author is justified. \n\nConsidering all factors, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because the author acted on a suspicion without proof and their comment directly led to the paternity test. However, some might argue that they were helping Frank uncover the truth. The situation is complex, but in terms of responsibility, the author's role in initiating the test could be seen as overstepping. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
