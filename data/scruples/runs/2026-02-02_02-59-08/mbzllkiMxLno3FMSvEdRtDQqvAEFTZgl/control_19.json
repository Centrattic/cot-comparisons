It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person asking is wondering if they're in the wrong for supporting Frank, the cheated-on husband. The situation is that Frank's wife, Annie, was cheating emotionally and had a child that isn't his. The author, who's a close friend since childhood, suggested a paternity test after some drinking. Now, Frank found out, the marriage ended, and the author is getting criticized for causing the breakup.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the dynamics. Cheating is a serious issue, and emotional cheating can be as damaging as physical. The author noticed something off but wasn't sure. They made a comment about a paternity test in a casual setting, which Frank took to heart. The key points are: Did the author overstep? Was there a responsibility to not interfere? \n\nAnnie had been cheating for three years, which is a major betrayal. The author's intention was to make sure Frank was not being deceived. Even if the comment was off-handed, it led to the truth coming out. The author might think they were protecting Frank from further harm. However, some might argue that the author shouldn't have brought up the paternity test without being certain, especially since it led to a breakdown in the marriage and affected the child.\n\nBut considering that Annie was the one cheating and creating the situation, the author's support for Frank might be justified. The author isn't directly causing the cheating; they're helping Frank realize the truth. The friends and family might be in denial about Annie's actions, shifting blame onto the author. The author's action led to Frank's empowerment, even if it caused short-term pain.\n\nOn the other hand, the author could have approached it differently. Maybe a more direct confrontation with Frank in a sober setting instead of a joking comment after drinking. But the underlying issue was Annie's infidelity. The author's intentions were likely good, aiming to prevent Frank from being in a deceptive relationship. The consequences were significant, but the root cause was Annie's actions.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Probably not. They tried to expose a harmful situation. The blame should be on Annie for the cheating, not the author for helping uncover it.\n"
