It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong. The author here is the person who told Frank to consider a paternity test after suspecting Annie was cheating. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author and Annie have been close friends since childhood, almost like siblings. Frank works in the oil industry with a 14-day on/off schedule, which might contribute to a long-distance marriage. Annie didn't openly admit to cheating but the author had suspicions. Then, when they found out Annie was pregnant, the author, after drinking, suggested a paternity test. Frank took that suggestion seriously, leading to the discovery that the child isn't his.\n\nThe author is now facing backlash from their family, who think they shouldn't have intervened. The author feels Annie was at fault, but others are criticizing them for causing the breakup. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nSo, what are the key points here? The author's intention was to help a friend in a situation where they suspected infidelity. However, the method was a suggestion made under the influence of alcohol, which might not have been the best time to bring it up. Even though the author had a feeling something was off, they didn't have concrete evidence. The suggestion led to Frank finding out the truth, which caused the marriage to end and significant fallout for both Frank and the author.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the author might have thought they were helping, but they didn't have the right to interfere in another person's marriage, even if they were close to the spouse. The author's suggestion, even if well-intentioned, might have overstepped privacy boundaries. Also, the fallout shows that the marriage was troubled, and the author's comment acted as a catalyst. However, Annie was indeed cheating, so the truth came out eventually. \n\nBut the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. Legally, maybe not, but morally, it's tricky. The author didn't have proof, and the suggestion was made in a way that might not have been appropriate. On the other hand, the cheater is Annie, so the author was trying to help Frank. But the method was problematic. \n\nSo, considering all that, I think the answer is a bit of both. But since the options are A or B, and the user is asking if the author is in the wrong, I have to choose. I think the author's actions were misguided, but not entirely their fault. However, given that the author didn't have proof and the suggestion led to significant consequences without their consent, maybe the author is in the wrong. Alternatively, maybe not, because they were trying to help a friend. \n\nHmm. It's a tough call. But generally, people shouldn't meddle in others' relationships unless there's a clear harm. The author had suspicions but no proof, so acting on those suspicions might be crossing a line. Therefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
