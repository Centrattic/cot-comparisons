It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the person (the author) is in the wrong for supporting the husband who was cheated on. The situation is that Frank and Annie got married, Frank was away a lot, and the author noticed something off. Later, when Annie got pregnant, the author suggested a paternity test to Frank, which led to the discovery that he wasn't the father. Now, Annie is without Frank's income and home, and the author is getting criticized for \"ruining the marriage.\"\n\nFirst, I need to assess the actions of each party. The author's role was suggesting a paternity test. The key points here are: Annie cheated (emotional cheating mentioned, but also the baby isn't Frank's), and the author's comment led to the test. The author was a close friend to both, which adds complexity because they were supposed to be neutral but took a side.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, if the author had no proof but felt something was wrong, suggesting a test could be seen as interfering. However, if there were legitimate reasons to believe the baby wasn't Frank's (like Annie's possible infidelity), the author might have thought they were helping. But the problem is that the author's suggestion caused the breakup, leading to Annie's current situation and Frank's isolation. \n\nThe author's defense is that Annie created the situation, and using the child as a reason to criticize Frank is unfair. But the author's action directly led to the paternity test, which exposed the infidelity and the child's paternity. So, while Annie is at fault for cheating, the author's role in escalating the situation by suggesting the test might make them partially responsible for the fallout. \n\nHowever, does the author have a responsibility to stay out of it? Since they were friends, they might have felt it was their duty to help Frank, especially if they noticed signs of cheating. But pushing for a paternity test without concrete evidence could be seen as overstepping. The author's intention was to help, but the consequences were severe. \n\nIn some perspectives, the author isn't wrong because they were trying to protect their friend from being deceived. On the other hand, they didn't have the authority to make that decision, and their interference caused a family breakdown. The line between helping and interfering is thin here. \n\nThe community's judgment might lean on whether the author had a right to intervene. If the author acted without overstepping and in good faith, they might not be in the wrong. But if they acted out of suspicion without giving Annie the benefit of the doubt, that could be problematic. \n\nConsidering all this, the answer isn't clear-cut. The author's action had consequences, but the root issue is Annie's infidelity. If the author didn't have malicious intent, they might not be in the wrong. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but some might argue A (in the wrong) because their action led to the breakup. However, given that Annie was unfaithful and the author was trying to help a friend, B seems more justified.\n"
