It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the story) is in the wrong. The situation involves Frank and Annie's marriage, where Annie cheated, leading to Frank finding out the child isn't his. The author, who's close to both, suggested a paternity test, which led to the marriage breaking down.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points. The author is a close friend of both Frank and Annie. The question is whether suggesting the paternity test was wrong. The author felt something was off, so after some drinking, mentioned the test. Frank took it seriously and got the test done. The result confirmed the infidelity. Now, the author is being criticized by their family for causing the breakup, and they're defending their stance that Annie was at fault.\n\nSo, is the author at fault here? Well, the author didn't know for sure that Annie was cheating; they just had a feeling. They didn't have evidence but still brought it up. However, their intention was to help Frank verify the paternity of his child, which is a valid concern given the circumstances. On the other hand, bringing up such a sensitive topic, especially after drinking, might have been premature or not the best approach. But if the suspicion was genuine and the suggestion led to uncovering the truth, maybe the author was justified.\n\nBut the author's main action was suggesting the test. The problem is, without concrete evidence, bringing up such an accusation could be seen as invasive. However, given the context that the author had been noticing things over time and the marriage was already strained, maybe they had a right to express their concern. The fact that Annie was emotionally cheating and the child isn't Frank's means the situation was broken regardless. So the author might not be entirely at fault for trying to help Frank uncover the truth, even if the method was a bit off.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's role as a friend to both complicates things. They might have overstepped by inserting themselves into the relationship dynamics without being certain. But since they were close to both and had a long-term bond, their concern might be genuine. The key here is whether the author's suggestion was the catalyst for the breakup or if the marriage was already doomed. Since Annie was cheating and the child wasn't Frank's, the marriage's collapse was inevitable. So the author's suggestion might have just expedited the truth coming out, which could be seen as the right thing to do.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's approach could have been more tactful, their intention was to help Frank uncover the truth about his marriage. Since Annie was the one who was unfaithful, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The responsibility lies more with Annie for her actions. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
