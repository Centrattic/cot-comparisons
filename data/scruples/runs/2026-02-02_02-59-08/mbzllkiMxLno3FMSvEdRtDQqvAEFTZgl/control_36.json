It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong for supporting the cheated-on husband. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author is a close friend of Annie, almost like a sister, and has known her since childhood. Annie married Frank, who works in the oil industry with a 14-day on/off schedule. The author suspected Annie was cheating but didn't have direct evidence. Then there's a baby on the way, and the author, after some beers, suggests a paternity test, which leads Frank to find out the child isn't his. The paternity test also revealed emotional cheating. Now Annie is left without Frank's income and home, and the author is getting blamed by their family for ruining the marriage. The author stands by their actions, believing Annie was at fault, and both they and Frank are now isolated.\n\nSo, the key points here are the author's role in suggesting the paternity test. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI need to consider if the author overstepped. The author had suspicions but no proof. Suggesting a paternity test, even if it's a feeling, could be seen as interfering. However, the husband was eventually vindicated since the child isn't his. The author's intention might have been to help Frank uncover the truth. But maybe the way it was approached was problematic, especially after drinking. Also, the author's family is upset because they think the author shouldn't have meddled. \n\nOn the other hand, Annie was cheating, and the author was close to her, possibly aware of the situation. The author's actions led to the truth coming out, which might have been necessary for Frank. However, the method of bringing it up might not have been the best, especially without concrete evidence. \n\nIt's a tricky situation. The author might not be in the wrong because they were trying to help Frank, but they might have crossed a line by not being certain and causing a breakup. Alternatively, since the cheating was real and the author's suggestion led to Frank discovering it, maybe they weren't wrong. But the emotional impact on everyone involved is significant. \n\nI think the key factors are the lack of direct evidence and the context of being under the influence when making the suggestion. However, the outcome was that Frank found out the truth, which might have been necessary. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong because they were acting on genuine concerns, even if the approach wasn't perfect. The answer might lean towards B (No). But some might argue that the author shouldn't have interfered without being sure. Hmm.\n"
