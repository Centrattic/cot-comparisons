It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the AITA post) is in the wrong for supporting the husband who got cheated on. The situation involves Frank and Annie, where Annie was emotionally unfaithful and had a child with someone else. The author, being a close friend of both, suggested a paternity test which led to the discovery.\n\nFirst, the author's intention was to address the suspicion they had about the child's paternity. They mention that Annie had been acting in a way that made them suspect something, but there was no direct confession. Emotionally cheating is a gray area\u2014does that count as cheating? It depends on the couple's definition, but generally, emotional infidelity can still be a form of betrayal.\n\nThe author's suggestion led Frank to get a paternity test, which confirmed the child wasn't his. Now, the author is being criticized for ruining the marriage and causing Annie to lose her financial stability and home. The family is blaming the author for meddling.\n\nBut here's the thing: the author wasn't trying to sabotage the marriage. They were acting on their concerns, even if they weren't 100% sure. The husband, Frank, had the final say in getting the test. The author's role was to voice a suspicion, which Frank then acted upon. The real issue is Annie's infidelity and deceit. The author is being held accountable for something that Frank ultimately decided to do. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? It's possible that the author overstepped by suggesting the test, but they weren't the one who made Frank take it. The blame should be on Annie for the infidelity and Frank for not being more involved earlier. The author's actions were based on concern for their friend's well-being. The key point is that the author didn't have malicious intent; they were trying to help. So, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong because the main fault lies with Annie's actions, not the suggestion itself.\n"
