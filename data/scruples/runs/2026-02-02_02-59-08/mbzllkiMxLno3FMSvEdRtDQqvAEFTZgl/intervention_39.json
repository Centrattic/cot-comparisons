It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for supporting the cheated-on husband, Frank, after suggesting a paternity test that led to the discovery of Annie's infidelity.\n\nFirst, the author knew Annie and Frank since childhood, with Annie being more like a sister. Frank was in a marriage where Annie was cheating, both emotionally and physically. The author, living far away, had suspected the infidelity but couldn't do much. Then, when a baby was on the way, the author, after drinking, suggested a paternity test. Frank later insisted on it, leading to the discovery that he wasn't the father. Now, Annie is left without Frank's income and home, and the author is blamed by their families for ruining the marriage.\n\nSo, the main points here: Did the author have the right to bring up the paternity test? Was it necessary? The author believed Annie was cheating but wasn't sure. By suggesting a paternity test, the author might have acted on a suspicion without concrete proof. However, Frank took the suggestion seriously and proceeded with the test, which revealed the infidelity. \n\nAnnie's actions were deceitful; she didn't directly admit to cheating. The author's action led to Frank finding out the truth, which is important for him to know, especially regarding the child's paternity. However, the author's role is questioned because they might have overstepped by bringing up the test when there wasn't clear evidence. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's intention was to help Frank uncover the truth, which he eventually did. The consequence was the breakdown of the marriage, but Annie was the one who committed the infidelity. The author might have acted out of concern for Frank, but did they have the right to intervene in such a personal matter without being directly asked?\n\nIt's a tricky situation. While the author's intention was to help, their method of doing so by suggesting a paternity test in a social setting might have been inappropriate. However, the main fault lies with Annie for her cheating. The author's role is more of a catalyst but not the primary wrongdoer. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author might share some blame for not approaching the situation more carefully. But given that Annie was the one who engaged in the affair, the author isn't entirely at fault. The key is whether the author had the right to interfere. Since they were close friends, they might have thought they were helping, but the way they did it could be seen as overstepping. \n\nSo, considering all angles, the author isn't entirely in the wrong. The main responsibility is on Annie for her actions. The author's suggestion led to the truth coming out, which is important, but the method could have been better. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
