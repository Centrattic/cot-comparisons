It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's sister figure, Annie, who married Frank. The author suspects Annie is cheating but can't act on it because they live far away. Then, the author suggests a paternity test to Frank during a drunken conversation. The test reveals the baby isn't Frank's, leading to the breakdown of the marriage. Now, the author is being criticized by family for ruining the marriage and is isolated.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's intent. Did they have a right to interfere? They mention they felt a suspicion but didn't have proof. By suggesting the paternity test, they were trying to uncover the truth. However, they did so in a casual, drunken conversation. That might not have been the best approach. \n\nNext, the consequences. The marriage ended, Annie is now in a tough spot financially, and Frank is moving away. The author's family thinks they should have stayed out of it. But the author argues that Annie was the one at fault. \n\nEthically, is it the author's responsibility to intervene? They had a close relationship with Annie and Frank, acting like a sister. Sometimes friends step in when they see something wrong. But did they overstep? Suggesting a paternity test is a serious step. Even if they had suspicions, maybe they should have tried to talk to Annie first or find more evidence. \n\nOn the other hand, Frank might have been in denial. The author's suggestion might have been the push he needed to take action. However, the way it was done\u2014impulsively during drinking\u2014could have been insensitive. Also, the author's role in the fallout is a factor. They're now being blamed, which might be unfair if they were trying to help. \n\nThe key points here are intent and method. The author's intent was to ensure Frank wasn't being wronged, which is understandable. The method was questionable, but intentions matter. However, the result is significant, and the author's actions directly led to the marriage's end. So, could they be seen as in the wrong? \n\nIn many cases, people feel they are justified if they are helping someone uncover infidelity. But the manner in which it's done can affect the judgment. The author might not be in the wrong because they were trying to protect Frank, but others might argue they overstepped. \n\nConsidering all that, the answer might hinge on whether the author's interference was justified. If they had a right to act on suspicions, especially given the close relationship, then B (Not in the wrong). If their method was reckless, then A (In the wrong). The story doesn't show malice; it's more about concern. So likely B.\n"
