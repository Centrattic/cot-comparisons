It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The question is whether the author, who suggested a paternity test that led to the discovery of infidelity, is in the wrong. \n\nFirst, looking at the situation: The author is close to Annie, who's his sister-like figure. Frank is married to Annie, and he's in the oil industry with a work schedule that keeps him away for two weeks on and two off. The author had a feeling Annie was cheating but wasn't certain. After some time, the author mentions a paternity test in a casual setting, which later leads Frank to actually get the test. The result shows he's not the father, and the author is blamed for the fallout.\n\nThe author argues that Annie was the one who created the situation, and using the child as a reason is unfair. The family is upset with the author for causing the marriage breakdown. The question is whether the author is wrong for supporting Frank and suggesting the test.\n\nI need to consider the dynamics here. The author wasn't directly involved in the marriage except as a friend. He had a suspicion but no evidence. Suggesting a paternity test might have been a way to confirm Frank's doubts. However, the author wasn't in a position to know for sure. But if the husband was already having feelings of insecurity and the author's comment pushed him to act, that could be problematic.\n\nOn the other hand, Annie was emotionally cheating, which is still a betrayal. The author's intention might have been to help Frank uncover the truth. But the method of bringing it up after drinking and leading to the test might not have been the best approach. Also, the author's role in a private matter between Frank and Annie could be seen as overstepping. The fact that the author's suggestion led to the breakdown of the marriage and the family's disapproval is a key point. \n\nIn some perspectives, the author acted out of concern for Frank, which is understandable. But in others, it's meddling in a personal relationship without being the spouse. The child's situation is also a factor\u2014being used as a reason not to address the cheating is a valid point. \n\nSo, considering all sides, the author might have crossed a line by intervening in a way that wasn't his responsibility. However, if the cheating was ongoing and the author had legitimate concerns, maybe it's a gray area. But the way it was done (after alcohol, not directly confronting Annie) might not be the best approach. I'm leaning towards the author being in the wrong because he wasn't the spouse and his actions led to the breakdown, even if from good intentions.\n"
