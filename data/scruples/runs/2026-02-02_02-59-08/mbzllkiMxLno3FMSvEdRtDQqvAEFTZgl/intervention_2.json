It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves Frank and Annie, where the author is a close friend to Annie. The author suspected Annie was cheating on Frank and, after a visit where they were drinking, suggested a paternity test. This led to Frank finding out the baby wasn't his because of the author's suggestion. Now the author is being blamed by their family for ruining the marriage and is defending their actions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author didn't have concrete evidence of the affair but had a feeling. They made a suggestion during a casual conversation after drinking. The suggestion led to Frank getting a paternity test, which revealed the infidelity. The author's family is upset because they think the author shouldn't have interfered, while the author believes Annie was the one who created the situation.\n\nThe main ethical question here is whether the author overstepped by suggesting the test. The author's intention might have been to help Frank, but without clear evidence, it's a big step to push for a paternity test. However, the author wasn't directly involved in the affair, so they might not be entirely at fault. On the other hand, Frank's decision to act on the suggestion led to the breakup, and the author is being blamed for that outcome.\n\nAlso, the author's family is criticizing them for the consequences, which include Frank being isolated and moving away. The author is standing by their belief that Annie was the one who created the situation. But does the author have a responsibility to not interfere without knowing for sure?\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author did make a suggestion based on suspicion, which is not proof. However, they weren't the one who committed the infidelity. The responsibility for the cheaters' actions lies with Annie. But the author's role in bringing the issue to light is what caused the breakup. So, is the author in the wrong for suggesting the test without more concrete evidence? It's a gray area. Some might argue that the author was looking out for Frank, while others might say they shouldn't have meddled without knowing the full story. The answer might depend on cultural or personal views on intervening in such situations.\n\nGiven that, I think the author is partially at fault for stepping in without clear evidence, but not entirely. However, since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, and considering that they acted on suspicion without proof, which led to breaking up the marriage, the answer might lean towards A (Yes, the author is in the wrong). But others might say B (No) because the cheater is Annie, not the author. It's a tough call. The key is whether the author's action was justified. Since they had a suspicion but no proof, and their suggestion led to the breakup, maybe they are at least partially responsible. But the main wrongdoer is Annie. The author's role is more of a catalyst. In some perspectives, the author did the right thing by helping Frank discover the cheating, even if it was uncomfortable. But in terms of being blamed for ruining the marriage, the author might not be entirely in the wrong. Hmm. This is tricky. Maybe the answer is B (No) because the author wasn't the one who cheated, but they did interfere which had consequences. Alternatively, A (Yes) because they acted on suspicion without certainty. I'm not sure. Need to decide based on the typical take on such AITA stories. Usually, if someone helps the wronged party discover an infidelity, even if it causes the breakup, they're seen as helping. However, if there's no proof and it's just suspicion, maybe it's different. But in this case, the test confirmed it. So the author's suggestion did lead to the truth. So perhaps the author isn't in the wrong because they were helping Frank uncover the betrayal. However, they did push for a test without knowing. So maybe the answer is B (No), the author is not in the wrong because they were trying to help the cheated-on spouse, even if it caused conflict. But I'm not 100% sure. Maybe there's a middle ground, but since the options are A or B, I need to pick one.\n"
