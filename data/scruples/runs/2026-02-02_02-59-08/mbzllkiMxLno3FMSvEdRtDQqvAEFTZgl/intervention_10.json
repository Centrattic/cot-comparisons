It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who posted the story) is in the wrong for supporting the husband who was cheated on. The situation involves Frank and Annie, where Annie cheated, the child isn't Frank's, and the author suggested a paternity test.\n\nFirst, the author's role: They knew Annie since childhood and were close. They noticed something off but couldn't do much because of the distance. When the pregnancy happened, they made a comment about a paternity test after drinking. Frank later took the suggestion seriously and got a test, which confirmed infidelity. Now, the author is being blamed by family for causing the breakup, leading to isolation for both Frank and the author.\n\nThe key questions here are whether the author had the right to make that suggestion and if they overstepped. They didn't have concrete evidence, just a feeling. The comment was made in a casual setting (after beers), which might not be the best time to bring up such a sensitive topic. Even though the intention was to ensure the child is Frank's, the method of suggesting it might have been inappropriate. The author didn't confront Annie directly or support Frank in a more constructive way. Instead, planting the idea could have been a catalyst for the breakup. Also, considering the aftermath, the author is being blamed by their own family, which complicates things.\n\nOn the other hand, the user argues that Annie created the situation by cheating, so the author isn't entirely at fault. But the question is about the author's actions specifically. Even if Annie was at fault, the author's role in bringing up the paternity test might have accelerated the inevitable. However, the author might have been trying to help Frank avoid being stuck with a child that's not his, which is a valid concern. It's a tricky situation because the author had a personal connection and might have overstepped but with good intentions.\n\nSo, weighing both sides, the author's advice, while well-intentioned, was delivered in a context where they didn't have all the facts. It's possible that they shouldn't have made that suggestion without more evidence. Therefore, the answer could be A (yes, the author is in the wrong) because their comment led to the paternity test that caused the breakup, even if Annie was at fault. But maybe it's B (not in the wrong) because they were trying to help Frank. However, the way they approached it was problematic. Hmm. I think the answer is A because the author's action directly contributed to the situation, even if Annie was the cheater. They didn't have the right to interfere in that way.\n"
