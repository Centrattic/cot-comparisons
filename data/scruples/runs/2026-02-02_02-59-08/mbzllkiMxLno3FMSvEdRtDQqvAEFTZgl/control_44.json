It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about their sister-in-law Annie, who cheated on her husband Frank. The author, who's close to Annie like a sibling, found out that Frank was being cheated on and suggested a paternity test. The test revealed the baby wasn't Frank's, leading to the marriage breaking up and Annie being left without financial support. Now the author is being blamed by their family for ruining the marriage.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. The author didn't have direct proof of the cheating but had a feeling. They were drinking when they suggested the paternity test, which Frank later took seriously. The key point here is whether the author overstepped by bringing up the test. But wait, if Annie was emotionally cheating and the baby wasn't Frank's, then the author's suggestion led to uncovering a betrayal. However, the author didn't have evidence, just a suspicion. \n\nWas it right to make that comment while drunk? Maybe not the best time to bring up such a serious suggestion. But was the author's intention wrong? They probably wanted to help Frank discover the truth. However, the way they approached it without concrete evidence might have been a mistake. \n\nThe author's family is blaming them for the fallout, but Annie was the one who cheated. The author is standing by their decision because Annie created the situation. From an ethics standpoint, is the author responsible for the consequences of Frank acting on their suggestion? It's a bit of a gray area. They didn't force Frank to do the test, but their comment influenced him. \n\nOn one hand, the author was trying to act in Frank's best interest by revealing the truth. On the other hand, they acted on suspicion without proof, which could be seen as meddling. The fact that Frank decided to take action on his own means the author isn't entirely to blame. The main responsibility lies with Annie for cheating. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author's actions were based on concern, but the method (suggesting a test without evidence, especially while drunk) might have been hasty. However, the real fault is Annie's for the infidelity. The author isn't in the wrong because they were trying to help, even if their approach wasn't perfect. The answer is B (No).\n"
