It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong for supporting the husband who got cheated on. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author's sister-in-law, Annie, had a baby that wasn't her husband Frank's. The author, who's close to Annie, suggested a paternity test after drinking, which led Frank to confirm the infidelity. Now, the author is being criticized by family for ruining the marriage and causing Annie and Frank to be isolated.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author did the right thing by bringing up the paternity test. The author believes Annie was the one who created the situation, so they feel justified. But others think the author should have stayed silent.\n\nI need to consider the ethics here. Cheating is morally wrong, but the author didn't have proof, just a feeling. By suggesting the test, the author might have acted out of concern for Frank, even if it was after drinking. However, the author didn't have concrete evidence, so maybe they overstepped. \n\nBut Frank did get the test done, which led to the truth coming out. Annie is the one who cheated, so the author's actions, while perhaps tactless, were pointing out a possible betrayal. The author might not be in the wrong because the infidelity was the root issue. However, the way it was approached\u2014after drinking and without certainty\u2014could be seen as careless. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's intention was to protect their friend Frank from being a single parent to someone else's child. Even if the method was flawed, the underlying concern wasn't unfounded. The blame here seems to lie more with Annie for the cheating, not the author for raising the question. \n\nSo, considering all angles, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The answer would likely be B (No). But I need to check if there's a point where the author's actions were intrusive without evidence. Since the author had a close relationship and a long-term suspicion, maybe their intervention was justified despite the approach. Thus, the answer is B.\n"
