It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The situation involves Frank and Annie, where the author (let's call them \"the narrator\") is a close friend of Annie's and Frank's. The key points are:\n\n1. Frank was cheating on Annie? Wait, no, wait. Wait, the story says that Frank was the one who cheated? Wait, no. Wait, the narrator says that Annie was cheating. Wait, let me recheck. The narrator mentions that during her visit, she suggested Frank consider a paternity test, which he did, and it turned out the kid wasn't his. So Annie was cheating on Frank. The narrator is the one who suggested the paternity test, leading to the discovery that Annie was unfaithful. Now, after that, Annie is left without Frank's income and home, moving back in with her parents. The narrator is being blamed by their family for ruining the marriage.\n\nThe question is whether the narrator is in the wrong for supporting Frank when he discovered the infidelity and took action. The narrator's position is that Annie created the situation (by cheating), and using the child as an argument is unfair. The narrator is being criticized for causing the breakup by suggesting the test.\n\nSo, to evaluate: Is the narrator wrong for suggesting the paternity test? Well, the test revealed the infidelity. The narrator wasn't directly involved in the cheating but noticed something and acted on it. However, did the narrator overstep? They live 1000 km away and couldn't intervene directly. When they visited, they mentioned the paternity test idea after some beers. The test led to the divorce. The family is saying the narrator should've stayed silent.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, if the narrator genuinely suspected infidelity and was concerned about Frank's potential to be a father to someone else's child, maybe they had a point in suggesting the test. However, they might have overstepped by making such a suggestion in a casual setting. But Frank acted on it, so the narrator isn't the one who ended the marriage\u2014they just provided the idea that led to the revelation.\n\nOn the other hand, the narrator's family is upset because they think the narrator ruined the marriage. But Annie was the one who cheated. The narrator's role was to bring to light a situation that was already harmful. However, the way it was brought up might have been inappropriate, especially if the narrator didn't have concrete evidence and just acted on a feeling. But given that Frank ended up getting a paternity test and the marriage collapsed, maybe the narrator isn't in the wrong because they were trying to protect Frank from being a father to another man's child.\n\nSo, considering all that, the narrator might not be in the wrong. They noticed something off and tried to help Frank, albeit in a perhaps awkward way. The real wrongdoing was Annie's infidelity and emotional cheating. The narrator's suggestion led to the truth coming out but wasn't the root cause of the problem. Therefore, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
