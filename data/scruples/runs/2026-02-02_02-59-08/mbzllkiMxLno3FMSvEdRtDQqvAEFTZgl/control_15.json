It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is a bit complicated. So, the author is a friend of Annie and Frank. They were close, almost like siblings. Frank was cheating, and Annie was the one who was unfaithful. The key point here is that the author suggested a paternity test to Frank, which led to the discovery that he wasn't the biological father of his child. Now, people are blaming the author for breaking up the marriage.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The author had suspicions about Annie for a while but didn't confront her directly. Instead, when visiting, they made a comment about paternity tests after some drinking. The comment stuck, and Frank decided to get one. The test revealed the infidelity. Now, the author is being criticized for interfering. \n\nIs the author responsible for Frank's decision? The author didn't know for sure that Annie was cheating, just had a feeling. They didn't have proof, but their suggestion led to Frank taking action. But was the suggestion justified? If Annie was emotionally cheating, maybe the author's concern was valid, but they didn't act on concrete evidence. However, suggesting a paternity test is a big step, especially without knowing if Frank wanted to pursue it. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is defending their position, saying that Annie created the situation. The author believes Frank was in the wrong for not confronting Annie earlier. The author's family is pressuring them to stay quiet, but they feel it's right to support Frank now. \n\nSo, is the author at fault? If the author acted out of concern and Frank made the choice to get the test, maybe the author isn't entirely wrong. But if they went out of their way to push Frank into something that destroyed his marriage, then they might be. The key is intent. The author might have thought they were helping, but did they overstep? Also, even if Annie was cheating, the author's role in exposing it through a suggestion could be seen as meddling. \n\nHowever, considering that the author had a close relationship with both parties and was close to Annie, they might have felt responsible. But suggesting a paternity test without evidence could be seen as crossing a line. Also, the fact that Frank later mentioned it was the author's idea complicates things. The author's comment might have been a catalyst, but Frank made the final decision. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, maybe the author isn't entirely in the wrong because they might have acted out of concern for Frank. However, they didn't have proof, just a suspicion. The author's actions led to a breakup and emotional damage, so they could be seen as partially responsible. But if they were trying to help, maybe they aren't in the wrong. It's a tough call. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the author's suggestion was an overreach without evidence. If the author had no proof and just acted on a feeling, that might be problematic. But if they were trying to alert Frank to a possible issue, maybe it's understandable. However, the fact that they live far away and only made a comment after drinking could imply that they weren't in the best position to intervene. \n\nIn the end, the author's intention might be to help, but the method of doing so (suggesting a paternity test) might be questionable. So, depending on the perspective, the author could be seen as not in the wrong because they were trying to help, but they might have overstepped. However, since the action had severe consequences, maybe they are partially at fault. But the question is if they are in the wrong. The answer might be B (No), because the author was trying to protect Frank from being cheated on, even if the approach was problematic.\n"
