It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the AITA post) is in the wrong for supporting the cheated-on husband, Frank, by suggesting a paternity test.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the facts. The author's sister, Annie, was married to Frank, who was in a job that kept him away for two weeks at a time. The author sensed something was off but didn't have direct proof. When a baby was on the way, the author, after some drinks, mentioned the possibility of a paternity test. Frank took that suggestion seriously and got a test, which confirmed the baby wasn't his. The author is now being blamed by family for ruining the marriage, and Frank is moving away, isolated.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is at fault. The key points to consider are intent and the consequences. The author had a suspicion based on feeling something was off. They were close to Annie and Frank, so their concern might be genuine. However, making such a suggestion, even if it's after drinking, could be seen as intrusive. But the main issue is that Annie was emotionally unfaithful, leading to Frank not being the biological father. The author's role was to express a suspicion, not to create the situation. The situation was already problematic due to Annie's actions.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's family is blaming them for speaking up. But if Annie was the one who was cheating, then the author isn't the one who caused the infidelity. The author's suggestion led to the truth coming out, which might have been inevitable. The author isn't responsible for Annie's choices. The family's reaction that the author should have stayed silent might be misplaced. The child's situation is also mentioned, but since Frank wasn't the biological father, the child's well-being might not be directly the author's fault.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the author tried to be honest and help Frank avoid being a father to someone else's child. While the method of bringing it up might have been awkward, especially after drinking, the underlying concern was valid. The author isn't in the wrong for acting on their suspicions, even if it caused conflict. The real blame lies with Annie for the infidelity and the consequences that followed.\n"
