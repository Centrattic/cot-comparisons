It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation involves Frank and Annie, their marriage, an affair, a baby that's not Frank's, and the author's suggestion leading to a paternity test. The author is getting criticized for causing the breakup by suggesting the test.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author is close to Annie, who's his sister-like figure. Frank is married to Annie and works in a job that keeps him away for two weeks at a time. The author had a feeling Annie was cheating but couldn't do much from afar. When a baby was announced, he jokingly suggested a paternity test after drinking. Frank took it seriously, got the test, and found out the baby wasn't his. Now the author is being blamed for ruining the marriage, and he's defending himself by saying Annie was the one who created the situation.\n\nThe main question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider the actions. The author made a comment while drunk, which led Frank to get a paternity test. The test revealed the infidelity. The author argues that Annie was at fault, but the family thinks he shouldn't have said anything.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, did the author overstep? Well, he had suspicions based on his close relationship with Annie. However, suggesting a paternity test is a serious step. Even if he was concerned, bringing it up in a joking manner after drinking might not be the right approach. But he didn't know for sure Annie was cheating; he just had a feeling. His intention might have been to help Frank uncover the truth, which he later did.\n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't have concrete evidence. He acted on a hunch, which led to a breakup and family conflict. The question is whether he has a responsibility to keep quiet. Since he's a close friend, maybe he felt it was his duty to speak up. But was it his place to intervene? Maybe not. Frank might have needed to address the issue himself.\n\nThe family's criticism is that the author ruined the marriage. But if the marriage was already in trouble due to Annie's actions, the author's comment was just the catalyst. The author might not be entirely at fault. However, he did play a role in the unraveling. But considering that Annie was the one cheating, the root cause is her. The author's action was a means to uncover the truth.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. He didn't have proof, but he acted on a suspicion to protect Frank. However, he didn't approach it responsibly. Maybe he should have talked to Frank privately first, not in a drunk, joking manner. But since the outcome was that Frank got the truth, maybe the author's intention was good. The answer could be B (not in the wrong) because the real fault lies with Annie. The author's role was minor compared to the actual cheater.\n"
