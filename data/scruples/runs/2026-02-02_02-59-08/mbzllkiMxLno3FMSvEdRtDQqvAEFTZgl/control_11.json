It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The story is about Frank and Annie's marriage. The author, who's close to Annie, suspected that Annie was cheating. Frank was in and out due to his job, so maybe that's why the relationship was strained. The author suggested a paternity test, and it turned out the baby wasn't Frank's. Now, Frank is upset, and the author is getting criticized for causing the breakdown.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. The author didn't know for sure that Annie was cheating; they just had a feeling. They mentioned the paternity test in a casual setting, maybe after drinking. Frank took the suggestion seriously and got the test done. The result showed he's not the father. Now, Annie is facing financial and housing issues because Frank is leaving.\n\nThe key points here are: Did the author overstep by bringing up the paternity test? Is it their responsibility to know for sure before making the comment? Also, the dynamics between the author and Annie\u2014being like a sister might mean they had a close relationship, which could explain why the author felt comfortable making the comment. But since they live far away, maybe they didn't have enough context.\n\nThe author's intention might have been to help Frank ensure the child is his, especially if they suspected something. But bringing it up in a social setting with alcohol could have been unwise. If Frank acted on that suggestion, leading to the discovery of the infidelity and the subsequent fallout, the author might feel they were trying to prevent ongoing harm. However, the method of introducing the idea informally might have been a mistake.\n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't have proof and was acting on a suspicion. The paternity test was the only way to confirm, and the result showed Annie was unfaithful. The author might believe they were helping Frank by pointing this out. But others are blaming the author for ruining the marriage, which is a valid criticism. The author's suggestion could be seen as meddling, even if with good intentions.\n\nIt's a tricky situation. The author didn't have malicious intent, but their comment led to the unraveling of the marriage. The question is whether they are responsible. Since they didn't have concrete evidence and the way they approached it might have been inappropriate, maybe they are in the wrong. However, if the marriage was already in trouble due to Annie's infidelity, the author's comment might have just been the catalyst for Frank to confront the truth. In that case, maybe the author isn't entirely in the wrong.\n\nBut considering the social context, the author was close to Annie, so they should have been cautious. The fact that they brought it up casually without being sure could be seen as crossing a line. The answer might lean towards A (wrong), but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, if the marriage was doomed because of Annie's cheating, the author's role was minimal. Hmm.\n"
