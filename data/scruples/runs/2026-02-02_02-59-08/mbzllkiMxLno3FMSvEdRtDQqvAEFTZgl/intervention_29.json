It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this story is in the wrong. The situation involves Frank and Annie's marriage. The author, who's close to Annie like a sister, suspected infidelity. Frank works in oil, so he's away for two weeks on, two off. The author didn't have concrete evidence but had a feeling. Then when Annie got pregnant, the author suggested a paternity test, which led to Frank finding out the baby wasn't his. Now the author is being blamed by family for ruining the marriage.\n\nFirst, considering the facts: the author didn't have direct knowledge of the affair. They acted on a suspicion, maybe even a hunch, but did they have a right to push for a paternity test? They might have thought they were helping Frank avoid a situation where he's raising someone else's child. But on the other hand, without evidence, suggesting a test could be seen as interfering in someone else's marriage. The author's family blames them, saying they should have kept quiet. The author argues that Annie was the one who created the situation, but the question is whether the author's actions were wrong.\n\nMoral considerations here are tricky. Intervening in a marriage is a big step. The author might have thought they were helping, but without proof, their suggestion could have been based on assumptions. However, if Annie was indeed being unfaithful, then the author might have been trying to protect Frank. But the key point is that the author didn't have evidence and acted on a suspicion. That could be seen as overstepping, especially since the marriage was between Frank and Annie. The author's role as a friend might not justify pushing for such a drastic step. Also, the consequences were severe for both Frank and the author. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, is it right to suggest something that could destroy a marriage without solid proof? The author's intention might have been good, but the action could be seen as meddling. On the flip side, if the child wasn't Frank's, then Annie had a responsibility to be honest. The author's suggestion led to the truth coming out, but maybe the method was inappropriate. \n\nIn terms of accountability, the author might not be entirely at fault because they were acting on a concern for a friend, but they didn't have the right to push for a paternity test. The decision should have been Frank's to make, especially since it's his paternity in question. The author's role was to support Frank, not to make decisions for him. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for overstepping their bounds. However, if Annie was indeed deceptive, there's a case that the author was trying to help. But since the author's action led to the breakup, which caused significant consequences, it's possible the author is at least partially at fault. \n\nSo, weighing all that, I think the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they intervened without sufficient evidence and potentially disrupted a marriage based on their suspicion. Even with good intentions, they crossed a line by suggesting the paternity test, which is a personal and sensitive matter that Frank should have addressed on his own terms.\n"
