It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the AITA question) is in the wrong. The situation involves their friend Annie's marriage to Frank, where the author suspects infidelity. The key points here are the author's actions and the consequences.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that Annie and Frank were married for three years, and during that time, there were signs that Annie might be cheating, but nothing was directly confirmed. The author, after some drinking, suggested a paternity test during a visit. This suggestion led Frank to insist on the test, which revealed the baby wasn't his. Now Frank is separated from Annie, she's without his income and home, and the author is being criticized for \"ruining\" the marriage.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is at fault. Let's break it down. The author's concern was based on suspicions, not concrete evidence. They live far away, so maybe they felt they couldn't intervene much. But by bringing up the paternity test idea, even if it was in a casual setting, they might have acted on their suspicions without knowing the full story. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's intention might have been to ensure Frank's child was actually his, which is a valid concern if there's a suspicion of infidelity. However, the author didn't have direct evidence and made a suggestion that led to a test. Frank took it seriously and then confronted Annie. The consequences are that Annie is now in a difficult position financially and socially, and the author is being blamed for the fallout.\n\nBut here's the thing: the author didn't have definitive proof. They acted on their feelings, which might have been valid, but maybe they should have given Frank more direct evidence or let him handle it without pushing. However, if the author had known, would they stay silent? The situation is complicated because they were close to both people and might have felt responsible, but their actions inadvertently caused harm.\n\nThe key here is whether the author overstepped. Suggesting a paternity test is a big step, and even if the author thought it was necessary, they might have acted without considering the potential fallout. Frank might have been blindsided, and the author's suggestion could be seen as inserting themselves into a private matter without the right to do so. However, if there were valid reasons to suspect infidelity, maybe the author was acting in Frank's best interest.\n\nBut since the author didn't have direct proof and the situation led to such a drastic outcome, they might be considered at fault for not letting Frank handle it on his own. The author might have been too quick to act on their suspicions. Alternatively, if Frank was already considering it, the author's suggestion just pushed him to take action. The problem is that the author's intervention caused a breakdown in the marriage, which is why people are blaming them.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because they acted on suspicions without concrete evidence, leading to the marriage's collapse. However, others might argue that the author was trying to help. But the question is whether they're in the wrong. Since they didn't have proof and the consequences were severe, the answer might lean towards A.\n"
