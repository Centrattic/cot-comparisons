It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for suggesting a paternity test to Frank, which led to him finding out his wife Annie was cheating.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is close to Annie, who's been Frank's wife for three years. Frank is in the oil industry, so he's away a lot. The author sensed something was off but didn't have direct proof. When the baby was on the way, the author, after a few beers, suggested a paternity test. This led Frank to get one, which confirmed the child wasn't his. Now Annie is without Frank's income and home, and the author is being blamed by family for ruining the marriage.\n\nThe key points are: the author acted on a suspicion without concrete evidence, used a moment when Frank was possibly less inhibited (after drinking) to plant the idea, and this led to the breakup. The author's family thinks they should've stayed silent, while the author believes Annie was at fault.\n\nI need to consider if the author overstepped. Did they have a right to interfere? They mention Annie \"created the situation,\" implying they think she's the bad guy. But the author didn't have proof, just a feeling. Suggesting a paternity test is a serious action with big consequences. Even if they suspected cheating, it's not their place to push Frank to take that step unless they had more evidence. The fact that it was after drinking might mean Frank wasn't fully in his right mind, so the author's comment could have been manipulative or taken advantage of a vulnerable moment.\n\nAlso, the author's motivation: they were close to Annie, so maybe they wanted to protect their friend Frank, thinking Annie was cheating. But acting on a suspicion without proof can lead to false accusations and damage relationships. The consequences are severe for all involved, especially the child. Even if Annie was cheating, the way the truth came out through the author's suggestion might be problematic.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author was trying to help Frank uncover the truth. But the method was questionable. The author might not have considered the impact of their words, especially since they weren't directly involved in Frank and Annie's marriage.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author might share some blame for bringing up the paternity test idea, even if it turned out to be true. It's a sensitive issue, and suggesting it without evidence can be seen as interfering. So, maybe the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they acted on suspicion without proof and caused the breakup, which affected everyone involved.\n"
