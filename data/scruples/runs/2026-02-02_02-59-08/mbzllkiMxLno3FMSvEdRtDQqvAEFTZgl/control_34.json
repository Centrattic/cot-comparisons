It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again to understand the details.\n\nThe author has known Annie since childhood, kind of like a sister. Annie married Frank, who works in the oil industry with a 14-day on, 14-day off schedule. For three years, Annie never directly admitted to infidelity, but the author sensed something. Then, when the couple announced a baby, the author, after some drinks, suggested Frank consider a paternity test. The comment stuck, and Frank insisted on one, which revealed the child wasn't his. He mentioned it was the author's suggestion, which led to a fallout. Now, Annie is losing her lifestyle, and the author is getting criticized by their family for ruining the marriage. The author feels that Annie created the situation and that using the child as an argument is unfair. They're both isolated and Frank is moving closer.\n\nFirst, I should consider the main points here. The author noticed signs of emotional cheating but didn't have concrete evidence. They made a suggestion to Frank in a casual setting, which he took seriously. The paternity test revealed the child wasn't his, leading to the marriage breakdown. The author is blamed for causing the separation, and family is upset. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, if Annie was indeed emotionally cheating, the author might have had concerns. However, the author didn't have proof and was just acting on a suspicion. The suggestion to take a paternity test could have been a way to uncover the truth, but it's a sensitive issue. The problem is that the author's suggestion led to the test, which Frank used as justification to end the marriage. But the root issue was Annie's infidelity, which she never directly admitted to. The author was in a position of trust as a close friend, so maybe they had a right to be concerned. However, without evidence, bringing up the idea might have been a breach of trust or gossiping. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might have been trying to protect Frank by encouraging him to seek the truth. Emotional cheating can be subtle, and if Annie was leading Frank on, the author's suggestion could have been a valid attempt to address the problem. But since the author didn't know for sure, did they overstep? Friends can sometimes make suggestions based on their observations, but in a situation where the couple is geographically separated, maybe the author should have approached it differently. \n\nAlso, the author is being criticized by their family for causing the breakup. The argument is that the child was harmed by the separation. However, the child's paternity is a different issue. If Annie cheated, the child's father is someone else, but the author's role in the discovery might not make them responsible for the emotional impact on the child. \n\nBut then again, maybe the author shouldn't have brought it up. Frank might have chosen to proceed with the test, but it's possible the marriage could have continued if the test wasn't done. The author's actions, though based on suspicion, directly led to the test, which changed everything. So, is the author wrong for making that suggestion? It's tricky. \n\nIn some cases, friends might feel they have a duty to speak up if they suspect something's wrong, even if they don't have proof. But this can backfire, especially if the suspicion is unfounded. The author might have acted out of concern, but without evidence, it's possible they crossed a line. \n\nAnother angle: the author's family is upset because they think the author shouldn't have interfered. The author's role as a friend to both Frank and Annie complicates things. If Annie was indeed the one at fault, then the author might not be in the wrong for trying to uncover the truth. But the suggestion was made in a social setting after drinking, which might not have been the best time. \n\nSo, considering all that, the key point is whether the author's suggestion was justified given the lack of direct evidence. If the author had no proof and was just acting on feelings, maybe they shouldn't have raised the issue. However, if they were making an educated guess based on their relationship with Annie and Frank, and their intention was to help, then perhaps it's not their fault. \n\nBut the fact that Annie didn't directly say anything might mean the author was overstepping. The problem is that the author's suggestion led to the test, which Frank used as a reason to leave. The author's family is now blaming them for the fallout. So, the author might be seen as the one who caused the conflict by intervening. \n\nHowever, if Annie was actually cheating, the author's action revealed the truth, even though it had consequences. The question is whether the author is responsible for the outcome. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the answer depends on whether the suggestion was an appropriate way to handle the situation. Since the author didn't have proof, maybe they shouldn't have suggested the test. But if they were sincere in their concern, maybe it's not their fault. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), because the author was trying to help Frank uncover the truth about his marriage, which Annie had been hiding. The real issue is Annie's infidelity, so the author isn't in the wrong for voicing their concern, even if it led to the test.\n"
