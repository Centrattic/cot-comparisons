It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the person who wrote this (the author) is in the wrong for supporting the cheated-on husband, Frank. The situation is that the author's sister figure, Annie, was having an affair, and the baby isn't Frank's. The author suggested a paternity test, which led to the discovery.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics here. The author has a close relationship with both Annie and Frank. The key points are: Annie cheated, possibly emotionally, and the author's comment about paternity led to the test. Now the author is getting blamed by family for ruining the marriage.\n\nThe author's argument is that Annie was the one who created the situation, so they're not wrong for speaking up. The family is saying the author shouldn't have said anything, and that the child is being used as an excuse. The author feels justified because they believed Annie was being unfaithful, even if it wasn't direct.\n\nBut wait, the author didn't have concrete evidence. They had a feeling based on Annie's behavior. Suggesting a paternity test might have been a way for Frank to confirm his suspicions. However, the author's suggestion was made after drinking, which might have been inappropriate. But the intention was to ensure the child was his, which could be seen as responsible.\n\nWas the author obligated to stay silent? If the author truly believed something was wrong and thought the paternity test would confirm it, maybe they weren't in the wrong. But they might have overstepped by making the suggestion, even if they were just trying to help. The outcome was a broken marriage and family estrangement, so the question is whether the author's role was to blame.\n\nOn the other hand, if the author didn't have proof and the marriage was already strained, maybe they shouldn't have intervened. The author might have thought they were helping Frank, but it's possible they didn't realize the full extent of the consequences. The family is upset because the marriage ended, and they see the author as the catalyst. But if Annie was indeed cheating, the author's action might have been justified in the long run.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It depends on whether they acted recklessly without enough evidence. The author might not have known for sure, but their intuition led them to ask. If Frank used the suggestion to confirm the infidelity, maybe the author's role was minor. However, the suggestion could have accelerated the breakup. In such cases, it's tricky because the person might not be at fault if they believed the spouse was cheating. But without clear evidence, making such a suggestion could be seen as meddling.\n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the author had a right to intervene. Since they were close friends, they might have thought they were helping. However, they might not have been in the position to make that suggestion, especially if it wasn't based on concrete facts. The fact that Frank later insisted on the test suggests that the author's comment was just a prompt, not the sole cause. So maybe the author isn't entirely at fault. But the family's reaction is also valid because the marriage ended, and they see the author as the cause.\n\nI'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because they tried to ensure the child's paternity, which is a valid concern. However, the way they approached it might have been inappropriate. But considering the outcome, it's a gray area. The answer could be B (No), but it's not black and white.\n"
