It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong for supporting the cheated-on husband, Frank. The situation involves Frank's wife, Annie, who had an affair and had a child with someone else. The author, who's like a sister to Annie, suggested a paternity test to Frank, which led to the discovery. Now, the author is getting criticized for ruining the marriage and is isolated.\n\nFirst, the author's intention with the suggestion. She had a suspicion that Annie was cheating, which turned out to be true. Her suggestion led to Frank getting a paternity test, which confirmed the infidelity. The key here is whether her action was justified. Since Annie had been emotionally cheating for years without directly admitting it, the author's concern wasn't out of nowhere. The author's role was to support her friend Frank, even though they hit it off quickly. \n\nBut wait, the author is close to Annie, so maybe she should have confronted Annie first before suggesting the test to Frank? That's a point. However, given the distance (1000 km away), maybe she couldn't do much. Frank himself ended up taking the suggestion seriously and doing the test, which led to the truth. \n\nThe author is being blamed for the divorce and the aftermath. But Annie's actions were the root cause. The author's intervention merely exposed the existing problem. The parents and siblings think she shouldn't have said anything, but it's also about accountability. Annie created the situation, not the author. \n\nThe author is defending her stance that Annie was responsible, which is fair. The question is about whether the author is in the wrong. Since she was trying to help Frank, who was being dishonest about the paternity, her action seems reasonable. However, maybe she overstepped by making the suggestion without confirming the suspicion. But the story says Annie never directly admitted to cheating; the author had a feeling. So, the author's role was to support the wronged husband, which is understandable. \n\nIn the end, the author isn't the one who committed the infidelity. The problem stems from Annie's actions. The author's suggestion led to the truth coming out, which is necessary in such situations. So, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
