It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who posted the story) is in the wrong. The situation involves Frank and Annie's marriage. The key points are:\n\n1. The author, who's close to Annie, had a feeling Annie was cheating but couldn't act on it due to distance.\n2. When Frank and Annie announced a pregnancy, the author, after drinking, suggested a paternity test. Frank later insisted on one, which revealed the child wasn't his.\n3. The author is now being criticized for \"ruining\" the marriage and causing Annie to lose her financial support and home.\n4. The author defends their actions, saying Annie created the situation and using the child as an excuse is unfair.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The author's intention was to help Frank verify paternity, which is a valid concern if infidelity is suspected. However, the method might be problematic. The author made the suggestion after alcohol, which could be seen as careless. Frank acted on it, leading to the breakdown of the marriage. \n\nAnnie's actions (cheating) are the root issue. The author's role was to voice a concern, but perhaps without the author's comment, Frank might not have pursued the test. However, Frank did later insist on the test, so he made the choice to act on it. \n\nThe author's family is criticizing them for overstepping, which is a common argument in such situations. The author is being blamed for consequences beyond their control. But Annie's actions were wrong, so the author's support for Frank might be justified. \n\nIs the author at fault? They weren't the one cheating, but their comment might have triggered events. However, the responsibility lies more with Frank for acting on the suggestion and Annie for her infidelity. The author's role was minimal compared to the other parties. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, people often focus on intent and direct causation. The author didn't force Frank to get the test; he made that decision. So the author isn't the main wrongdoer here. They had a valid concern and expressed it, even if it was under the influence. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
