It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the AITA story) is in the wrong. The scenario is about Frank and Annie, where Annie cheated, and the author, who's a close friend, suggested a paternity test after the couple already had a child. The author's family is upset, thinking they shouldn't have said anything, while the author believes Annie was at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The author mentions that Annie never directly admitted to cheating; it was more of a feeling. Then, after the baby was born, the author suggested a paternity test, which led to Frank finding out it wasn't his. The author is now being blamed for ruining the marriage.\n\nIs the author wrong here? Well, maybe. The key points to consider: the author had a suspicion based on their closeness to both Frank and Annie. But the author's role is as a friend, and they might have acted out of concern for Frank. However, suggesting a paternity test is a big step, especially without more concrete evidence. If Annie was emotionally cheating (as mentioned), maybe the author could have encouraged Frank to confront her directly instead of suggesting a test. Also, the author was not in a position to know for sure, so their intervention might have been premature.\n\nOn the other hand, Annie's actions were unethical and betrayed Frank's trust. The author might have felt it was necessary to protect Frank from being a biological father to a child that isn't his. But the method of intervention\u2014bringing it up after drinking\u2014might have been unwise. Also, the author's family is upset because they see it as overstepping. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? It's a bit nuanced. If the author acted without clear evidence, they might be overstepping. But if they had a valid suspicion and the test revealed the truth, maybe they did the right thing. However, the way they approached it could be problematic. Since the question is whether they are in the wrong, considering the lack of direct evidence and the impact on their family, the answer might lean towards A (Yes). But some might argue B (No) because the cheating was real. But traditionally, AITA stories often side with the person who intervened, but here, the intervention might be seen as meddling. Hmm.\n"
