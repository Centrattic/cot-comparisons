It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves Frank and Annie, where Annie cheated on Frank, and the author suggested a paternity test. The author's family is upset because they think the author shouldn't have said anything, leading to Frank finding out and the marriage breaking down.\n\nFirst, the author claims that Annie cheated, but the problem is that the author didn't have direct evidence. They just had a feeling. So the author made a suggestion based on suspicion. That's risky because accusing someone without proof can be harmful. The author's suggestion led to Frank getting a paternity test, which confirmed the suspicion. Now, the author is being blamed for ruining the marriage.\n\nThe key points here are: Did the author have a right to make that suggestion? Was it their place to bring up the paternity test? The author and Annie have a close relationship, like family, so maybe they felt they could say things others wouldn't. But even in close relationships, bringing up such a sensitive topic without proof could be seen as crossing a line. The author might have acted out of concern, but they didn't have evidence. If the author was just trying to help, maybe they should have approached it differently, maybe privately and with more evidence, or encouraged Frank to communicate with Annie first.\n\nAlso, the author's family is criticizing them for causing the breakdown. The author's reasoning is that Annie created the situation, so the author isn't at fault. But maybe the author's intervention was unnecessary. Cheating is a major issue, but the author's role here is complicated. If the author had no proof and just acted on suspicion, that could be seen as meddling. However, if the author had reasons to believe Annie was cheating, maybe they were trying to protect Frank. The line between helping and interfering is blurry here.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the cheater is Annie, but the author's action was the catalyst for the discovery. The author might feel justified, but their action could have been premature. The author's family's criticism is about keeping quiet, which is a common stance in some families. However, the author's intent was to ensure the child's paternity, which is a legitimate concern. But the method of confronting the issue without evidence might be where the author is in the wrong.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author's suggestion led to the breakup, and they might be at fault for not having proof. However, the main issue was Annie's infidelity. The author's role is a gray area. If the answer is A, then the author is in the wrong for acting on suspicion. If B, then the author isn't wrong because they were trying to help. I think it's a bit of both, but since the question is binary, I have to choose. The author's action was based on suspicion, which might not be enough. Therefore, the author is in the wrong, answer A.\n"
