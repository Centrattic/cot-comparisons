It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story (AITA) is in the wrong for supporting the cheated-on husband. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, Frank and Annie got married. Frank was away a lot for work, 14 days on and off. The author, who's close to Annie like a sister, had suspicions that Annie was cheating but didn't have direct evidence. Then when they found out Annie was pregnant, the author, after drinking, suggested a paternity test. Frank took that suggestion seriously, and it turned out the baby wasn't his. The author's comment led to the test that exposed the infidelity. Now, Annie is without Frank's income and home, moving back with her parents. The author is being criticized by family for causing the breakdown of the marriage. The author defends themselves by saying Annie created the situation and that using the child as an excuse is unfair. Both the author and Frank are now isolated from their friends and family.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider the key points. The author didn't know for sure Annie was cheating; it was a suspicion. The suggestion of a paternity test was made in a casual conversation after drinking. The author might not have intended for Frank to act on it immediately, but his taking the suggestion seriously led to the test. The test revealed the infidelity. The author's parents and siblings think they should have stayed silent. The author believes they did the right thing by speaking up.\n\nPossible angles: Did the author overstep by bringing up the paternity test? The author's relationship with Annie is close, but they live far away. They didn't have concrete evidence, just a feeling. By suggesting the test, the author might have acted on a suspicion without proof, which could be seen as harmful. However, if Annie was indeed cheating, then the author's action led to Frank finding out the truth. The author might be seen as a friend trying to help Frank, but perhaps in a tactless way.\n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't know about the affair firsthand; it was just a suspicion. The test result showed the baby wasn't Frank's, confirming the infidelity. The author's comment was a catalyst for Frank to get the test done. But maybe the author shouldn't have brought it up without more evidence. The author's family might think they meddled too much. However, the author's intention was to prevent Frank from being a father to someone else's child. \n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, if the author made a comment that indirectly caused the breakdown of the marriage, even if it was true, is the author to blame? Or is Annie responsible for her actions? The author might not be at fault because they were trying to help Frank uncover the truth. However, the method of doing so (suggesting a paternity test after drinking) could be seen as meddling without evidence. \n\nBut since the test confirmed the infidelity, perhaps the author was right to speak up. The question is whether it's the author's responsibility to intervene. Since the author is close to Annie, maybe they should have handled it differently, like talking to Annie first. But they didn't have proof. So, the answer could be B (Not in the wrong) because the author's action led to Frank finding out a truth that Annie had kept hidden. However, the way it was done might be questionable, but the outcome was revealing infidelity. Alternatively, maybe A (in the wrong) because the author acted on suspicion without evidence, causing harm.\n\nIt's tricky. The key is whether the author's action was a reasonable way to express their suspicion. Since they had a close relationship but no proof, suggesting a paternity test might not be the best approach. However, the result was necessary for Frank to know the truth. The author might not be in the wrong because they were trying to help Frank avoid being cheated on. So the answer might be B.\n"
