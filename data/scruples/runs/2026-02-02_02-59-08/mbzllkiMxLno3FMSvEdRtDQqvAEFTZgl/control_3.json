It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for supporting the cheated-on husband by suggesting a paternity test. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author's sister figure, Annie, married Frank, who's in the oil industry with a 14-day work schedule. The author suspected Annie was cheating but didn't have proof. When Annie got pregnant, the author suggested a paternity test to Frank, which led to the discovery that the child wasn't his. Now, the author is being criticized for causing the marriage breakdown and is facing backlash from family.\n\nThe key points here are the author's intent and the outcome. The author's concern was about Frank's paternity, which is a valid concern if there's a possibility of infidelity. However, the author didn't have concrete evidence of Annie's cheating, only a feeling. By suggesting the paternity test, the author might have acted on suspicion without proof, which could be seen as overstepping. \n\nBut on the other hand, if Annie was emotionally cheating and the child isn't Frank's, the author's concern might have been justified. However, the author's role here is as a friend, not a decision-maker. The fact that the author's suggestion led directly to the test, which then caused the breakup, might make them a catalyst. \n\nBut was it the author's place to push for the test? Even if Annie was unfaithful, the author might not have the right to interfere in Frank's marriage unless he was directly involved. The author's motivation was to protect Frank, but the method of intervention could be problematic. The author might be in the wrong for not letting Frank handle it himself or for not having enough evidence before suggesting the test. \n\nHowever, considering that the marriage was already strained due to Annie's possible infidelity, the author's suggestion could be seen as helping Frank uncover the truth. The backlash from family might be because they think the author meddled too much. \n\nIn conclusion, the author's actions were based on suspicion without proof, leading to a significant consequence. While the intention was to help Frank, the means might not be justified. So the answer might be A (author is in the wrong), but there's nuance here. Alternatively, if the marriage was already broken, the author's role in exposing it could be justified. It's a tough call, but leaning towards A because the author didn't have direct evidence and their intervention caused the breakup.\n"
