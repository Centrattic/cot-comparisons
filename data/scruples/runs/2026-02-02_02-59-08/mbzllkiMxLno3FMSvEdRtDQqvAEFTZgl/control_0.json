It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a friend, Annie, who married Frank, who works in the oil industry with a 14-day on, 14-day off schedule. The author, who's close to Annie like a sister, suspected that Annie might be cheating because Frank was away a lot. Then when Annie got pregnant, the author asked Frank if he was thinking about a paternity test after some beers. Frank took the suggestion seriously and got a test, which showed the kid wasn't his. Now Annie is without her husband's income and home, moving back in with her parents. The author is getting criticized for \"ruining the marriage\" and is defending themselves by saying Annie created the situation, and using the child as an excuse is unfair. Both the author and Frank are isolated from family and friends.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Let me break it down. The key points here are the author's intent and actions. The author suspected infidelity but didn't have proof. They didn't confront Annie directly but instead told Frank, albeit in a casual setting after drinking. Frank then took the suggestion and acted on it. The result was the discovery of the affair, leading to the breakup.\n\nFirst, the author's motivation. They had a close relationship with Annie, so maybe their concern was genuine. But how did they go about it? The author didn't approach Annie first to confirm if there was an issue. Instead, they mentioned it to Frank in a way that might not have been the best timing (after drinking). However, Frank later used the author's suggestion as a catalyst for getting the paternity test. The question is whether the author overstepped by bringing up the idea to Frank.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, if Annie was indeed cheating, the author might have a point in wanting the truth. But the method of addressing it is questionable. The author didn't have concrete evidence, just a feeling. Telling Frank, even indirectly, could be seen as interfering in the marriage. However, considering the context\u2014Annie's husband was away a lot, and the author had a close relationship with both parties\u2014maybe they felt compelled to act on their suspicions.\n\nNow, the aftermath: Annie is now without financial support and a home. The author is blamed for ruining the marriage. The author argues that Annie was at fault. The user is asking if the author is wrong.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author's action was the suggestion of a paternity test. But the final decision to take the test was Frank's. The author might not be entirely at fault because they were concerned about infidelity and wanted the truth. However, they could have approached the situation differently, maybe by confronting Annie first or advising Frank in a more serious, sober conversation.\n\nAnother angle: The author didn't know for sure if Annie was cheating; they just had a feeling. Acting on a suspicion without proof can be problematic. The child aspect is brought up by others as a reason to criticize the author, but the author is countering that Annie is the one responsible for the affair. The author's support for Frank after the cheating is revealed might be seen as justified if Frank was the wronged party.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author's actions might not be entirely in the wrong. They acted on a suspicion to seek the truth, which led to the exposure of infidelity. However, the method of doing so\u2014telling Frank without confronting Annie first\u2014could be seen as meddling. But given that the marriage was already in trouble due to Annie's actions, the author might not be at fault. The key is that the root issue is Annie's infidelity, not the author's suggestion. Therefore, the answer might be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
