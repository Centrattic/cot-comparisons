It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves Frank, who was cheated on by his wife Annie, and the author who supported Frank. The key points here are the author's role in suggesting a paternity test, which led to the discovery of the infidelity and subsequent fallout.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that they had a feeling something was off but weren't sure. They were close friends with Annie, who is more like a sister to them. When the child was born, the author, after some drinks, mentioned the possibility of a paternity test. Frank later acted on that suggestion, leading to the discovery that he wasn't the father. Now the author is being criticized by their family for causing the breakup.\n\nThe user wants to know if the author is in the wrong. Let's consider the ethical aspects. The author didn't have direct evidence of infidelity but acted on a suspicion. They didn't out Annie publicly but made a private comment to Frank. Frank, in turn, decided to take action based on that suggestion. The author's intention might have been to help Frank uncover the truth if there was a problem, but it backfired.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, was it right to suggest the paternity test? If Annie was indeed cheating, Frank had a right to know. However, the author didn't have concrete proof, just a feeling. Their suggestion might have been based on intuition, but it's possible they overstepped by influencing a decision that could ruin a marriage. On the other hand, if Annie was lying about the child's paternity, the author's action helped Frank discover the truth, which could be seen as necessary for his well-being.\n\nAnother angle is the impact on the child. The author argues that Annie created the situation, but the child is innocent. The author might be right in thinking that Annie was at fault, but the way the situation was handled (public shaming, causing Frank to be isolated) could be seen as harsh. The author's family is blaming them for speaking up, which is a common reaction in such scenarios.\n\nConsidering all this, the author's action was a difficult but well-intentioned one. They didn't have malicious intent, just a concern for their friend's well-being. Even though the outcome was negative, the suggestion of the test was a private matter between Frank and Annie. The author might not be in the wrong because they acted on a suspicion to help a friend, even if it led to unintended consequences. However, the lack of evidence could mean they overstepped in a personal matter.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's intentions were good, and while the outcome was messy, they might not be in the wrong. The answer would be B (No).\n"
