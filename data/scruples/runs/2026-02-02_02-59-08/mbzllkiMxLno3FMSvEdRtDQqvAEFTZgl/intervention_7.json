It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about Frank and Annie's marriage. The author is a close friend of Annie, almost like a sister. Frank was cheating, but the twist here is that Annie was the one who was unfaithful. The author found out that Annie's child isn't Frank's and suggested a paternity test.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. The author didn't know for sure that Annie was cheating; they just had a feeling. They lived far away, so they couldn't intervene much. When the baby was born, the author, after some beers, suggested a paternity test. Frank took it seriously, did the test, and it turned out the kid wasn't his. Now, Frank is isolated, and the author is getting criticized for causing the breakdown.\n\nThe question is whether the author is at fault. On one hand, the author might have acted out of concern for Frank, thinking he deserved to know the truth. On the other hand, they might have overstepped by suggesting the test without being certain. But if Annie was emotionally cheating and leading Frank on, the author's concern might be valid. However, the author didn't have concrete proof. Maybe the author's suggestion was based on suspicion, which led to the test. Even though the author's intention was to help, the outcome was damaging. But Annie was the one who had the affair and lied. The author's role was to point out Frank's right to know the truth. So, maybe the author isn't in the wrong because they were trying to help Frank discover the truth that Annie had hidden. But the way they approached it\u2014maybe after drinking\u2014could be seen as careless. However, the main responsibility lies with Annie for the infidelity and deceit. The author's action led to the truth coming out, which might be necessary even if it caused pain. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
