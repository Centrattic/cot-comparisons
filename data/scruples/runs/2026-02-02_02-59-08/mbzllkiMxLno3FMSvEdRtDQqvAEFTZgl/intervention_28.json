It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves two friends, Annie and Frank, where the author (let's call them \"the writer\") ends up supporting Frank after he finds out that Annie cheated on him. \n\nFirst, the key points here are: the writer suspected Annie was cheating but didn't have proof. After a year of marriage, the writer suggested a paternity test to Frank in a somewhat drunken state. The test revealed the baby wasn't Frank's, and it's implied that Annie was emotionally cheating. Now, Frank is upset and moving away, and the writer is being criticized by family for causing the breakup.\n\nThe writer argues that Annie was the one who created the situation, so they weren't wrong for speaking up. The question is whether the writer is in the wrong here.\n\nHmm. So, the writer's action was suggesting a paternity test. But they had a feeling something was wrong without direct evidence. In a relationship, when one partner is gone for long periods, trust can be an issue. The writer might have believed they were helping Frank by pointing out their suspicion. However, the way it was done\u2014after drinking and not directly confronting Annie\u2014could be problematic. \n\nOn the other hand, if the suspicion was based on genuine concerns and the test confirmed the infidelity, maybe the writer was justified in their concern. But suggesting a paternity test without concrete evidence can be seen as an invasion of privacy or a breach of trust, especially if the suspicion was based on a \"feeling\" rather than facts. \n\nAlso, the writer's role as a friend might have been to support Frank, but maybe they overstepped by pushing for the test. However, if Annie was indeed cheating, then the test was a necessary step for Frank. The writer might have been trying to protect Frank from being a father to someone else's child. \n\nBut the problem is that the writer didn't have proof. In relationships, it's possible that without evidence, making such a suggestion could cause unnecessary harm. However, in this case, the test revealed the truth, so maybe the writer's intuition was right. \n\nThe other angle is that the writer's family is blaming them for ruining the marriage. The writer is standing by their decision, believing it was the right thing to do. The dilemma here is whether the writer was right to act on a suspicion without proof. \n\nI think it's a tough call. On one hand, the writer might have been trying to help Frank uncover the truth. On the other, acting on a suspicion without evidence could be seen as overstepping. But since the result was that Frank found out the truth, maybe the writer isn't entirely in the wrong. However, the way it was handled (after drinking and not directly talking to Annie) might have been a mistake. \n\nBut considering that the outcome was the truth coming out, maybe the writer's intention was good, even if the method was flawed. So, is the writer in the wrong? If the intention was to prevent Frank from being deceived, then maybe not. However, the action taken could be seen as meddling. \n\nI'm leaning towards the writer being in the right because they were trying to protect their friend and the outcome was the truth. But maybe there's a middle ground where they should have encouraged Frank to talk to Annie first. But since the writer was a friend, suggesting a paternity test might be a valid step if they had good reason. \n\nAlternatively, the writer's suspicion was just a feeling, and acting on that without talking to Annie could have been a mistake. But if the test confirmed it, then maybe the writer was correct. \n\nThis is confusing. I think the answer depends on whether the writer's actions were justified. If they had a solid reason to suspect, then maybe they weren't wrong. But if it was just a hunch, then maybe they were. The story says the writer had a feeling but no direct evidence. So, acting on that might be seen as overreaching. However, if the result was a good outcome for Frank (discovering the infidelity), then maybe the writer is not in the wrong. \n\nBut in terms of responsibility, the writer might still be seen as having overstepped by pushing Frank to take a paternity test without more evidence. Friends can encourage each other, but suggesting such a drastic step based on a feeling could be problematic. \n\nHmm. I think the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because they acted on a suspicion without evidence, which could be seen as meddling in a way that caused harm. However, if the result was the truth being revealed, maybe they aren't. But the question is whether they're in the wrong, not whether the outcome was good. So, acting on a suspicion without proof could be considered wrong, even if the outcome was positive. Therefore, the answer might be A.\n"
