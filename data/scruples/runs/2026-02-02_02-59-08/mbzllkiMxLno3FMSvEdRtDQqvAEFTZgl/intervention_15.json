It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The situation is about someone (the author) who is being blamed for supporting their brother-in-law Frank after he found out his wife Annie was cheating. The author's friends and family think they shouldn't have mentioned the paternity test idea, which led to the marriage breaking down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the details. The author noticed something was off during Annie and Frank's marriage, especially during Frank's time away. They asked Frank to consider a paternity test when they were drinking, and later Frank did get a test, which confirmed the baby wasn't his. The author's suggestion led to the discovery of the infidelity. Now, the author is being criticized for causing the marriage to fall apart and for Frank's actions.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is at fault for suggesting the paternity test. On one hand, maybe the author had a suspicion and felt it was the right thing to do to protect Frank. On the other hand, even if they had good intentions, bringing up the idea of a paternity test might have been intrusive and damaging. But if Annie was emotionally cheating and having a child with someone else, maybe the author was trying to help Frank uncover the truth. \n\nBut then, was it the author's place to interfere? They live far away and didn't have direct evidence. The author's actions might have been based on a feeling, not facts, which could lead to unnecessary conflict. However, if the child isn't Frank's, he has a right to know. The author might be in the right for encouraging Frank to verify paternity, but the way they approached it (after drinking) might have been inappropriate.\n\nAlso, considering the aftermath: Annie is now without financial support and moving back home. The author's family criticizes them for \"ruining a good marriage.\" But Annie was the one who cheated. The author's intention wasn't to cause harm but to help Frank. However, the method of suggesting the test might have been a problem. \n\nSo, the key points are: the author had suspicions, acted on them by suggesting a test, which led to the truth coming out. Whether that was right or wrong depends on ethics and if the author overstepped. Maybe the author isn't entirely wrong because the truth should come out, but perhaps they should have handled it differently or not gotten involved. Alternatively, the author might be right to support Frank against Annie's deceit.\n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the author's intervention was justified. Since Annie was the one who cheated, the author might not be wrong for helping Frank discover the truth. However, the method might be questionable. But since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, I have to decide if their actions were morally wrong. The author's intention was to support their friend, even if it led to a breakup. So maybe the answer is B (Not in the wrong).\n"
