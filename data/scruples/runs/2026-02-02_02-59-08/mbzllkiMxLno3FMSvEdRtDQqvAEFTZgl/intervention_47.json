It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong here. The situation is about a friend's sister, Annie, who was married to Frank. The author suspected that Annie was cheating and that the baby might not be Frank's. The author, after a few beers, suggested a paternity test to Frank. It turns out the kid wasn't his, and now Frank is upset, and the author is getting blamed by family for ruining the marriage.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author's main action was suggesting the paternity test. But how did they get there? They had a feeling Annie was cheating but didn't have concrete proof. The author didn't know for sure, just a suspicion. Then, after drinking, they made a comment that led Frank to push for a test. The result confirmed the suspicion. Now, the author is facing backlash from family for causing the breakdown.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, they might be seen as overstepping. They weren't part of Frank and Annie's marriage, just a friend. Maybe they shouldn't have pushed for a test based on a hunch. On the other hand, the author might think they were doing the right thing by helping Frank discover the truth, especially if Annie was being dishonest.\n\nBut wait, Frank had his own doubts. The author's suggestion prompted him to act. But did the author have the right to make that comment? If Annie was lying, maybe the author was trying to protect Frank. But without proof, it's a risky move. The author's parents and siblings are upset because they think the author shouldn't have meddled. Also, the child is being brought into it as a reason to not speak out. But the author argues that Annie created the situation.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author's intention was to help a friend uncover the truth. However, the method\u2014making a suggestion under the influence of alcohol\u2014might have been inappropriate. Even if the suspicion was right, the way it was handled could be seen as overstepping. The author wasn't in a position to act as a judge, and the consequences were severe. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because they intervened without certainty, leading to a broken marriage and personal consequences. So the answer would be A.\n"
