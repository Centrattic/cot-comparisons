It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The situation involves Frank and Annie, where Annie cheated on Frank, and the author, who's close to both, suggested a paternity test which led to the discovery that the child isn't Frank's. Now, the author is being blamed by family and friends for ruining the marriage, and they're defending themselves by saying Annie was the one who caused the situation.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author is Annie's sister-like figure. Frank was cheating on the job, 14 days on, 14 off, so maybe he wasn't around much. Annie never directly admitted to cheating, but the author had suspicions. Then, when there was a pregnancy, the author, after drinking, suggested a paternity test. Frank took the suggestion seriously, did the test, and found out he wasn't the father. Now, Annie is without Frank's income and home, moving back in with her parents. The author is being criticized by their family for speaking up, and the author is standing by their decision, saying Annie was the one who created the problem.\n\nSo the question is, is the author in the wrong? The author's defense is that Annie was the cheater, but the author is being blamed for causing the breakup. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants others' opinions.\n\nLet me consider the roles. The author didn't have direct evidence but had a feeling. They made a comment after drinking, which Frank then acted on. The problem here is whether the author overstepped by suggesting the test. Cheating is a serious issue, but the author didn't have proof. By suggesting the test, they might have acted on a suspicion without evidence, leading to the breakup. However, the author's intention was to help Frank, thinking there might be infidelity. On the other hand, maybe the author shouldn't have intervened without being certain.\n\nBut Annie was the one who was cheating. If the author had valid reasons to suspect her, even if not certain, maybe their intention was good. However, the method of confronting the issue by suggesting a test might have been harsh. Also, the author is now being blamed for the fallout, which complicates things.\n\nIn some perspectives, the author tried to help a friend (Frank) by pointing out a problem they noticed, even if indirectly. But in others, maybe the author shouldn't have meddled in someone else's marriage without concrete evidence. The line between helping and interfering is thin here.\n\nThe author's family is attacking them for ruining the marriage, but the marriage was already in trouble due to Annie's actions. The author's comment was the catalyst for Frank to take action, but it was Annie's behavior that caused the problem in the first place. So maybe the author isn't entirely at fault. However, the author might have acted recklessly without proof, leading to public shaming or the breakup.\n\nBut considering that the child isn't Frank's, it's a significant issue. If Frank had continued the marriage without knowing, it could have led to bigger problems down the line. So maybe the author did the right thing by bringing it up, even if it was a difficult situation. However, the method and timing (after drinking) might have been unwise.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, while Annie is the one who cheated, the author's action directly led to the paternity test and the subsequent breakdown. But the root cause is Annie's infidelity. The author's role is more of a catalyst, but not the sole cause. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong, but had good intentions, even if their approach was flawed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the author should have kept their mouth shut, as they didn't have proof, and it's not their place to meddle. So the answer could swing either way. But given that the user thinks the author is wrong, maybe the answer is A. But I'm not sure. Let me think again.\n\nIn the end, the author acted on a suspicion without evidence, which led to the marriage ending. While Annie was at fault for cheating, the author's intervention caused direct consequences. But maybe the author was justified in trying to help a friend. However, the author's family is right in a way that they shouldn't have interfered. But it's a complex situation where both parties have issues. The user's question is whether the author is in the wrong. Considering the situation, the author made a suggestion that led to the breakup, but the marriage was already problematic. So perhaps the author isn't entirely wrong. But maybe they are partially at fault. But the answer needs to be A or B. The user says they think the author is wrong. But I might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because the author was trying to help and Annie was the cheater. However, the method could be questioned. But in the end, the main issue was Annie's infidelity, so the author's role is mitigated. So answer B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
