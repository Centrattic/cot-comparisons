It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA story is in the wrong for supporting the cheated-on husband. The story involves Frank, who discovered through a paternity test that his wife Annie had an affair, leading to the breakdown of their marriage. The author, who's close to both, suggested the paternity test after drinking, and now feels blamed for ruining the marriage.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. Annie had an affair, and the child isn't Frank's. The author's suggestion of a paternity test led to the discovery. People are blaming the author for speaking up. The author defends their position, saying Annie created the situation and using the child as an excuse is unfair.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, the author is supporting Frank, who was the wronged party. The author's action was bringing up the paternity test, which, while it led to the breakup, was based on a suspicion that Annie was cheating. If Annie was indeed unfaithful and the child isn't Frank's, then the author's action might be seen as just trying to help Frank uncover the truth. However, the author did this in a casual setting after some drinks, which might have been insensitive. But the core issue is that Annie cheated, and the author's suggestion led to the truth coming out. It's a tough spot because the author is being blamed for something they tried to help with. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author overstepped by suggesting the test. But given that Frank later insisted on it, the author's role might have been just the catalyst. The real fault lies with Annie for the affair. The author isn't the one who cheated; they're the one who brought attention to the problem. However, the way they approached it could be questioned. But in terms of right or wrong, the author's intention was to help Frank. So perhaps the answer is B (not in the wrong), as the author is supporting the wronged party and the real issue is the spouse's infidelity.\n"
