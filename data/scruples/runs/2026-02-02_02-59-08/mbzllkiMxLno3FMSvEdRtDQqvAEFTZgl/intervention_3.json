It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author (the person who posted the story) is in the wrong. The situation is about a friend, Annie, who cheated on her husband Frank, and the author suggested a paternity test that led to the discovery of the infidelity.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author had a close relationship with Annie since childhood and was like a sister to them. Frank works in the oil industry with a 14-day on/off schedule. The author had a suspicion that Annie was cheating but didn't have concrete proof. When Frank found out about the affair (through emotional cheating and the paternity test), the marriage fell apart. The author is now being criticized by family for causing the breakdown.\n\nThe main question is whether the author is at fault. The author's intention was to suggest a paternity test because they had a feeling something wasn't right. But the test revealed the child wasn't Frank's, leading to the marriage ending. The author is being blamed by family for not staying silent and for causing the marriage to end.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. On one hand, the author didn't have direct evidence and might have acted on a suspicion. They mentioned it in a casual setting (after beers), which might not have been the best approach. However, the author's concern was genuine, and they might have thought it was necessary to protect Frank from a potential lie.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might have overstepped. Suggesting a paternity test without concrete evidence could be seen as meddling in Frank's marriage. Even though they had a close relationship, the author's role in causing the marriage to end could be problematic. However, Annie's infidelity is the root cause. The author's suggestion was the catalyst, but the underlying issue was Annie's actions.\n\nThe family is blaming the author for the fallout, but it's possible that the marriage was already in trouble due to the infidelity. The author might not be entirely at fault since they were trying to help Frank discover the truth. However, their method of bringing it up might have been inappropriate.\n\nIn AITA (Am I the Asshole) contexts, the judgment often depends on whether the person acted with malicious intent. Here, the author didn't have malicious intent; they were concerned. However, the way they brought it up could be seen as intrusive. But since Annie was emotionally cheating, Frank already had reasons to suspect something. The author's suggestion might have just pushed Frank to confront the truth he was already aware of.\n\nConsidering all this, it's a bit of a gray area. However, the author might not be entirely at fault because the cheating was the root problem. But they did play a role in exposing it, which led to the marriage ending. So, depending on perspective, some might say the author is at fault for intervening, while others might see it as a necessary action given the circumstances.\n"
