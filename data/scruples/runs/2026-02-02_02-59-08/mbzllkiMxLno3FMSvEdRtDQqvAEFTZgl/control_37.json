It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me break down the situation. The author is friends with Annie and Frank. Frank works in oil, so he's away a lot. The author suspected Annie was cheating but didn't have proof. Then when Annie gets pregnant, the author suggests a paternity test to Frank, which leads to the discovery that the baby isn't his. Now Frank and Annie are broken up, Annie is struggling financially, and the author is being blamed by their families.\n\nFirst, the author's intention was to help Frank, right? They thought Annie might be cheating based on their long-term friendship and the signs they noticed. But did they have the right to bring up the paternity test? The author was concerned about the child's paternity, which is a valid concern if there's infidelity. But since the author wasn't directly told by Annie, maybe they overstepped by pushing Frank to get the test. Even though the author had a feeling, they didn't have concrete evidence. \n\nHowever, Frank ended up getting the test because of the author's suggestion, and it turned out the baby wasn't his. So the author's action led to the breakup and Annie's current situation. But was it the author's fault? The question is whether they were wrong to say something. On one hand, they were trying to prevent Frank from being a father to someone else's child. On the other hand, they might have acted without enough proof, which could have been hurtful.\n\nAlso, the author's family is judging them for ruining the marriage. Is it fair? The author's role was as a friend, so maybe they were trying to help. But did they have the right to interfere? If Annie was indeed cheating, then the author's action might have been justified. But since it's a friend's sister, maybe the author should have stayed out of it. \n\nAnother angle: the author's suspicion wasn't confirmed. They brought up the paternity test idea after drinking, which might not have been the best approach. However, the test revealed the truth, which Frank might have found out later anyway. The author's action might have been necessary, even if it caused conflict. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a tough call. If the author acted out of concern and the result was the truth coming out, maybe they're not wrong. But if they acted without solid evidence and caused harm, they might be. The key is whether the author's action was the right thing to do, regardless of the consequences. Since the author's intention was to help Frank, and the outcome was the truth, maybe they're not in the wrong. But the method of bringing it up might have been hasty. But overall, I think the author isn't in the wrong because they were trying to protect Frank from a potential larger problem.\n"
