It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post) is in the wrong. The situation involves Frank and Annie's marriage, where the author (let's call them Alex) suggested a paternity test that ended up revealing Frank wasn't the father. Now, there's a fallout, and Alex is being criticized.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the details. Alex is close to Annie, almost like a sister. Frank works in the oil industry with a 14-day on, 14-day off schedule. Over three years, Annie didn't directly admit to cheating, but Alex had suspicions. When they found out Annie was pregnant, Alex, during a drunk moment, suggested a paternity test. Frank took the suggestion seriously, got a test, and it turned out the baby wasn't his. Now, Annie is without Frank's income and moving back with her parents. Alex is being blamed by family for ruining the marriage, and there's a lot of isolation going on.\n\nSo, the question is whether Alex is in the wrong. The user thinks Alex is in the wrong but wants others' opinions. The possible answers are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nLet me think about the key points. Was Alex justified in bringing up the paternity test? The story says Annie never directly said she was cheating, but Alex had a feeling. However, infidelity is a serious matter, and without concrete evidence, Alex's suggestion might be seen as crossing a boundary. The fact that Alex was drunk when making the suggestion could be a factor\u2014maybe they weren't in their right mind. But even so, the suggestion led to Frank getting a test, which revealed the truth. \n\nOn the other hand, if Annie was indeed cheating, maybe the marriage was doomed, and Alex's suggestion just exposed the problem. But the problem is that Alex might have acted without having evidence, perhaps based on their own suspicions. The question is whether Alex had the right to interfere in their friends' marriage like that. \n\nAlso, the aftermath: Annie is now in a worse position financially and has to move back with her parents. The family is blaming Alex for causing the breakup. Is that fair? If Annie was cheating, maybe Frank should have noticed or addressed it earlier. But Alex's role was just suggesting the test. The challenge is whether that suggestion was an overstep.\n\nAnother angle: The author's relationship with Annie. Since they're as close as siblings, maybe Alex felt it was their place to intervene. But even so, suggesting a paternity test is a huge step. It could be seen as meddling. The fact that they were drunk when making the suggestion might indicate that it was a careless comment that shouldn't have been made.\n\nIn terms of ethical considerations, maybe Alex had no right to push for a paternity test unless there was clear evidence. Annie and Frank were married, so Frank should have been the one to address his suspicions, not Alex. By suggesting the test, Alex might have been overstepping their role as a friend. \n\nHowever, if the marriage was already in trouble due to Annie's infidelity, then maybe the test was inevitable. The fact that Frank ended up finding out and taking the test shows that the marriage had issues. But does that absolve Alex? Probably not. The suggestion from a third party, especially a friend of the other spouse, could be seen as taking sides and causing unnecessary harm.\n\nAlso, the part about emotional cheating is mentioned. Frank \"caught her emotional cheating,\" which might mean that there was some emotional infidelity before the physical. If that's the case, then maybe Frank had reasons to be suspicious, and the test was a way to confirm his fears. But again, it was Alex who suggested it, which might have been the catalyst.\n\nIn the end, whether Alex is in the wrong depends on whether they had the right to interfere. Suggesting a paternity test is a major action that can destroy a marriage. Even if there were suspicions, a friend shouldn't be the one pushing for such a test without being asked. So, maybe Alex is at fault for intervening in a way that's not their place. Therefore, the answer might be A (yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
