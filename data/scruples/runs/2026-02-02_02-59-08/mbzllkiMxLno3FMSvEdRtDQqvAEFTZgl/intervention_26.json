It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the AITA post) is in the wrong for supporting the cheated-on husband, Frank, after the situation unfolded.\n\nFirst, the author's role in the story. They knew Annie since childhood and were close, almost like a sibling. When they learned Frank's child wasn't his, the author suggested a paternity test after some drinking. That led to the test confirming the child wasn't Frank's. Now, Annie is without Frank's income and moving back in with her parents. The author is being criticized by their family for ruining the marriage and is defending their actions by saying Annie created the situation.\n\nSo, the key points here are: Did the author have a right to suggest the paternity test? Was their intervention justified? The author's intention was to help Frank figure out the truth, but their suggestion was taken seriously by Frank, leading to the marriage breakdown. However, the author didn't have concrete evidence of cheating; they just had a feeling. They also didn't confront Annie directly but talked to Frank. \n\nAnnie had been married for three years and didn't openly admit to cheating. The author's comment was made in a casual setting (after beers), which might make it seem like a joke or offhand remark, but it still had serious consequences. The author's family is upset because they think the author should have stayed out of it. \n\nEthically, the author might be in the wrong if their suggestion was based on suspicion without evidence. Relationships are private, and even if they suspected something, it's not their place to interfere unless there was a direct request for help. However, if they genuinely believed Frank might be cheated on and the test was the only way to confirm, maybe they had good intentions. But the outcome was significant, leading to the end of the marriage and personal consequences for everyone involved.\n\nThe author is defending their actions by shifting blame onto Annie, but the question is whether their own actions contributed to the problem. Since the author's suggestion led directly to Frank taking the test, which ended the marriage, they might share some responsibility. Even if Annie was at fault, the author's role in exposing the infidelity through their suggestion could be seen as overstepping. \n\nSo, considering all this, the answer would lean towards A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they intervened without direct evidence and their actions had severe consequences, even if their intent was to help.\n"
