It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves Frank, Annie, and the author.\n\nFirst, the author is a close friend of Annie, almost like a sister. Annie married Frank, who works in the oil industry with a 14-day on/off schedule. The author suspected for three years that Annie was cheating but didn't have proof. Then, when they found out Annie was pregnant, the author, after a few beers, suggested a paternity test. Frank took it seriously, did the test, and it turned out the kid wasn't his. The author is now getting blamed for ruining the marriage, and they're both isolated. The author defends themselves by saying Annie created the situation and that using the child as an excuse is unfair.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author had a suspicion based on Annie's behavior over three years, but no direct evidence. The author's comment led Frank to get a paternity test, which revealed the infidelity. Now, the question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nOn one hand, the author might have acted out of concern for Frank, thinking they were protecting a friend. But Annie was the one who was unfaithful. The author's action led to the truth coming out, which exposed the cheating. However, the method was questionable\u2014suggesting a paternity test without concrete evidence could be seen as intrusive. But since the author had known Annie since childhood and had a long-standing suspicion, maybe they felt justified.\n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't have proof and acted on a hunch. But the outcome was that Frank found out his wife was cheating, which is a valid reason for the marriage to end. The author is being blamed for speaking up, even though Annie's actions were the root cause. The author might have overstepped by bringing up the paternity test, but in the context of protecting a friend from being deceived, maybe it's understandable.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They were trying to help a friend uncover the truth, even if their approach was a bit heavy-handed. The main issue was Annie's infidelity, so the author's role was more of a catalyst for the truth to come out. Therefore, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
