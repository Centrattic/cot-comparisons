It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The person is asking if the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's sister-in-law, Annie, who cheated on her husband Frank. The author, let's call them the narrator, had a suspicion that Annie was cheating, and during a visit, they made a comment about a paternity test after drinking. This led Frank to actually get a paternity test, which confirmed the child isn't his. Now the narrator is being criticized for \"ruining the marriage\" and causing problems.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. The narrator didn't have direct evidence of cheating, just a feeling. They made a comment in a casual setting, which Frank took seriously and acted on. The key points here are intent and the outcome. The narrator's intention was to ensure Frank was the biological father, but they didn't have evidence. However, they didn't accuse Annie directly; they just suggested a paternity test. \n\nAnnie's actions were deceitful. If she was emotionally cheating and possibly having a child with someone else, that's betrayal. The narrator's comment might have been a way to confirm the suspicion, but they didn't have proof. The question is whether the narrator overstepped by making that suggestion. \n\nOn one hand, the narrator was concerned about the validity of the child's paternity, which is a valid concern for someone close to Frank. On the other hand, making such a comment without evidence could have been hurtful. However, the outcome shows that the narrator's intuition was correct. So, even though the method might have been questionable, the result was uncovering a cheating spouse. \n\nBut the narrator's family is blaming them for ruining the marriage. The narrator might feel they were just supporting Frank, but if the suggestion led to the test, which led to the breakup, they could be seen as the catalyst. However, the real fault lies with Annie for cheating. The narrator's role was more of a catalyst, but they didn't have malicious intent. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the narrator didn't force Frank to take the test; he chose to do it after the comment. So maybe the blame isn't entirely on the narrator. They were trying to help, but perhaps in a way that was intrusive. However, given that the cheating was real, maybe the narrator's intention was right. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the narrator's actions were a reasonable response to their suspicions. Since they didn't have proof, maybe they shouldn't have made that comment. But on the other hand, they were acting in Frank's best interest. The community might see the narrator as overstepping, but the actual wrongdoing was Annie's. So the answer might be that the narrator isn't in the wrong because the cheating happened regardless of their comment.\n"
