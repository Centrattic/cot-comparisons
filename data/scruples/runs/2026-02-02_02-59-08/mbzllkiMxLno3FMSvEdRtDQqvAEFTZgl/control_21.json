It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. The story is about Frank and Annie, where the author (let's call them Alex) is Frank's friend. The key points here are: Alex suspected Annie was cheating because Frank was away a lot, and then suggested a paternity test which confirmed the child wasn't Frank's. Now, Frank is isolated, Annie is left without financial support, and Alex is facing criticism for causing the breakup.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if Alex did something wrong. They mentioned they had a feeling Annie was cheating but weren't sure. They asked Frank about a paternity test after some alcohol. The test led to Frank finding out the truth. The question is whether Alex's actions were justified.\n\nFrom Alex's perspective, they were concerned about their friend getting cheated on, maybe even financially. Supporting Frank in this situation could be seen as loyal. But the issue is that they didn't have concrete evidence and maybe acted on suspicion. However, when Frank took the suggestion seriously and got the test, it turned out the suspicions were right. So, Alex's intervention led to a difficult outcome, but was it their fault?\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that Alex overstepped by bringing up the paternity test without being certain. They might think that Frank should have addressed the issue directly with Annie instead of relying on a friend's suggestion. Also, the family is blaming Alex for the marriage breakdown, which could be unfair because the infidelity was Annie's responsibility.\n\nAnother angle is the child. The family is using the child as an argument, saying Alex should have kept quiet. But if Annie was unfaithful and the child isn't Frank's, is it fair to prioritize the marriage over Frank's rights? Frank has the right to know the child isn't his, which affects his life significantly. So, maybe Alex's action was in Frank's best interest.\n\nHowever, the way Alex approached it\u2014after a few beers and then the suggestion stuck\u2014could be seen as careless. Maybe they should have handled it more discreetly or encouraged Frank to talk to Annie first. But since the result was true, the intent was to help a friend who was being cheated on.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, if Annie was indeed cheating, the problem lies with her. Alex acted on their concern and it turned out to be valid. The family's blame towards Alex seems misplaced because they were just trying to support Frank. So, Alex isn't entirely in the wrong. But maybe they could have handled it better, though the outcome was justified.\n\nSo the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they were supporting a friend in a situation where the cheating was real. However, there's room to argue that they could have approached it differently. But given the outcome, it's not entirely their fault.\n"
