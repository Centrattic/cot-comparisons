It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for supporting the cheated-on husband. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author's friend Annie had a husband, Frank, who was in a marriage where Annie was cheating. The author suspected this for three years but didn't confront her directly. Then, when Annie got pregnant, the author, during a drunk conversation, suggested a paternity test. Frank took the suggestion seriously, got the test, and found out the baby wasn't his. The author is now getting blamed by family for breaking up the marriage and causing Annie to lose her financial stability and home.\n\nThe user wants to know if the author is at fault. The key points here are: the author had suspicions for years but didn't act until after the pregnancy announcement. The suggestion for a paternity test was made in a casual setting (after drinking), which might have been a mistake. However, the author's intention was to help Frank get the truth. But by suggesting the test, the author indirectly contributed to the marriage's collapse.\n\nBut wait, the author's role was as a friend. Friends often offer advice, even if it's not always the best. The question is whether the author overstepped. Since Frank was the one who decided to act on the suggestion, maybe the author isn't entirely responsible. However, the author might have known about the suspicions for a long time and didn't address them directly with Annie before the pregnancy. Instead, they waited until after the fact to bring it up, which could have been more damaging.\n\nAlso, the author's family is blaming them for ruining the marriage. But was the author's action the main cause? Frank was the one who insisted on the paternity test after the suggestion. The author might have just provided the idea, but the decision was Frank's. However, the author's suggestion was the catalyst.\n\nOn the other hand, Annie was cheating, and the author had a close relationship with both parties. The author's intention was to help Frank ensure the child's paternity, which is a valid concern. But the method of bringing it up in a drunken conversation might not be the best approach.\n\nUltimately, the author might not be entirely at fault because they were trying to help a friend uncover the truth. However, the way they approached it could have been more thoughtful. But since Frank made the final decision to get the test, the author's role is more of an enabler rather than the direct cause. So, the answer might be B (No), because the author isn't in the wrong, but it's a nuanced situation.\n"
