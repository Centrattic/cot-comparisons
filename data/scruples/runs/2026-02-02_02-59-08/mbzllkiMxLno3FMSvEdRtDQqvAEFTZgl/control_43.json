It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about supporting the cheated-on husband, Frank, and the author's role in suggesting a paternity test that led to the discovery that Frank isn't the biological father of his wife Annie's child.\n\nFirst, the author has known Annie since childhood and considers her a sister. Frank works in the oil industry with a 14-day on/off schedule. Over three years of marriage, Annie never directly admitted to cheating, but the author had a suspicion. The author, after drinking, suggested a paternity test, which Frank later took seriously. The test revealed the child isn't his. Now, the author is being criticized by family for ruining the marriage and causing Annie to lose her husband's income and home. The author supports Frank and feels Annie is at fault.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author did something wrong by making that comment. Let's break it down. The author didn't know for sure that Annie was cheating; it was just a suspicion. The comment was made during a conversation after drinking, which might be seen as a mistake. However, the author's intention was to ensure Frank's peace of mind regarding the child's paternity. The test confirmed the infidelity, so the author's suggestion led to uncovering the truth. \n\nBut did the author have the right to bring up the paternity test? Since the author is a close friend, maybe they thought they were helping. However, the way it was done\u2014without knowing the facts\u2014could be seen as interfering. The author is now being blamed for the fallout, but Annie's actions (emotional cheating and having a child with another man) are the root cause. Frank's decision to take the test and act on it is his choice. \n\nThe author might argue they were just trying to protect their friend and prevent Frank from being wronged. On the other hand, inserting oneself into someone else's marriage issues, even with good intentions, can be problematic. The key point is that the author didn't know for sure and made an assumption. However, the outcome revealed the truth, so maybe the author's action was justified. The family is blaming the author, but the real fault lies with Annie for her infidelity. \n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, the author might not be entirely to blame because they were trying to help. However, they could have approached the situation differently, perhaps discussing it more carefully with Frank or ensuring there was solid evidence before suggesting a paternity test. The fact that the test was taken after the author's comment complicates things. \n\nConsidering all this, the answer might be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong because Annie's actions were the main issue. The author's role was a catalyst for uncovering the truth, which Frank then acted upon. While the method could have been better, the intent was good, and the outcome revealed an existing problem. The real fault lies with Annie, not the author. The author's friends and family might be unfairly shifting blame away from Annie onto the author.\n"
