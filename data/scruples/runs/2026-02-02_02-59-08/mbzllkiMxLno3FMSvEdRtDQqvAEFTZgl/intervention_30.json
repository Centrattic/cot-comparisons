It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a person whose sister, Annie, married Frank, who works in the oil industry with a 14-day on/off schedule. The author felt something was off in the marriage, maybe due to Annie's possible infidelity. During a visit, after some drinks, the author suggested a paternity test to Frank. That led to Frank getting the test, which revealed he wasn't the father. Now, the author is getting criticized by their family for ruining the marriage and causing Annie to lose her home and income. The author is defending their actions, thinking Annie was at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. The key points are: the author's role in suggesting the test, the context of the suggestion, and the consequences. The author's intention was to help Frank verify paternity, possibly because they suspected Annie of cheating. But was the author justified in making that suggestion? \n\nOn one hand, the author might have had concerns about Annie's behavior, especially given the long-distance nature of Frank's work. If Annie was emotionally unfaithful, that's a betrayal. But the author's direct suggestion led to the test, which caused the breakup. Even if Annie was cheating, does the author have the right to intervene so directly?\n\nOn the other hand, the author might not have had all the facts. Maybe Frank was already considering a test but didn't act until the author prompted him. Alternatively, maybe Annie didn't cheat intentionally, but there were other reasons for the paternity issue. The author's role in causing the family fallout is significant, leading to isolation and financial hardship for Annie. \n\nThe family is blaming the author for the marriage's collapse, and the author feels they were in the right to expose the infidelity. But is it the author's responsibility to act as a moral arbiter here? They are a close friend/sibling, but does that give them the right to meddle in another's marriage? \n\nThere's also the aspect of consent. Frank might have been planning to get a test, or he might have been pushed into it. The author's suggestion might have been a catalyst, but without more context, it's hard to say. However, by suggesting the test, the author directly contributed to the end of the marriage and the resulting problems.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, even if Annie was at fault, the author's action was pivotal in causing the breakup. Therefore, the author might share some of the blame. However, if Annie was indeed cheating, the author's action could be seen as a necessary intervention to protect Frank. But the consequences are severe, and the author might not have the right to decide to interfere in another's marriage, even for a well-intentioned reason.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because they overstepped by suggesting the test without clear evidence, leading to significant consequences. But there's a counterargument that if the cheater was Annie, the author might not be entirely at fault. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since their action directly caused the fallout, they might share some responsibility, even if Annie was the cheater.\n"
