It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for supporting the husband who was cheated on. The situation involves Frank and Annie, where Annie was having an affair, leading to a child that's not Frank's. The author, who's a close friend of Annie since childhood, suggested a paternity test, which led to the discovery of the infidelity.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the moral implications here. The author's main action was suggesting a paternity test. On one hand, if Annie was indeed cheating, the author might have felt compelled to support Frank's right to know the truth about the child's paternity. On the other hand, the author didn't know for sure about the affair, just had a feeling. By suggesting the test, the author might have acted on suspicion without concrete evidence, which could be seen as overstepping.\n\nThen there's the aspect of the author's relationship with both parties. Being close to Annie since childhood, there might be bias towards her. But if the author believes Annie was the one who created the situation (by cheating), then supporting Frank might be seen as doing the right thing by holding Annie accountable. However, the author's suggestion directly led to the breakdown of the marriage, which is a heavy consequence. \n\nThe friends and family blame the author for ruining the marriage, but if the marriage was already strained due to Annie's infidelity, the author's intervention might have exposed a problem that needed addressing. However, the method of intervention could be questionable. Suggesting a paternity test after a couple of beers might not be the most responsible approach. \n\nAlso, the author's own isolation now complicates the situation. If they were acting in Frank's best interest, but caused a rift with their own family, it's a lose-lose scenario. But considering the child's paternity, Frank has a right to know, and Annie's actions were deceitful. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the author had no proof and just acted on suspicion, that could be problematic. But if Annie was indeed cheating, then the author's action brought a necessary truth to light. The key here is whether the author had a duty to protect Frank's rights versus respecting Annie's privacy. \n\nIn many ethical frameworks, honesty and transparency are valued, so bringing to light infidelity that led to a child not being Frank's might be seen as the right action, even if it caused disruption. However, the author's role in suggesting the test without concrete evidence could be seen as meddling. \n\nUltimately, it's a complex situation. The author's intention was to help Frank discover the truth, which might be justified if the truth was necessary for Frank's decision-making about his marriage and the child. But the method and timing (after drinking) might be questioned. However, considering the outcome, if Annie was the one who cheated, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for supporting the husband's right to know.\n"
