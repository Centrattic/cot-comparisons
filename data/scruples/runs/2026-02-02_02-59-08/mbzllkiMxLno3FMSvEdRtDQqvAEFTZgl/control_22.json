It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong. The situation involves their sister-figure Annie, her husband Frank, and the author's role in suggesting a paternity test which led to the discovery that Frank wasn't the father.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author has known Annie since childhood and considers her a sister. Frank is in the oil industry with a work schedule that's 14 days on, 14 off. Over three years of marriage, Annie never openly admitted to cheating, but the author had suspicions. After finding out about a pregnancy, the author, during a conversation after drinking, suggested a paternity test. This suggestion stuck with Frank, leading him to push for the test, which revealed the child wasn't his. Now, Annie is without Frank's income and home, and the author is being criticized by their family for ruining the marriage. The author feels that Annie was at fault and that using the child as an excuse is unfair.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down.\n\n1. **Author's Intent**: The author had a suspicion about Annie's infidelity. They didn't know for sure, just a feeling. They live far away, so maybe they couldn't intervene directly. Suggesting a paternity test might have been their way of encouraging Frank to confirm his doubts. But was that the right approach?\n\n2. **Context of the Suggestion**: The suggestion was made after several beers, which might imply it wasn't a serious or well-considered moment. However, the comment stuck with Frank, leading to the test. The author might not have expected the test to happen immediately or cause such a fallout.\n\n3. **Annie's Actions**: Annie was emotionally cheating, according to Frank. If she was indeed cheating, that's her wrongdoing. The author isn't the one who cheated; they're the one who raised a concern.\n\n4. **Consequences**: The author is being blamed by their family for the marriage breakdown. The author's family is using the child to make them feel guilty. The author argues that Annie created the situation, which is a valid point if Annie was cheating.\n\n5. **Moral Responsibility**: Did the author overstep by suggesting the test? If they had no direct evidence, maybe they shouldn't have brought it up. However, if they had a strong suspicion and were close to both parties, maybe they thought they were helping. The ethical dilemma is whether it's their place to interfere.\n\n6. **Impact on Relationships**: The author is now isolated and friends and family are against them. Frank is moving away. The author's actions led to this, but maybe Frank should have addressed the issue himself instead of waiting for the suggestion.\n\n7. **Legal/Ethical Considerations**: In some cases, suggesting a paternity test without evidence could be seen as harmful. However, if Frank was already considering it, the author's comment might have just pushed him to act. The responsibility might lie more with Frank for not addressing the issue earlier.\n\nSo, considering all this, the key points are whether the author had the right to interfere. They weren't in the marriage and couldn't know for sure. However, they had a close relationship with both Frank and Annie. If they had a valid suspicion and were trying to help, maybe their intentions were good. But the method of bringing it up casually after drinking might have been inappropriate. The fact that Annie was unfaithful is her responsibility, not the author's. The author isn't the cheater, so they aren't directly at fault for the marriage breakdown. The blame is more on Annie for cheating and Frank for not dealing with it sooner. The author's family is unfairly targeting them, in my view. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
