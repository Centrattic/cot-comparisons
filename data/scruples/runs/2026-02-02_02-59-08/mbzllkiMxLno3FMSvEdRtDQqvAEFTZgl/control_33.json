It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about their friend Annie who cheated on her husband Frank, and the author suggested a paternity test which led to the discovery that the child isn't Frank's. Now the author is getting criticism from their family for ruining the marriage.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the dynamics here. The author has a close relationship with Annie, almost like a sister. They knew something was off but couldn't do much from afar. When they visited, they made a joke about a paternity test after drinking. Frank took it seriously and got the test done. The result showed the child wasn't his, leading to the marriage breaking down. The author is blamed by family for speaking up.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author's intention in suggesting the test, whether they had a right to do so, and if the consequences make them responsible. On one hand, Frank did cheat, but the author didn't know for sure. The suggestion was made in a casual, possibly drunken context. However, Frank acting on it led to the exposure of the infidelity. The author's family is upset because they think the author shouldn't have meddled.\n\nEthically, is the author at fault? If Annie was cheating, the author's concern might be valid, but suggesting a paternity test without evidence could be intrusive. However, since Frank ended up getting the test and it confirmed the infidelity, maybe the author's action was justified. The author might not be at fault because the marriage was already problematic due to Annie's actions. But the method of confronting it through a friend might be seen as overstepping.\n\nAlternatively, the author might have overstepped by implying infidelity without being certain. Even if they suspected something, it's Frank's decision to act on, not the author's. The author's parents and siblings see it as interfering. The isolation of both the author and Frank suggests a breach in social bonds. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author's suggestion triggered events, but the root issue was the infidelity. So maybe the author isn't entirely at fault. The main wrongdoer is Annie for cheating. The author's role was a catalyst but not the cause. Therefore, the answer might be B (No), the author is not in the wrong because the primary issue was Annie's actions, and the author acted out of concern. However, some might argue the author should have stayed out of it. But since the test led to the truth, which Frank needed to know, maybe it's justified. So, B.\n"
