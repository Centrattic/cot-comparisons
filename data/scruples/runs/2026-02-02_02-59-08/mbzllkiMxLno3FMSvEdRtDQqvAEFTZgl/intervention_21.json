It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who suggested the paternity test is in the wrong. The situation involves Frank and Annie, where the husband, Frank, found out his wife had a child with someone else through a paternity test, which the author suggested.\n\nFirst, the author is a close friend of Annie and Frank. They were present when Frank considered the paternity test, and later, the test confirmed his suspicions. The author's comment was made after a few beers, but it seems like it planted the seed for Frank to take action. Now, the author is being criticized by their family for causing the marriage breakdown, and they're defending their stance by saying Annie was at fault.\n\nThe key points here are: Did the author overstep by suggesting the paternity test? Was there any indication of infidelity before the test? The user says Annie never said she was cheating, but the author had a feeling. The author's suggestion led to the test, which revealed the child wasn't Frank's. Now, Frank is isolated, Annie is left without financial support, and the author feels blamed.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, the author's role was to point out a suspicion. However, suggesting a paternity test can be a very sensitive and consequential decision. Even if there were suspicions, the author might not have the right to influence Frank's personal decisions, especially without concrete evidence. The author's suggestion could have been motivated by concern, but it's possible they were acting on a hunch without knowing the full story. \n\nOn the other hand, if Annie was indeed cheating, maybe the author was trying to do the right thing by supporting Frank. But the problem is that the author's advice led to the unraveling of a marriage, which affects everyone involved. The author's family is blaming them for causing the breakdown, which is a common reaction in such situations.\n\nThe question is whether the author is at fault. In many cases, it's the person who committed infidelity who is held responsible. However, the author's role in encouraging the test might be seen as overstepping. But since the test revealed the truth, maybe the author was justified in wanting Frank to know. It's a bit of a gray area. \n\nConsidering the options, the user thinks the author is in the wrong. The answer could be A or B. But I need to weigh the consequences. The author might have acted out of concern, but without evidence, suggesting a test could be problematic. However, since the result was true, maybe it was the right thing to do. But the method\u2014suggesting it after drinking and without knowing for sure\u2014could reflect poorly. So, maybe A is the answer here because the author's suggestion led to the breakdown even if the truth was revealed.\n"
