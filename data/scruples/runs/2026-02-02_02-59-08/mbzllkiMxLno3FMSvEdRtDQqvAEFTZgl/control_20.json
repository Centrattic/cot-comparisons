It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is complicated, so I need to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the author's role: They've known Annie since childhood, and she's like a sister. The author's friend Frank married Annie, who works part-time. Frank is in the oil industry with long shifts, which might contribute to the marital issues. The author sensed something was off, like Annie might be cheating, but didn't have proof. When the baby came along, the author suggested a paternity test in a casual setting after drinking. That led to Frank getting the test, which confirmed the baby wasn't his. Now, Annie is left without Frank's income and home, and the author is facing criticism from their family for \"ruining\" the marriage.\n\nThe main question is whether the author is wrong for supporting Frank, who was cheated on, by suggesting the paternity test. Let's consider the key points:\n\n1. **Author's Intent**: The author was concerned about the potential infidelity and wanted to ensure the child was Frank's. Even though it was a casual comment after drinking, the author's intention was to help Frank get the truth. But maybe the way it was brought up was inappropriate? However, since the author wasn't directly accusing Annie, but just suggesting a test, maybe that's a reasonable step once the suspicion is there.\n\n2. **Consequences**: The paternity test led to the marriage ending. Annie is now in a tough spot financially. But Annie was the one who was unfaithful, so maybe the consequences are her own doing. However, the author's suggestion was the trigger, so some might argue they're responsible. But if the marriage was already on shaky ground due to Annie's actions, the test was just exposing the truth.\n\n3. **Family Pressure**: The author's family is upset because they think the author shouldn't have meddled. But the author had a close relationship with both Frank and Annie. They might have felt it was their duty to help Frank, especially since they were close friends. However, the author's family isn't in the same situation as Frank and Annie, so their judgment might be from an outsider's perspective.\n\n4. **Moral Responsibility**: Is the author responsible for the fallout? If Annie was indeed cheating, then the author was helping Frank get the truth. But maybe the author overstepped by suggesting the test without more certainty. However, given that Frank was working long shifts, it's plausible that he was already suspicious. The author's suggestion might have been the catalyst Frank needed to take action.\n\n5. **Emotional Cheating**: The text mentions Frank let slip that Annie was emotionally cheating. Emotional infidelity can be a serious issue, and if that's true, then the marriage was already problematic. The author's role in exposing the paternity issue might have been the necessary step to end a harmful situation.\n\n6. **Isolation**: Both the author and Frank are now isolated from their families and friends. This suggests that the community is taking Annie's side, possibly because of sympathy for her situation (being a single mother) or because they blame the author for causing the breakup. However, from an outsider's view, if Annie was the one who cheated, the isolation might be unfair to the author and Frank.\n\n7. **Ethical Considerations**: The author might have a point in standing by Frank, as it's not his fault that Annie cheated. However, the author's suggestion might have been a breach of privacy if they weren't directly asked. But considering their close relationship, maybe it's justified.\n\nIn summary, the author's actions led to the truth coming out, which exposed the infidelity and the non-paternity. While the author might have been overstepping by suggesting the test, especially if they weren't directly asked, the underlying issue was Annie's infidelity. The author's family's criticism might be misplaced, as the real issue is Annie's actions. Therefore, the author is not necessarily in the wrong, as they were supporting their friend who was wronged. However, there's a case to be made that the author could have handled it more delicately. But given the circumstances, their actions were in line with helping a friend in a difficult situation.\n"
