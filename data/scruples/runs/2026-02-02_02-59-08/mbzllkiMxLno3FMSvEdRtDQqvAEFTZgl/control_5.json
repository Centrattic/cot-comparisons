It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is complicated. So, the author is friends with Annie and Frank. Annie married Frank, who works in oil with a 14-day on/off schedule. The author suspected Annie was cheating but didn't have proof. When they found out Annie was pregnant, the author, after some drinking, suggested Frank consider a paternity test. That suggestion led Frank to get a test, which confirmed the baby wasn't his. Now, Annie is without Frank's income and home, and the author is facing backlash from their family for causing the breakup.\n\nFirst, does the author have a responsibility here? The key point is whether the author overstepped by suggesting the paternity test. The author wasn't a party to the marriage but was close enough to Annie to be a confidant. But they didn't have direct evidence of infidelity, just a feeling. The author's intention might have been to protect Frank, but maybe they acted without knowing the full story. However, Frank did later agree to the test, so the author's suggestion was a catalyst but not the direct cause. \n\nAlso, Annie was emotionally cheating, which is cheating, but maybe not in a way that the author could have known for sure. The author's suspicion was based on intuition and proximity, not concrete proof. But maybe inserting oneself into a marriage like that is inappropriate, even if the intent was good. \n\nThe author is now being blamed by family for ruining the marriage. But if Annie was indeed cheating and the child isn't Frank's, the marriage was already problematic. The author might not be at fault if they were trying to uncover the truth. However, maybe the author should have kept their mouth shut since they weren't in a position to intervene. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer hinges on whether the author had the right to interfere. If the suggestion was based on suspicion without proof, perhaps it's understandable, but it did lead to the breakup. However, since Frank decided to act on the suggestion, the author isn't solely responsible. The main wrongdoer is Annie. Therefore, the author might not be in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
