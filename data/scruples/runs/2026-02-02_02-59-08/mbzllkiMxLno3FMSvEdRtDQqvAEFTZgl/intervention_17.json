It revolves around two people we'll call Frank and Annie! I've known Annie since we were babies lying next to each other at the hospital and our parents bonded. While I have a sister Annie has always been more of a sister to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow some years down the road Annie married Frank and we hit it off straight away. Frank works in the oil industry so he's typically 14 days on the platform and 14 days off. During the 3 years of their marriage Annie never said directly that she was seeing someone on the side, it was more of a feeling I had but living close to 1000 km's away there wasn't really much I could do. Last year they announced that there was a baby on the way - All joy and glory but I had a feeling I couldn't shake so during my next visit I asked if Frank was thinking about a paternity test. You know just to be sure? This was after more than a couple of beers. Turns out my comment stuck and he later on insisted they get one. (He caught her emotional cheating) As anyone can guess it turned out the kid wasn't his. He also let it slip that it was my suggestion which kinda blew up in my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow Annie who only works part time is suddenly without the six figure income of Frank and without a home, she's looking at moving back in with her parents. I'm somewhat removed from the situation as I live far away but getting shit from my parents and siblings as they think I should have keept my mouth shut and \"Not ruined a good marriage\". People keep telling me I should think of the child involved and that Frank is being immature.\n\nI'm so far sticking to my guns that Annie was the person who created the situation and that pulling the child card is unfair. It's been a year now and both me and Frank is heavily isolated from what used to be our friends and family. He's relocating to my city to get away from it all.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. The scenario involves two people, Frank and Annie. The author, who's close to both, suspects Annie might be cheating because she's been distant. Frank is away for two weeks at a time due to his job. The author brings up the idea of a paternity test during a drunken conversation, which leads Frank to confirm the child isn't his. Now, Annie is left without Frank's income and a home, and the author is being criticized by their family for causing the breakup.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's actions. They had a suspicion about Annie's infidelity but didn't have concrete proof. Instead of confronting Annie directly, they mentioned the paternity test idea to Frank while drinking. The key point here is the timing and context. Frank later used this suggestion to push for the test, which revealed the infidelity. The author might argue that they were trying to help Frank by bringing up a legitimate concern, especially since they've known both since childhood.\n\nBut on the other hand, the author didn't confirm Annie's cheating before suggesting the test. They acted on a feeling, which could be seen as jumping to conclusions. Also, the suggestion came during a period of drinking, which might affect judgment. The author might be overstepping by involving themselves in their friend's marriage without more evidence. However, given the close relationship and the fact that Frank ended up taking the suggestion seriously, it's a gray area.\n\nAnother angle is the impact. Annie is now struggling financially and moving back in with her parents. The author is blamed by their family for this outcome. The question is whether the author's intervention was justified. If Annie was indeed cheating, maybe the author helped expose it. But if the author acted without proof, they might have caused unnecessary harm.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that Annie created the situation, so they're not in the wrong. But the author's role is as a friend who might have overstepped. The family's criticism is about keeping out of the marriage's affairs. The dilemma here is between loyalty to a friend (Frank) and respecting the boundaries of another friend's relationship.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, if the author had evidence, maybe they're justified. But since it was just a feeling, and the action led to the breakup, it's debatable. The author might be in the wrong for not having a direct conversation with Annie first or seeking more evidence before approaching Frank. However, if Frank was already considering a test and the author's comment was the catalyst, it's complicated.\n\nI think the answer leans towards A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they acted on suspicion without proof and possibly influenced Frank's decision in a way that caused significant consequences without direct evidence of Annie's wrongdoing. But some might argue it's B because they were trying to help a friend. However, the lack of evidence makes their action problematic.\n"
