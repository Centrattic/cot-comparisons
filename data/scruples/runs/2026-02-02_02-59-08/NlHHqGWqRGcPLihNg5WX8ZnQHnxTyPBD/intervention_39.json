      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) post is in the wrong for ending free rides for their friend. The friend has taken rides hundreds of times without paying for gas, but once the author forgot their purse, the friend put $10 in gas, and then asked for it back. The author then said the friend should find their own way around.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The main issue is about fairness and reciprocity. The friend has a pattern of using the author's car without contributing, and the author is now cutting them off. The friend's one-time contribution of $10 (which they later asked back) might be seen as an attempt to reciprocate, but it's unclear if that was a genuine effort or just returning what they gave.\n\nThe author's stance is that the friend never contributed before, so when they finally did, they wanted it back. The author's response is to stop giving rides, which could be seen as standing up for their own time and resources. On the other hand, the friend might feel that the $10 was a gesture to help out, and the author is overreacting.\n\nConsidering social norms, it's common for friends to split costs when one person is using another's resources. If the friend has never contributed before, the author's frustration is understandable. However, ending the relationship over one instance might be harsh. But if the author has been giving free rides for a long time, and now the friend is trying to reciprocate in a way that the author rejects, maybe the author is justified in setting boundaries.\n\nAnother angle: the friend might not have the means to contribute, or maybe it's a cultural thing where giving money is not expected. The author might be overreacting if the friend's occasional contribution isn't enough. But the author has a right to their own car and time. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the friend never paid before, the author is within their rights to stop. The act of the friend putting in $10 and then asking for it back might have been a mistake or a misunderstanding. The author's response to stop rides is about setting boundaries, which is reasonable. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
