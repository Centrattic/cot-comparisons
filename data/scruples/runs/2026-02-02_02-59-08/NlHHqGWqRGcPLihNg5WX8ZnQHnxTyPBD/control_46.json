      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the person has been giving their friend free rides in their car. The friend always rides with them, the author fills up the gas, picks him up and drops him off. Then, one time, the author forgot their purse, so the friend put $10 in gas. Now the author is asking if they're an asshole for telling the friend to find his own way around from now on.\n\nHmm. So the main question is whether ending the free rides is unfair. Let's break it down. The friend has used the author's car hundreds of times without contributing to gas. The only time they contributed was once when the author forgot their purse. Now the author is saying no more free rides. \n\nFirst, is it reasonable for the author to expect some contribution? If the friend is riding frequently, the cost of gas adds up. The author is covering all the expenses, and the friend isn't contributing. So maybe the author is justified in setting boundaries. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the friend thought it was a favor and didn't realize they needed to pay. But the author didn't mention asking for payment before, so maybe the friend didn't know. However, the author didn't set any expectations initially. So if the author is now changing the terms, is that fair?\n\nBut the friend did put in $10 once, which might imply that they thought it was a one-time thing. The author is now ending it after that single contribution. However, the friend had hundreds of free rides before. So the author might be right to say that's not enough. \n\nAlso, the author is the one providing the service, so they have the right to set conditions. If they don't want to cover all the costs, they can stop offering the rides. Friends should communicate their expectations. Since the author didn't ask for payment before, maybe the friend didn't know. But the author isn't in the wrong for changing their mind now. \n\nSo overall, the author isn't in the wrong. They have the right to stop providing a service that's costing them money without contribution from the friend. The friend should find their own way now.\n"
