      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe user is asking if they're an asshole for ending free friend rides in their car. Their friend has been hopping rides everywhere in their car. The user fills up the tank, picks up the friend at his house, and drops him back safely. On one occasion, the friend put $10 in gas because the user forgot their purse at home, and yesterday he asked the user back for it. The user is saying that their friend has ridden in their car hundreds of times without putting gas in. The user is now telling the friend to find their way around in the future. The question is whether the user is in the wrong.\n\nSo, the main point here is about the friend contributing to gas costs. The user's friend usually doesn't pay, but once he did. The user is ending the rides, possibly because the friend hasn't consistently contributed. Let me think about the context. \n\nFirst, is it reasonable for friends to split gas costs? That's a common courtesy, especially if someone is frequently using your car for transportation. The user is covering all the gas, which can add up. If the friend is using the car hundreds of times without contributing, that might be seen as taking advantage. But the user mentions that the friend did put $10 in gas once, perhaps as a gesture when the user forgot their purse. The user might feel that since the friend hasn't consistently contributed, ending the rides is justified.\n\nHowever, the user is ending the rides for not contributing gas, but the friend did contribute once. Maybe the user is being too strict here. Alternatively, if the user always covers the gas, maybe the friend wasn't expected to contribute. But the user might be feeling that it's unfair to bear all the costs. \n\nAnother angle: the user is the driver, so they have the right to set boundaries. If they're tired of the arrangement, it's reasonable to stop. The user's friend might not have realized the cost was an issue. The user could have asked for a contribution earlier. But since they're ending it now, maybe it's a bit abrupt. However, the user's right to end the arrangement is their own choice. \n\nIs the user in the wrong? If the user was explicit about expecting gas money from the start, then the friend's lack of contribution would be a problem. If not, then maybe the user is overreacting. But the user is the one providing the service (transportation), so they can end it whenever they want. The fact that the friend contributed once might have been a minor point, but the user is ending it because the friend hasn't done it consistently. \n\nSo, considering all that, the user isn't necessarily in the wrong. They can decide to stop providing rides for any reason. The friend might be in the wrong for not contributing, but the user is ending the rides, which is their choice. Therefore, the answer might be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
