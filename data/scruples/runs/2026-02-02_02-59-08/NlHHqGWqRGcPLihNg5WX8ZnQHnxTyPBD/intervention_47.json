      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author ends free rides for their friend, who usually takes rides in their car without contributing. The friend once put $10 in gas when the author forgot their purse, and then asked to retrieve it. The author now tells the friend to find their own way around.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The friend has used the author's car hundreds of times without contributing. The author might feel taken advantage of. The friend's one-time contribution was $10, which is a small amount compared to the frequent rides. The author is ending the arrangement, which could be seen as self-defense against being used.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides. Is it fair for the author to stop giving rides after being asked to contribute once? The key here is consistency. If the author expects the friend to contribute to gas every time, but the friend only did it once, the author might feel it's unfair to continue without consistent help. Ending the rides could be a way to set boundaries. On the other hand, the friend might feel the author is being petty over a small amount.\n\nAnother angle: the author is the one providing the service (transportation) and the friend is the one receiving it without contributing. The author has the right to set terms for their own time and resources. If the friend isn't willing to meet those terms, the author can choose to stop. The fact that the friend contributed once might not be enough to justify continued free rides.\n\nAlso, the author's statement \"find your way around in the future\" is a clear boundary. The author isn't being hostile but is stating a condition. The friend might have misunderstood the author's expectations. The author isn't in the wrong for setting limits after being used repeatedly. So, the answer is B (No).\n"
