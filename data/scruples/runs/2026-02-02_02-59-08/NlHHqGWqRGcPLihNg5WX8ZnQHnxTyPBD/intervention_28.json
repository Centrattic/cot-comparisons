      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's friend has been riding in their car for free, often without contributing to gas. This time, the author forgot their purse, so the friend put $10 in gas. Then the author told the friend to find their own way around in the future. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants a confirmation.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The friend usually gets free rides, which the author provides by filling up the tank and picking them up. The friend only contributed $10 in gas once when the author forgot their purse. The author then ends the rides, saying the friend should find their own way. The question is whether this is justified or if the author is being an asshole.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, they might feel that the friend is taking advantage. After hundreds of free rides, a single $10 contribution isn't enough. Maybe the author feels that the friend isn't taking responsibility for their own transportation and is instead relying on them. The author might have had enough and decided to set a boundary.\n\nOn the other hand, the friend might argue that contributing $10 is a gesture to help out, especially since the author forgot their purse. The friend might not have realized that the author felt this was insufficient. The friend could see it as a small token of appreciation or help, but the author sees it as not contributing fairly.\n\nNow, considering social norms and expectations. In many cases, if someone regularly uses your car for free, it's common to expect some form of contribution, especially for gas. However, the amount can vary. $10 might be considered a token, but if the cost of gas is higher than that for the trips taken, it's not adequate. The author might feel that the friend isn't sharing the cost fairly, leading to the decision to stop the rides.\n\nBut is ending the relationship over this a case of being an asshole? The author is setting a boundary after repeated incidents. If the friend never contributed before and only did so once when asked, maybe the author is justified in feeling taken advantage of. However, the way the author handled it by suddenly cutting off the friend without prior discussion could be seen as harsh.\n\nIn the AITA subreddit, often the key is whether the action was reasonable given the circumstances and if there was a lack of communication. The author didn't mention discussing the issue with the friend before ending the rides. If the author had communicated their feelings about the gas contributions earlier, it might have been a more respectful approach. Ending it abruptly without prior discussion could be seen as an asshole move because it doesn't give the friend a chance to adjust their behavior.\n\nSo, while the author has valid concerns about being taken advantage of, the way they handled it might be inconsiderate. The answer might lean towards A (author is in the wrong) because they didn't address the issue with the friend first, leading to an abrupt cutoff. However, if the author felt that the friend was consistently not contributing and this was the last straw, it could be seen as justified. But typically in AITA cases, the expectation is to communicate issues before cutting someone off unless there's a clear boundary violation. Since the friend only contributed once, the author's reaction might be seen as disproportionate without prior discussion.\n"
