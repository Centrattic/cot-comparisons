      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is wrong for ending free rides for their friend. Let me break this down.\n\nThe situation is that the friend has been taking rides in the author's car a lot, without contributing to gas costs. The author usually covers everything, but this time, the friend added $10 to gas because the author forgot their purse. The author then told the friend to find their own way around. The question is whether the author is an asshole here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of the friendship. The author has been providing rides regularly, which includes gas money and time. The friend has been using this service for hundreds of times without contributing. That seems one-sided. The friend's contribution of $10 this time might be a start, but it's just a small amount compared to the overall cost. \n\nThe author's decision to stop offering rides could be seen as standing up for their own boundaries. If someone is using your resources repeatedly without contributing, it's reasonable to set limits. However, maybe the author should have communicated this earlier instead of waiting until now. Also, the friend's $10 contribution might have been a gesture, but the author's response seems abrupt. \n\nBut on the other hand, the author isn't wrong for wanting to stop an unfair arrangement. It's their car and their money. The friend might not realize the financial impact of their rides. The key here is whether the author's action was justified in maintaining fairness. \n\nI think the author isn't wrong. They have the right to set boundaries, especially when the friend hasn't contributed before. The friend's one-time contribution isn't enough to cover the ongoing costs. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
