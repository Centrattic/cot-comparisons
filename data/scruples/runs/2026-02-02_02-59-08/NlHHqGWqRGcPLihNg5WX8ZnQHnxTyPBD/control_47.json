      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who ended the free rides is in the wrong.\n\nThe situation is that the author's friend often rides in their car, with the author covering gas and pickup/drop-off. Recently, the friend put $10 in gas because the author forgot their purse. Now the friend is asking for the purse back, and the author told them to find their own way in the future. The question is if the author is an asshole (AITA) for ending the free rides.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The friend has used the car a lot without contributing to gas, except once. The author might feel it's unfair that the friend hasn't contributed before. But the friend did put in $10 once, which the author is now asking for back. The author is ending the rides, possibly because they're tired of subsidizing the friend's transportation.\n\nBut wait, the friend only put gas once, which was a specific instance. The author is ending the arrangement after that. The friend might have been expecting to continue riding for free unless they had to contribute now. It's possible the friend didn't realize they should contribute each time. The author might be acting out of frustration from past favors without compensation.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the friend didn't pay for gas most of the time. The author decided to end the rides after one instance where the friend did contribute. The author's stance could be that the friend should contribute or find their own way. Since the friend didn't pay before, the author is within their rights to stop the arrangement. The friend might be surprised, but the author isn't obligated to continue providing rides without compensation. So the answer might be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong).\n"
