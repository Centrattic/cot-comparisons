      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for ending free rides for their friend. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the friend frequently uses the author's car for rides. The author fills up the gas and picks up/drops off the friend. Recently, the friend added $10 in gas once because the author forgot their purse. Now, the author is telling the friend to find their own way around. The question is whether the author is an asshole (AITA) for ending this arrangement.\n\nSo, the key points here are the friend's consistent use of the car without contributing to gas costs and the one time they did contribute. The author is ending the rides, possibly because they feel the friend isn't covering the gas they've used hundreds of times. The friend only put $10 in gas once, which might not even cover the cost of the trips they've taken. \n\nI need to consider fairness. If the friend has been using the car a lot without contributing, it's reasonable for the author to ask for compensation. However, the author now is saying the friend should find their own way. Is this a fair response? Well, the author isn't obligated to provide free rides, so ending it because the friend didn't pay for gas seems justified. The friend might have assumed the author would always cover the costs, but that's not necessarily the case. The author is setting a boundary here, which might be necessary if they feel taken advantage of. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author should have communicated about gas costs earlier instead of waiting until the one time the friend contributed. But the fact remains that the friend only contributed once, which is minimal compared to the number of rides. The author's frustration is understandable. So, the answer might be that the author isn't in the wrong. Let me check if there's any nuance I'm missing. The friend might have thought it was a favor, but if the author is covering all costs repeatedly, it's a one-sided arrangement. The author has the right to change their mind and set boundaries. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
