      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) post is in the wrong for ending free rides for their friend. The situation is that the friend often takes rides in the author's car, and the author fills up the gas. The friend only put gas once when the author forgot their purse, and the author now told the friend to find their own way around.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend has used the car hundreds of times without contributing to the gas. Gas is a cost, so maybe the author is justified in not covering that unless it's a mutual agreement. The friend only contributed once, which seems like a minor exception. The author is asking if they're an asshole for ending the rides. \n\nThe key points here are the friend's consistent use of the author's car without contributing except once, and the author ending it without prior discussion. The author might feel that their time and money are being taken advantage of. Friends should ideally have mutual respect and understanding. If the author never set boundaries before, maybe they had the opportunity to mention this earlier. However, the friend's behavior might be seen as taking something for granted. \n\nBut also, friends helping each other out is common. However, when one person is consistently contributing more than the other, that can create an imbalance. The author might feel that the friend isn't considering their expenses. On the flip side, maybe the author should have communicated their feelings about the gas costs earlier instead of cutting off the rides suddenly. \n\nThe friend's single act of putting gas in isn't enough to counter hundreds of times when they didn't. So the author's frustration is understandable. But perhaps the right approach would have been to have a conversation about it rather than ending it abruptly. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the friend never agreed to share gas costs, the author isn't obligated to provide rides. So the author has the right to set boundaries, even if it's after many rides. \n\nSo, considering all that, maybe the author isn't in the wrong because they're setting a boundary about their own resources. The friend's behavior might be the issue here. The answer might be B (No), but I need to make sure there's no cultural context or social norms I'm missing. In many cases, using someone's car without contributing to costs could be seen as taking advantage. So the author's decision to stop is reasonable. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
