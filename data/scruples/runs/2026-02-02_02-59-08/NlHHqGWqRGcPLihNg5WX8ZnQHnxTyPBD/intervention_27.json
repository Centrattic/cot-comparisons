      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for ending free rides for their friend. The situation is that the friend often rides in their car, the author fills up the gas, picks them up and drops them off. Recently, the friend put $10 in gas because the author forgot their purse. The next day, the friend asked for the purse back. The author then told the friend to find their own way around.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. I need to decide between A (author is in the wrong) or B (not in the wrong).\n\nFirst, the key points: The friend uses the car a lot without contributing to gas. One time they did put $10 when the author forgot their purse. Then the friend asked for the purse back, and the author ended the rides. The author's reasoning is that the friend hasn't contributed to gas before, so they're cutting off the rides. \n\nIs the author justified? Well, the friend usually gets free rides. The $10 instance is a one-time thing. The author might feel that the friend isn't contributing to the cost of gas, which is a fair concern. The author is the one paying for gas, maintenance, etc., and the friend isn't helping. So when the author says \"find your way around,\" maybe they're standing up for themselves, making the friend take responsibility. \n\nOn the other hand, the friend did put $10 in gas once, which might have been a kind gesture. But the author is ending the rides because of that one time? Or because the friend hasn't contributed before. The author could have just asked for gas money in general, but instead, they waited until the friend did contribute once and then cut them off. Maybe the author is reacting to the friend's lack of contribution, which is valid. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the author is overreacting. The friend's $10 was a good gesture, but the author is ending all rides because of the friend's past behavior. If the friend usually doesn't pay, the author is within their rights to stop the rides, especially if it's a financial burden. So the author isn't in the wrong for setting a boundary. \n\nBut maybe the author should have communicated better. Instead of cutting off abruptly, they could have asked the friend to contribute to gas costs. However, the author might not have done that, and now they're ending the rides. Is that fair? It depends on the expectations. If the author never mentioned contributing to gas, then the friend might not have known. But if the author is the one paying for gas, it's reasonable to expect some contribution. \n\nSo overall, the author is setting a boundary after the friend's consistent behavior of not contributing. The author isn't wrong for ending the rides. The answer is B.\n"
