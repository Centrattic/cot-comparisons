      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about ending free rides for a friend. The friend usually rides in the author's car without contributing to gas, but once put $10 in gas when the author forgot her purse. Now the author is saying the friend should find their own way around. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend has used the author's car hundreds of times without contributing. The only time they helped with gas was once. The author is ending the rides because they feel it's unfair. So, the core issue is about fairness and reciprocity.\n\nIn relationships, especially with friends, there's an expectation of mutual respect and consideration. If one person is consistently relying on another without reciprocating, it can be a problem. The author is setting a boundary here, which is understandable. The friend's single act of putting gas in isn't enough to negate the hundreds of free rides. The author is asking the friend to take responsibility for transportation, which is reasonable.\n\nHowever, the way it's phrased might matter. If the author was abrupt or didn't communicate the expectation earlier, that could be an issue. But the question is about whether the author is in the wrong for ending the free rides. The key point is the friend's lack of contribution over time versus the one-time help.\n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong. They're setting a boundary after repeated one-sided use. The friend should have contributed more consistently. So the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
