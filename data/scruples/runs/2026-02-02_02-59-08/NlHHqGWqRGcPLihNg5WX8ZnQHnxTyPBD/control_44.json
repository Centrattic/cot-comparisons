      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is at fault for ending free rides for their friend. The friend usually gets rides without contributing, but this one time, after the author forgot their purse, the friend put in $10 for gas. Then the author decided to tell the friend to find their own way around.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author has been giving rides consistently, which likely involves time, fuel, and effort. The friend has taken advantage of this without contributing, except once when they added gas money. The author is now ending the rides because they feel it's unfair that the friend didn't contribute before. \n\nThe friend might argue that they only contributed once and the author is being unfair for ending it because of that. But the author's perspective is that they've been covering all costs, and the one-time contribution isn't enough. Social norms often expect some reciprocity in such situations. If someone consistently uses your resources without giving back, it's reasonable to set boundaries. \n\nThe key points are consistency and fairness. The friend's one-time contribution isn't enough to justify ongoing free rides. The author is within their rights to stop the rides, especially if they feel taken advantage of. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
