      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for ending free rides to their friend. The situation is that the friend always rides with them, the author fills up the gas, picks up the friend, drops them off. Last weekend, the friend put $10 in gas because the author forgot their purse at home, and when asked for it back, the author told the friend to find their own way around now.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know my opinion. I need to decide between A (author is wrong) or B (not wrong). \n\nFirst, let's break down the scenario. The friend has been riding with the author multiple times without contributing to gas. The author has covered the gas cost, maybe as a favor since the friend forgot the purse. Then, when the friend once puts $10 in gas, the author asks for it back and cuts off the rides. \n\nThe key points here: Has the friend been using the author's car and gas without contributing, except once? The author is ending the rides because the friend didn't contribute before. The friend putting in $10 is a one-time thing. The author is now asking for that $10 back and refusing future rides.\n\nIn terms of fairness, if the friend usually doesn't contribute, then expecting them to cover the gas now could be inconsistent. The author might feel taken advantage of, but when the friend did contribute once, the author is holding onto that and using it as a reason to end the rides. However, the author's reasoning is that the friend hasn't contributed before, so they should find their own way. \n\nBut maybe the author should have addressed the issue earlier. Instead of ending the rides abruptly after a single contribution, they could have discussed it. The fact that the friend put $10 in gas might have triggered the author to ask for it back, but the author is now cutting off a long-standing arrangement over a one-time act of the friend. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is within their rights to set boundaries. If the friend never contributed to gas before, the author might feel it's unfair to keep covering the cost. The author is now asking for the $10 back, which the friend did contribute, but the main issue is the prior use of the car without contribution. \n\nBut the author's response seems a bit harsh. Ending the rides entirely because the friend didn't pay gas in the past might not be fair, especially if the friend's one-time contribution is being used as leverage. The author could have asked for gas money consistently and then ended the rides if not paid. Instead, it seems like the author is reacting to a single time the friend did pay, which is a bit unfair. \n\nSo, considering the friend's prior behavior of not contributing, the author might be justified in stopping the rides. However, the way they did it might be seen as unfair because the friend had only once contributed. The author is punishing the friend for previous actions by ending the relationship over a single instance of contribution. \n\nAlternatively, the author might feel that the friend is taking advantage, so ending the rides is their right. But if the author didn't address the issue before and only reacted when the friend did contribute, it's possible the author is being inconsistent. \n\nI think the main issue is that the author is cutting off the friend for something (not paying gas) that the friend hadn't done before. The author's own action of asking for the $10 back when the friend paid once is a bit of a trap. The author is using that one instance to justify ending the rides, even though the friend had a history of not contributing. \n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong because they are ending the arrangement based on a single contribution while ignoring the prior non-contribution. Alternatively, the author is justified in ending the rides because the friend never paid before, and the author is setting a boundary now. \n\nHmm. It's a bit tricky. Maybe the author is not in the wrong because they have the right to set boundaries, but the way they did it is abrupt. However, in terms of fairness, if the friend didn't pay gas in the past, the author is within their rights to stop. The friend might have thought it was a free ride, but the author is asserting their own costs now. \n\nI think the answer is B (author not in the wrong) because they are setting a boundary. The friend's one-time contribution is not the main issue; the main issue is the prior non-contribution. The author is now saying that since the friend hasn't paid before, they can't ride anymore. It's a bit of a harsh move, but the author is not in the wrong for enforcing their own terms.\n"
