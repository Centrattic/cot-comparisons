      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) post is wrong for ending free rides for their friend. The situation is that the friend often hops rides in the author's car, with the author filling up the gas. One time, the author forgot their purse, so the friend put $10 into gas, and then asked for it back. The author is now cutting off the rides. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The friend has taken advantage of the rides multiple times without contributing, and the author is finally standing their ground. The friend's action of putting $10 in gas might be seen as a gesture to help, but then asking for it back complicates things. The author's response is to stop offering rides, which could be seen as justified because the friend hasn't contributed before except this one time. \n\nBut wait, maybe the friend's $10 was just a one-time thing, and the author is cutting off all rides over that. Is that fair? The friend might have felt grateful and offered the $10, but then expected it back. The author could argue that since the friend never contributed before, this was a bad precedent, so they're ending the arrangement. Alternatively, the friend might feel it's reasonable to help once in a while when needed. \n\nHowever, the key point is that the friend has used the author's car hundreds of times without contributing. The author is finally setting boundaries, which is understandable. The friend's request for the $10 back might have been a mistake or an oversight, but the author is using that as a reason to stop all rides. Is that overreacting? Maybe, but considering the history, the author has a valid point. The user thinks the author is wrong, but I might lean towards the author being in the right because they're setting boundaries after repeated one-sided use.\n"
