      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole?) question is in the wrong. The situation is about ending free rides for their friend. The friend has been getting rides in their car for hundreds of times without contributing to gas. The author says they ended it by telling the friend to find another way around. The friend then put $10 in gas, but the author is now being called an asshole for ending the rides.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author's actions were wrong. The key points here are about fairness, expectations, and communication. The friend was taking rides without contributing to gas. The author had to cover the gas costs each time, which can add up. The friend only contributed once after being reminded. The author decided to stop offering the rides. \n\nIn many cases, people might expect that if they're using someone else's resources (like gas), they should contribute. The fact that the friend only contributed once after the author forgot their purse suggests that the friend didn't see the need to contribute before. The author's decision to stop the rides could be seen as standing up for their own expenses and setting boundaries. \n\nHowever, some might argue that the author didn't communicate the expectation of contributing to gas earlier. If the author never mentioned that the friend should pay for gas, then the friend might not have known. But the author also didn't mention this in the question, so maybe they assumed it was understood or didn't want to confront the friend. \n\nOn the other hand, the friend has used the service for a long time without paying. The author's request for $10 was a one-time thing, not a regular contribution. The author is now being asked if they're in the wrong for ending the rides. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at whether the person acted unreasonably. Here, the author is trying to set a boundary after being taken advantage of. The friend's behavior was using the author's resources without contributing, which is a common issue in such stories. The author's response is to stop the arrangement, which is a reasonable way to protect their own interests. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. They had the right to set boundaries and end the rides when they felt it was necessary. The friend's lack of contribution over time justified the author's decision. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
