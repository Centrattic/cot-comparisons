      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for ending free rides for their friend. The situation is that the friend usually rides with the author, using the author's car, filling up gas, etc. This time, the author forgot their purse, so the friend put $10 in gas as a return. The author then told the friend to find their own way around.\n\nThe user thinks the author is wrong. I need to evaluate this. First, the friend has been riding for hundreds of times without contributing. The one time they did put in $10, the author cuts off rides. That seems a bit harsh. The friend might not be able to contribute every time, maybe due to forgetfulness or other reasons. The author is punishing them for one instance where they tried to repay, which could be seen as unfair. But on the other hand, the author might be frustrated that the friend never contributes except once. \n\nBut the friend is trying to be helpful here. The author's response of cutting off all rides seems disproportionate. Ending the rides because of a one-time effort to repay might not be justified. The author could have been more understanding, maybe asked for regular contributions or set clear expectations. So I think the author is in the wrong here. Answer A.\n"
