      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about ending free rides for their friend. The friend usually rides with them a lot, and the writer provides gas and picks them up. This time, the friend put in $10 for gas because the writer forgot their purse, and then later asked for that money back. The writer is now telling the friend to find their own way around.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the writer is an asshole for ending the free rides. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the friend has been riding in the writer's car hundreds of times without contributing to gas. That seems like a one-sided arrangement. The writer is covering the cost of gas and the time. Then, when the friend does put in money once, the writer asks for it back. The friend might feel that this is inconsistent or unfair. But the writer is saying that since they usually don't put gas, this time was an exception. \n\nThe writer's reasoning is that the friend should find their own way now. The key points here are consistency and fairness. The friend has been relying on the writer's generosity for a long time. When the friend did contribute once, the writer wanted that money back, which could be seen as being petty or not appreciating the gesture. However, the writer might argue that they were just asking for what was given back, which is fair. \n\nAnother angle is the concept of reciprocity. If the friend never contributed before, maybe the writer is justified in not continuing to provide rides without any contribution. The friend might not have been considering the writer's expenses all this time. The writer might feel that it's unfair to keep covering the costs alone. \n\nBut when the friend did put in $10, the writer took it back, which could be seen as a negative reaction. Maybe the friend was trying to show they could contribute, but the writer's response was not appreciative. However, the writer's argument is that the friend's contribution was an exception, and they still haven't contributed regularly. \n\nSo, the writer is ending the rides because the friend hasn't been contributing. But in the past, the friend didn't contribute either. The writer might be right in setting boundaries, especially if they're tired of covering all the costs. On the other hand, maybe they should have addressed the issue earlier instead of ending it abruptly. \n\nIn terms of social norms, friends often help each other out occasionally, but there's a line when it's one-sided. The writer might be justified in not continuing if they feel it's unfair. However, the way they reacted to the friend's one-time contribution could be seen as harsh. \n\nOverall, considering the situation, the writer might not be in the wrong because they're setting a boundary after a long period of the friend not contributing. The friend might need to step up and contribute more, but the writer is now enforcing that. So the answer is probably B (the writer is not in the wrong).\n"
