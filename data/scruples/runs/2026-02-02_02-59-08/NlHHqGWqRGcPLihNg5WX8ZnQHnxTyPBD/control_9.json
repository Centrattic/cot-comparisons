      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for ending free rides for their friend. The situation is that the friend always rides in their car, they fill up the gas, and pick up and drop off the friend. Last weekend, the friend put $10 in gas because the author forgot their purse at home and asked the friend back for it. The author then said the friend should find their own way around. The question is whether the author is an asshole (A) or not (B).\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The friend has been taking rides hundreds of times without contributing to gas. The author is covering all the costs, including gas, time, and convenience. Last time, the friend did put $10 in gas when asked, which the author might have seen as a one-time gesture. The author then decides to stop giving rides, which is the main point of contention here.\n\nNow, considering the expectations. Friends often help each other out, but there's a balance. If one person is always contributing and the other never reciprocates, that can be a problem. The author might feel that they're being taken advantage of, especially when the friend only contributed once. The friend might argue that they're just helping when they can, but the author is tired of covering all the costs.\n\nThe key points here are: 1) Did the friend have an obligation to pay for gas all along? 2) Is the author justified in ending the rides because the friend only paid once after many free rides? \n\nIn terms of social norms, sometimes friends split costs when sharing a ride. However, if the author hasn't explicitly asked for gas money before, the friend might not have been aware of the expectation. The fact that the friend did pay once might not be enough to make up for the hundreds of times they didn't. The author's decision to stop rides could be seen as a reasonable response to the imbalance, especially if they feel it's unfair.\n\nOn the other hand, if the author never communicated the expectation of gas money upfront, the friend might not have known to contribute. The author could be expected to set clear boundaries earlier. However, in this case, the author is now setting a boundary after years of the friend not contributing. It's a bit of a gray area. The friend's one-time payment might not be sufficient to make up for the past, so the author is asserting their right to stop the rides. \n\nI think the author is not in the wrong. They're addressing a long-standing imbalance where the friend didn't contribute to the costs. The one-time payment isn't enough to negate the history of free rides. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
