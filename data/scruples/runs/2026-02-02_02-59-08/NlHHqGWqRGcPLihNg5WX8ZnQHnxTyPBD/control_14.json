      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that their friend always rides in their car for free. The author fills up the gas and picks the friend up and drops him off. Last weekend, the friend put $10 in gas because the author forgot their purse. Now the friend is asking for the money back, and the author is saying they won't do that anymore, telling the friend to find their own way.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend has been getting free rides hundreds of times without contributing. The author is covering all the gas costs. Then, when the friend does put in $10 once, maybe as a gesture, the author forgot their purse. Now the friend is asking for the $10 back. The author is ending the free rides, which is the point of the question.\n\nIs the author justified in stopping the free rides? Well, if the friend is used to getting free rides and suddenly expects a reimbursement for a one-time contribution, that might be unfair. The author might feel that since the friend never contributed before, asking for the $10 is unreasonable. So by ending the free rides, the author is setting a boundary. \n\nBut wait, the friend put $10 in gas once. Does that mean the author is now in a position where they have to expect the friend to contribute more? Or was that a one-off thing? If the friend is now asking for the $10 back, maybe they don't see it as a gesture but as an actual payment. The author might be frustrated because they've been covering all costs and the friend is now trying to get a refund for a single contribution.\n\nThe author is saying \"find your way around in the future,\" which implies they won't provide free rides anymore. The question is whether that's fair. If the friend is used to free rides, the author has every right to stop. The fact that the friend put $10 in once and then asked for it back might be the last straw for the author. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong here because they're ending a pattern of free rides. The friend's request for the $10 back could be seen as a breach of the initial understanding. The author is setting boundaries, which is reasonable. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
