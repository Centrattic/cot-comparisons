      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for ending free friend rides. The friend has used their car hundreds of times without putting gas, but this time they put 10 in. The author says \"find your way around in the future\" after the friend asked for it back.\n\nHmm. So the main question is whether the author is an asshole. The friend has been getting rides for a long time without contributing, but once the author forgot their purse and the friend put gas, the author decided to stop. The author's response seems sudden. \n\nFirst, maybe the author has a right to set boundaries. If the friend has been using their car without contributing, maybe the author is entitled to say something now. But the friend did put gas in once, and the author is ending all rides. Is that overreacting? \n\nOn the other hand, the author did offer a ride home. Maybe it's unfair to end all future rides because of past behavior. The friend might not have expected to pay every time, but this punishment seems harsh. \n\nBut maybe the author is justified. If they've been taken advantage of repeatedly, they might feel they need to set a boundary. However, the way they did it\u2014saying \"find your way around\"\u2014could be seen as cutting off the friend without a clear reason, especially since the friend tried to help this time. \n\nWait, the friend put 10 in gas because the author forgot their purse. So maybe that's a separate issue. The author might feel that the friend should contribute to gas, and since they've done it only once, they're ending the rides. But if the author never asked for payment before, the friend might not have known to contribute. \n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong because they never communicated expectations. If they wanted the friend to pay for gas, they should have mentioned it earlier. Now, after the fact, ending the rides because of past behavior might be unfair. \n\nBut the friend's action of putting gas in could be a sign of goodwill, and the author's response is cutting off rides entirely. That seems disproportionate. Maybe a better approach would be to ask for payment from now on, rather than terminating the arrangement. \n\nAlternatively, if the author is tired of the friend not contributing and sees this as a chance to set a boundary, maybe they're not wrong. But the way they did it might be abrupt. \n\nI think the key points are communication and proportionality. The author didn't set clear expectations, so the friend might not have known to pay. Then, punishing the friend for past actions with an all-or-nothing approach could be seen as harsh. So the author is in the wrong because they didn't communicate and overreacted.\n"
