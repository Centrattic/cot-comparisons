      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about ending free rides for a friend who's used the author's car hundreds of times without paying for gas. The friend did put in $10 once when the author forgot her purse, and then asked for it back. Now the author says the friend should find their own way around.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of the relationship. The author is providing a service (transportation) without compensation. The friend has been using it for a long time. The key question is whether the author is justified in ending this because the friend didn't pay for gas except once. \n\nThe friend only contributed $10 once, which was then returned. That's not consistent support. The author might feel that since the friend didn't contribute most of the time, they're not being fair. But friends often help each other out without expecting repayment every time. However, if the author feels that the arrangement is one-sided and they're bearing all the costs (gas, car wear and tear), then it's reasonable to set boundaries.\n\nOn the other hand, the friend might not have realized the financial burden. Maybe the author never mentioned the cost before, so the friend didn't think to contribute. But the author is now ending the rides, which could be seen as a sudden change. But the author has the right to set their own limits. \n\nThe author isn't asking for payment in the future but just wants the friend to find their own way. That's a reasonable boundary. The fact that the friend only contributed once and then got the money back doesn't justify continuing the free rides. So the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for stopping it. They're taking back their car usage and setting a limit. \n\nSo, answer B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
