      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about ending free rides for a friend. The friend has been getting rides in the author's car hundreds of times without putting gas in, but this time the friend added $10 because the author forgot their purse. Then the author told the friend to find their own way around. The question is whether the author is an asshole for doing that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend has been relying on the author's car for transportation without contributing anything. That seems like a one-sided arrangement. The author is covering all the costs\u2014gas, time, maybe wear and tear on the car. The friend hasn't contributed anything except this one time when they added $10. The author is asking if it's wrong to end this arrangement.\n\nNow, the key points here are: the friend's repeated use without contribution, the one-time contribution, and the author's decision to stop. The author is frustrated that their friend hasn't contributed before and is now asking for something back (the purse). The author is setting a boundary, which is a common thing to do when someone feels taken advantage of. \n\nBut maybe there's a nuance. Did the friend put $10 in gas as a way to help or just as a gesture? The author might feel it's a small amount compared to the ongoing cost. Also, the friend might not have the means to contribute regularly. But the author has the right to set boundaries. \n\nIs it fair for the author to end the rides? Well, if the friend has been using the car without contributing, the author isn't obligated to provide transportation. The friend might have expected this as a favor, but the author is now saying enough. The author isn't wrong for wanting to stop, especially since the friend hasn't reciprocated. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author could have asked for help earlier instead of ending it abruptly. But the author hasn't mentioned asking before. They just decided to stop after this incident. So in terms of fairness, the author isn't in the wrong. The friend was using a privilege without contributing, and the author is correcting that. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
