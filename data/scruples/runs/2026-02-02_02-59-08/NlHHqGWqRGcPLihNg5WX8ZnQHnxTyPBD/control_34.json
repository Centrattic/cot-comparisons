      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for ending free friend rides in their car. The situation is that the friend often rides in their car, the writer fills up the gas and picks them up. One time, the friend put $10 in gas when the writer forgot their purse, and now the writer is telling the friend to find their own way around. The options are A (yes, they're wrong) or B (no, not wrong).\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend has used the writer's car hundreds of times without contributing to gas. The one time the friend did pay was when the writer forgot their purse. The writer then decides to stop offering rides. \n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, if someone is consistently using your resources without contributing, it's reasonable to set boundaries. The writer is not obligated to provide rides for their friend indefinitely without any contribution. The friend's one-time payment doesn't balance out the hundreds of times they didn't contribute. The writer has the right to decide how to use their car and time. \n\nAlso, the writer is asking the friend to find their own transportation, which is a reasonable request. It's not about being mean but about setting limits. The friend's initial behavior of always using the writer's car without reciprocating might have been the issue. The writer isn't wrong for not continuing to subsidize the friend's transportation without any contribution. \n\nSo, the answer should be B (no, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
