      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for ending free friend rides in their car. The situation is that the friend has been getting rides regularly, and the author ends it after the friend puts in $10 for gas once. The author justifies it by saying the friend has ridden hundreds of times without contributing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the social norms around this. Usually, when someone provides rides repeatedly, especially for friends, it's common for the recipient to cover the cost of gas sometimes, but it's not always expected every time. The key here is that the friend only contributed once when the author forgot their purse. The author then decides the friend should \"find your way around in the future,\" implying they won't offer rides anymore unless the friend covers gas costs.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the friend might have a point if they felt the author is being inconsistent or unfair. But the author is also within their rights to set boundaries. If the author was accommodating rides without expecting payment, it's reasonable to want the friend to contribute when possible. However, cutting off all rides because of a single instance might be seen as harsh, especially if the friend has been relying on those rides regularly.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might feel that the friend isn't appreciative or considerate of their expenses. The fact that the friend put gas once when reminded might not be enough for the author to feel it's fair. The author's request for the friend to find their own way could be seen as a reasonable boundary if they're tired of covering all the costs.\n\nBut there's a nuance here. If the author was okay with the friend not contributing in the past, changing the terms suddenly without prior discussion might come off as a power move or being unfair. The friend might not have realized the author was expecting payment each time. However, the author isn't wrong for setting a boundary. It's their car and their money, so they can decide who pays when.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They have the right to ask for gas money if they want, especially if it's a regular thing. The friend's one-time contribution might not have been enough for the author, and the author is justified in saying they need the friend to handle their own transportation. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
