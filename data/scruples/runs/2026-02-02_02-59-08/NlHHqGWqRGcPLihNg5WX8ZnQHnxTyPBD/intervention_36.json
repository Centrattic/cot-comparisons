      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for ending free rides for their friend. The friend has always taken rides without contributing gas, except once when the author forgot their purse and the friend put in $10 for gas. Now the author is telling the friend to find their own way around.\n\nFirst, the key points here are about fairness and expectations. The friend has been riding for hundreds of times without contributing gas. The author covers all the costs, filling the tank and providing rides. The friend only contributed once, which was a specific instance when the author had forgotten their purse. The author is now ending the rides, which the friend might see as a sudden change in a long-standing arrangement.\n\nThe author's argument is that they're being fair by expecting the friend to contribute their share, especially since the friend benefits from using the car. The friend's argument might be that the occasional contribution was enough or that the author's change in stance is unfair after so long. \n\nIn terms of social norms, it's common for friends to split costs when they're both benefiting. If the author was covering all the gas costs, that could be seen as one-sided. The fact that the friend only contributed once might not be enough. The author's decision to stop the rides could be justified if they feel the arrangement is unfair, especially if they were covering all the costs. However, maybe the author should have addressed this earlier instead of cutting it off suddenly. But given that the friend has used the car many times without contributing, the author might be within their rights to end the arrangement. \n\nSo, considering the situation, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They have a right to set boundaries, especially regarding their personal expenses. The friend's contribution of $10 once isn't enough to balance the hundreds of free rides. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
