      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let's start by breaking down the situation. The author usually gives their friend free rides in their car. The friend always rides with them, and the author fills up the gas for the trips. This past weekend, the friend put $10 in gas because the author forgot their purse at home. Now the author says they told the friend to find their own way around in the future. The question is whether the author is an asshole (AITA) for ending the free rides.\n\nFirst, let's look at the friend's actions. The friend has ridden in the author's car hundreds of times without contributing to gas. Only once did the friend put $10 in gas, which was when the author forgot their purse. The author is now ending the rides because the friend didn't contribute to gas before. \n\nThe key points here are about fairness and expectations. The author might feel that the friend is taking advantage of their generosity by not contributing to the costs of gas. The friend, on the other hand, might not have realized that they were expected to pay for gas, especially since they did it once when asked. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that since the friend didn't pay for gas hundreds of times before, it's unfair to continue giving free rides. The friend only contributed once, which might not be enough in the author's view. The author is now saying the friend should find their own way around. \n\nNow, considering social norms, people often have different expectations. If the author never mentioned the cost of gas before, the friend might not have known to contribute. However, if the author considered it a favor and the friend didn't reciprocate, the author might feel it's time to stop. \n\nBut the fact that the friend did put $10 in gas once might suggest that the author had hinted or mentioned the cost, leading the friend to contribute that time. However, since the friend didn't do it before, the author might feel it's one-time and not consistent. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, if the author never communicated their expectations clearly, then maybe they share some responsibility. But if they felt that the friend was using their car without contributing, ending it makes sense. Friends often have different boundaries, and it's their car and money. The author isn't obligated to provide free rides indefinitely. \n\nThe friend might feel blindsided, but the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for stopping something that they felt was unfair. So the answer would likely be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
