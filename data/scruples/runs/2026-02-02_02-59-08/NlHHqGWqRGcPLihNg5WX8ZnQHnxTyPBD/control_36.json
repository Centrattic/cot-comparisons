      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for ending free rides for their friend. The situation is that the friend often gets rides in the writer's car, and now after one instance of the friend putting gas in the car, the writer ended the rides. The key points here are the frequency and consistency of the friend's contributions.\n\nThe writer mentions that their friend usually doesn't put gas in, but this one time they did. The writer then decided to stop giving rides. The friend has ridden hundreds of times without contributing. The writer's reasoning is that the friend should find their own way around now. \n\nSo, the main question is whether the writer is justified in ending the rides. The friend's one-time gas contribution doesn't balance out the hundreds of times they didn't. The writer is setting boundaries, which is reasonable. If someone is using your resources (like gas) repeatedly without contributing, it's fair to ask them to contribute or stop using them. The writer isn't being unfair because they're not expecting the friend to cover all costs, but just one time isn't enough. Therefore, the writer isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
