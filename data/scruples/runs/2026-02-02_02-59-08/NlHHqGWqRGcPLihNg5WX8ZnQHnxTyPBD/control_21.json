      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong after ending free friend rides in their car. The situation is that the friend often rides with them, and the author fills up the tank. Recently, the friend put $10 in gas because the author forgot their purse. Now the author is saying the friend should find their own way around.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points here. The friend has used the author's car hundreds of times without contributing to gas. This time, after the author forgot their purse, the friend added $10. The author is now ending the rides, and the question is whether that makes them an asshole.\n\nHmm. So the main issue here is about fairness and the expectations in the friendship. The author is probably feeling taken advantage of because the friend has been getting free rides consistently. The fact that the friend only contributed once might not seem like enough in the author's eyes. But the friend might feel that the $10 was a gesture to help out when the author was in a bind.\n\nI need to consider both sides. From the author's perspective, they've been covering all the costs of gas for many rides, which can add up over time. The friend's occasional contribution (even if it's $10) might not balance out the frequent free rides. The author's decision to stop the rides could be seen as standing up for themselves, setting boundaries. That makes sense.\n\nOn the other hand, the friend might have expected that the occasional contribution was enough. If the author is now cutting off all rides because of that, the friend might feel unfairly treated, especially since they did contribute once. But the author probably feels that the friend isn't taking responsibility for their share of the cost.\n\nThe key here is whether the author is being unreasonable. The author's action is to end the rides entirely. If the friend contributed even a little bit, maybe the author could have accepted that as a gesture and continued the rides. But if the author is expecting more consistent contributions, that's a different matter.\n\nAlso, the fact that the friend put $10 in gas when the author needed it might be a point in their favor, showing some willingness to help. However, the author might have expected the friend to contribute more regularly, not just once. The author's request for the friend to \"find your way around\" is a clear boundary, but is it justified?\n\nIn similar situations, people often consider how consistent the contributions are. If the friend had been contributing even a small amount each time, the author might not have felt the need to end the rides. But in this case, the friend only contributed once. That might not be enough for the author, leading them to set a boundary.\n\nAnother angle is about the frequency of the rides. Hundreds of times without contributing, then one time with $10. The author might feel that the friend isn't taking responsibility, so ending the rides is their way of enforcing their own boundaries. That could be seen as reasonable, especially if the author is feeling used.\n\nSo putting it all together, the author is not in the wrong. They're setting a boundary after feeling taken advantage of. The friend's one-time contribution might not be sufficient in the author's view, leading to the decision to stop the rides. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
