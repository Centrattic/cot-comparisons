      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong for ending free friend rides in their car. The friend has been taking rides hundreds of times without contributing to gas, and when the author forgot their purse, the friend put $10 in gas. Then the author said the friend should find their own way around.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author is providing a service (transportation) without compensation, and the friend isn't contributing to the costs. When the author forgot their purse, the friend offered $10, which might have been a gesture of goodwill. But the author then decided to stop offering rides entirely, telling the friend to find their own way. \n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants to know my take. Let me consider the dynamics here. The friend was using the author's car hundreds of times without paying. That's a significant cost on the author's part. Even though the friend put $10 once, that's a small amount compared to the ongoing expense. The author might feel that the friend isn't taking responsibility for their share of the cost, so ending the arrangement makes sense. On the other hand, maybe the author could have asked for gas money from the start instead of waiting until that point. \n\nBut the key here is that the author is the one deciding to stop the rides. The friend isn't obligated to rideshare, but if they were relying on it, the author could have a right to set boundaries. The author might be upset that the friend didn't contribute before, and this was a way to enforce fairness. \n\nIn terms of being an asshole, the author's action is about setting a boundary after a long period of one-sided support. The friend's one-time contribution might not be enough to justify continuing the arrangement. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong because they're taking a stand for their own needs. \n\nAlternatively, some might argue that the author didn't communicate their expectations earlier. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong now. Since they've made their decision, it's about whether that decision is justified. The author isn't forcing the friend to ride, but choosing to stop. That seems fair if they felt taken advantage of. \n\nSo I think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
