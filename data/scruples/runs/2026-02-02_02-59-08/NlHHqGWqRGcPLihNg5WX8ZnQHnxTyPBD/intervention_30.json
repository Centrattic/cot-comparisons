      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for ending free friend rides in their car. The situation is that the friend has been riding in the author's car regularly without contributing to the gas, except once when they put in $10 after the author forgot their purse. The author then told the friend to find their way around in the future.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the expectations in such a friendship. If the author's friend has been riding for hundreds of times without contributing, that might be fair or unfair depending on the context. The friend did contribute once after the author forgot their purse, which might have been a gesture of goodwill. But the author is ending the rides now, possibly because the friend didn't contribute gas money. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The friend might feel that using the author's car is a favor, and contributing gas is part of being considerate. However, the author might feel that this is a one-time gesture, not a regular contribution, and thus not enough. \n\nIf the author didn't explicitly ask for gas money before, maybe the friend assumed it wasn't necessary. However, the author could have set expectations earlier. Ending the rides after one instance of the friend contributing gas might be seen as harsh. On the other hand, the author is within their rights to set boundaries if they feel the arrangement is unfair. \n\nThe key points: The friend has used the car many times without contributing, except once. The author is ending the rides because of that. Whether this is an asshole move depends on if the author's action is reasonable given the situation. If the author is frustrated with the friend not contributing, then ending the rides could be justified. But if the friend was contributing in small ways before, maybe the author is overreacting. \n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the author's action is proportionate. Since the friend only contributed once, and the author is ending the rides now, maybe the author is being reasonable in setting boundaries. Alternatively, if the author never communicated the expectation for gas money, the friend might not have known. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, often the person is in the wrong if they overreact or don't communicate. But here, the author might be setting a boundary after a long period of one-sided usage. So the answer could be B (not in the wrong) because they're asserting their right to set limits. However, if the friend did contribute once as a small gesture, maybe the author is being too strict. Hmm. It's a bit of a toss-up, but leaning towards B since the author is ending the rides to stop future use, which is their prerogative.\n"
