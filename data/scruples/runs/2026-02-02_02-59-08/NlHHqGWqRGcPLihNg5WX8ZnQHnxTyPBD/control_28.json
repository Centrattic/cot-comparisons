      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit-style post is in the wrong for ending free rides for their friend. The situation is that the friend often rides in their car, and the writer covers gas and other costs. This time, the friend put $10 in gas because the writer forgot their purse, and when asked back, the writer said to find their own way around.\n\nFirst, I need to consider typical social expectations. Usually, friends helping each other out is common, but there's a line when it's one-sided. The writer is consistently covering gas and other expenses for the friend's rides. The friend only contributed once when the writer forgot their purse. \n\nThe key point is whether the writer overstepped by stopping the rides. The friend's action of putting in gas was a one-off, and the writer is ending the arrangement. The writer might feel it's unfair since they've been covering costs all along. \n\nIn terms of fairness, if the friend never contributed before, the writer is justified in setting boundaries. The friend's one-time contribution doesn't negate the long-term imbalance. The writer is within their rights to ask the friend to handle their own transportation. \n\nAlso, the phrase \"find your way around\" could be seen as a polite but firm boundary. It's not unreasonable for someone to expect reciprocity or at least acknowledgment of the ongoing cost. The writer isn't being unkind but is asserting their own needs. \n\nSo, the answer would be that the author is not in the wrong (B). They have a right to set boundaries when there's a consistent one-sided arrangement. The friend's single act of contributing once doesn't make the writer's decision to end the rides unfair. The writer is taking responsibility for their own resources and limiting the friend's free ride, which is reasonable.\n"
