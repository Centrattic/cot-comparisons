      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who ended their friend's free rides is in the wrong. The situation is that the friend often rides in their car without contributing to gas, but this time the friend put in $10 for gas when the author forgot their purse. The author then told the friend to find their own way around.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author might feel that the friend should contribute to gas costs, especially given the frequent rides. The friend, on the other hand, might not have seen a need to pay before, especially if it was a one-time gesture this time.\n\nThe key points here are the frequency of the rides and the sudden change in the friend's behavior. The author mentions that the friend has ridden hundreds of times without contributing, but only this time offered $10. The author then decides to stop giving rides altogether. Is this a fair reaction?\n\nI think the author's frustration is understandable. If you're using your own car and resources (gas, insurance, maintenance) for someone else's convenience, expecting some contribution makes sense. However, the way the author ended it by saying the friend should find their own way might come off as abrupt. Maybe the author could have discussed setting a rule about gas contributions earlier on, instead of cutting off rides after a single instance.\n\nBut the friend did make an effort this time, which could indicate they realized the author's expense. The author's response, however, might be seen as punishing the friend for past actions rather than addressing it constructively. It's possible the author is overreacting because they didn't set clear expectations from the start. \n\nAlternatively, the author is within their rights to set boundaries, especially if they feel taken advantage of. The friend's occasional contribution wasn't enough to make up for hundreds of free rides. So, maybe the author isn't in the wrong for ending the rides, but they could have handled it more gracefully by communicating their expectations earlier.\n\nIn terms of whether it's an asshole move, the answer hinges on whether the author had a chance to address the issue before this incident. Since there's no mention of prior discussion, the author might be justified in setting a boundary now. However, ending all rides after one instance could be seen as harsh. There's a balance between being reasonable and being entitled. If the author had a conversation first, it might have been handled better. But as it stands, the author is taking a stand, which isn't necessarily wrong.\n"
