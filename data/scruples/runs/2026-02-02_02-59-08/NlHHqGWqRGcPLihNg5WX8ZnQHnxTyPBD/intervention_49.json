      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for ending free rides for their friend. The situation is that the friend often rides with them, and when the author forgot their purse, the friend put $10 in gas to return it. The author then decided to tell the friend to find their own way around from now on. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics here. The friend has been getting rides regularly without contributing to gas. The author provides transportation, filling up the tank, and picking the friend up and dropping them off. The friend's act of putting $10 in gas once, when the author forgot their purse, is the trigger for the author ending the arrangement.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is justified in stopping the rides. The author might feel that the friend is taking advantage of their generosity, especially since the friend has done this many times without contributing. The friend's one-time contribution might not be enough to rectify the imbalance. On the other hand, the friend might feel that they only didn't help before because they didn't think of it, or maybe they didn't have the means earlier. But since they did contribute once, maybe the author could have found a middle ground, like asking for a small contribution rather than cutting things off completely.\n\nThe author's decision to end the rides entirely might be seen as harsh. Instead of an all-or-nothing approach, perhaps setting a boundary where the friend needs to contribute a certain amount each time could be more reasonable. Ending the rides might affect the friend's ability to get around, especially if they rely on it. However, the author is also within their rights to set boundaries regarding their personal car and expenses.\n\nAnother angle: the friend's action of putting $10 in gas was in response to the author forgetting the purse. That might have been a one-time gesture of goodwill, but the author is now ending the arrangement, which could be seen as a reaction to the friend finally contributing once after many instances of not doing so. The author might feel that the friend should have contributed all along, not just once.\n\nIn terms of fairness, if the friend has been using the car for hundreds of rides without contributing, the author's frustration is understandable. However, cutting off transportation entirely might be an extreme response. A more balanced approach could be to communicate the expectation that the friend should contribute to gas costs moving forward, rather than ending the rides completely. That way, the author sets a boundary while still offering the ride, and the friend gets a chance to meet the new terms.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author might be in the right to set a boundary, but the method of ending the rides entirely might be too harsh. However, since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, the answer could hinge on whether their reaction is proportionate. If the author is now holding the friend accountable for all past rides, it might be a fair stance, but ending the arrangement entirely without giving the friend a chance to start contributing moving forward could be seen as harsh. Alternatively, the author's decision to stop the rides could be justified as a way to enforce their own terms from now on, given the friend's past behavior.\n\nI think the key here is that the author is setting a boundary, which is reasonable. However, the abruptness of cutting off the rides without prior discussion might be the issue. If the author had asked the friend to contribute from the start or discussed gas costs earlier, it might have been better. But since they didn't, ending it now might be seen as the author being in the right to enforce terms they should have set from the beginning. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
