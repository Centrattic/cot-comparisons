      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for ending free friend rides. The situation is that the friend often rides in their car, and the writer fills up the gas. This time, the friend put $10 in gas because the writer forgot their purse at home, and after that, the writer told the friend to find their own way around.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is an asshole here. The choices are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The friend has used the car many times without contributing to gas. This time, he put $10 in gas because the writer left their purse. The writer is now saying the friend should find his own way. \n\nThe key points here are about fairness and reciprocity. The friend usually doesn't pay, but this time he did. The writer might feel that since the friend didn't pay before, this $10 is just making up for past rides. Or maybe the writer is annoyed that the friend didn't pay before and now is trying to contribute. But the writer is ending the rides entirely. \n\nIs the writer in the wrong? Well, if the friend was never expected to pay gas before, the writer might be setting a precedent by asking for it now. However, the friend did put $10 in gas this time. The writer could have accepted that and continued rides. But instead, they said to find their own way. \n\nIt might come down to whether the writer is being unreasonable in ending all rides after this one instance. The friend might have just started contributing now, so the writer cutting off rides could be seen as overreacting. But if the writer felt that the friend never contributed before and this was a one-time thing, maybe they're justified in not wanting to continue the rides. \n\nAnother angle is that the writer is the car owner and has the right to set boundaries. If they decided they don't want to give rides anymore, that's their choice. However, the friend might have expected that the $10 was sufficient. \n\nIn AITA posts, people often feel wronged when someone changes the rules. If the friend wasn't required to pay before, the writer might be seen as being unfair by ending the rides now. Alternatively, the writer could argue that they're tired of covering all the costs and want to stop. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be B (No, the writer is not in the wrong) because they have the right to set their boundaries, especially if they felt the friend wasn't contributing. But some might argue that the friend was trying to help this time, so the writer is being harsh. But since the friend had a history of not paying, maybe the writer is justified in ending the rides.\n"
