      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for ending free rides. The situation is that the author's friend has been taking rides in their car a lot, and the author fills up the gas. This time, the friend put $10 in gas because the author forgot their purse, and the friend asked them back for it. The author then says the friend should find their own way around in the future. The question is whether the author is an asshole (AITA) for that.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the details. The friend has taken hundreds of rides without contributing to gas. This time, the friend did put $10 in gas, but the author is upset and decided to stop giving rides. The friend perhaps expected that since they usually ride for free, they don't have to pay now, but they did. The author is now telling the friend to find their own way. \n\nSo, the core issue is about fairness. The author is covering gas costs each time, which can add up. The friend never paid before but this time did. The author might feel that the friend should always have been paying, or that this is the first time they're being asked to return the favor, which is a new expectation. The author is ending the rides, possibly because they're tired of covering all the costs. \n\nBut the friend in this case did put gas in, maybe as a gesture, and then asked the author back for it. The author could be annoyed because the friend is now bringing it up, which might imply that they feel it's their responsibility. The author's response is to stop giving rides. \n\nNow, whether the author is in the wrong. If the author always assumed the friend would pay for gas, but the friend never did, then the author might be justified in setting boundaries. However, if it was an unspoken agreement that the author would cover gas, and the friend didn't do anything, then the author could be within their rights to end it. On the other hand, the friend putting $10 in gas and asking the author back for it might be a way to reciprocate, but the author is now cutting off the rides. \n\nThe key here is the prior agreement. If there was no agreement and the author expected the friend to pay for gas all along, then the friend might be in the wrong for not paying. But if the author didn't set clear expectations and the friend just assumed it was a free ride, then the author might be in the wrong for not clarifying earlier. \n\nThe author's statement \"Am I an asshole for saying find your way around in the future?\" suggests they might feel guilty. But if they're covering gas each time and the friend never contributes, that's a lot of expenses. The friend's action of putting $10 in gas and asking back could be an attempt to be fair, but it's the first time. The author's response is to stop the rides. \n\nIn most cases, people might expect that if you take someone's car, you contribute to gas, especially if it's a regular thing. The fact that the friend has done it hundreds of times without paying is a problem. The author is now setting a boundary after the friend tried to reciprocate once. \n\nBut maybe the author was being generous all along, and the friend never contributed. The author is not being mean about it; they just stopped the rides. So the answer would likely be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they're setting a boundary after repeated use without contribution. The friend should have been paying for gas from the start. The author's action is about fairness and their own costs.\n"
