      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who ended free rides in their car is in the wrong. The situation is that the friend has been taking rides regularly, and the author only asked for gas money once when they forgot their purse. Now they're telling the friend to find their own way around.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend has used the car hundreds of times without contributing to gas, which might have been an unspoken understanding at first. But when the author forgot their purse, the friend put in $10 for gas. Now the author is ending the rides, possibly because they feel taken advantage of after so many free rides.\n\nThe key points here are the frequency of the free rides versus the one instance where the friend contributed. The author might feel that the friend should have contributed more consistently, not just once when reminded. On the other hand, the friend might have thought it was a one-time thing or didn't realize they were supposed to contribute every time.\n\nLegally and morally, there's no law against offering rides, so the friend isn't obligated to pay. However, social norms often dictate that if someone asks for gas money, it's polite to contribute. Since the author hasn't consistently asked before, the friend might not have known it was expected. The author's sudden decision to stop the rides could be seen as a reaction to the imbalance, but maybe the friend didn't realize the author wanted payment each time.\n\nIs the author justified in ending the rides? They have the right to decide who rides with them and under what conditions. After many free rides, the author is within their rights to change the terms. The friend might feel it's unfair, but the author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries after realizing the ongoing cost. However, some might argue that the author should have communicated the expectation of gas money earlier rather than ending it abruptly. But since the friend only contributed once, the author's frustration is understandable.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong for ending the rides. They have the right to adjust their behavior based on their comfort and the perceived fairness of the arrangement. The friend's lack of consistent contribution likely played a role in the author's decision.\n"
