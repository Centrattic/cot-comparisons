      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for ending free rides for their friend. The situation is that the friend always rides in their car, and this time, when the writer forgot their purse at home, the friend put $10 in gas. Then the writer said the friend should find their way around in the future. The options are A for yes, they're wrong, and B for no.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The friend has been taking rides hundreds of times without contributing to gas. This time, after the writer forgot their purse, the friend put $10 in gas. Then the writer ends the rides, telling the friend to find their own way. The question is whether the writer is an asshole here.\n\nSo, from the writer's perspective, they might feel that they've been doing all the work\u2014filling up gas, picking up and dropping off the friend. The friend never contributed before, so this one instance of putting $10 might not be enough. The writer could feel it's unfair that the friend only helps out once after so many times of free rides. They might think that the friend isn't appreciative and that it's time to stop the arrangement.\n\nFrom the friend's perspective, maybe they didn't realize that their actions were expected in the past. They might have just done the $10 as a gesture of goodwill, not understanding that it's a recurring contribution. Alternatively, the friend might feel that putting $10 was a fair gesture and expects the writer to appreciate it.\n\nNow, considering social norms and fairness. If someone is using another's resources repeatedly without contributing, it's reasonable for the provider to expect some contribution, especially if it's causing them financial burden. The writer is setting a boundary here. The friend's one-time contribution might not be sufficient if the rides continue. The writer might be within their rights to end the arrangement, especially if they feel the friend hasn't been contributing fairly.\n\nAlso, the writer might have built up frustration over time. The friend's past behavior of not contributing could have led to resentment. The writer's response is a way to address that imbalance. However, maybe the friend didn't realize the expectation. But the writer hasn't communicated their expectations clearly before, so perhaps that's part of the issue.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, people often are in the right if they're setting boundaries after long-term one-sided arrangements. The key factors here are communication and reciprocity. If the writer never asked for contributions before and the friend didn't know they were expected, maybe the writer should have communicated that. But given that the friend only contributed once after hundreds of times, the writer's frustration is understandable.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would likely be B (No), the author is not in the wrong. They're setting a boundary after unfair use of their resources. The friend's one-time contribution doesn't offset the ongoing use, so the writer is justified in ending the arrangement.\n"
