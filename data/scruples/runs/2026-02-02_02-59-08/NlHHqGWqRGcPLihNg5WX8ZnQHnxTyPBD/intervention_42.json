      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for ending free friend rides. The situation is that the friend often rides in their car, and the author fills up the gas. This time, the friend put $10 in gas because the author forgot their purse. The author then told the friend to find their own way around. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the scenario. The key points are that the friend has used the author's car hundreds of times without contributing to gas, and this time they put $10 in. The author is upset and decided to stop giving rides. \n\nThe user's initial thought is that the author is wrong. But maybe I should consider both sides. On one hand, the friend didn't contribute before, so putting $10 now might be a gesture, but it's a small amount. The author is frustrated after many instances. On the other hand, the friend might have felt guilty and tried to help, but maybe the author felt that it's not enough. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong by ending the rides. If the friend never contributed before and the author is now cutting off all rides, is that fair? The author has the right to set boundaries, especially if they feel taken advantage of. However, the friend's one-time contribution might have been a sign of trying to help, so the author's reaction could be seen as harsh. \n\nAlternatively, if the author had a problem with the friend not contributing gas money, maybe they should have addressed it earlier instead of ending all rides after one instance. The author's action might be justified if they felt it was a one-sided arrangement. But the friend did make an effort this time, which the author might not have acknowledged. \n\nHmmm. Maybe the author isn't in the wrong because they have the right to decide who uses their car and under what terms. However, ending all future rides might be an overreaction if the friend was trying to make amends. But if the author is tired of the friend always taking without giving, it's reasonable to set a boundary. \n\nI think the friend's action of putting $10 in gas was a positive step, but maybe not enough. The author might have expected more or wanted the friend to contribute every time. Since the author is ending the rides, the question is whether that's fair. \n\nIn \"AITA\" posts, people often get called out for overreacting. But sometimes the person is justified in setting boundaries. Here, the author is ending the rides because the friend didn't pay gas before. The friend's one-time contribution might not be sufficient for the author to continue. \n\nSo, the answer could be B (author not in the wrong) because they are setting a boundary after repeated use without contribution. The friend's single act of putting gas might not outweigh the history. The author has the right to decide who uses their car and how.\n"
