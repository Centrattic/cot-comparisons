      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for ending free rides for their friend. The situation is that the friend often rides in their car without contributing to gas, but once put in $10 when the author forgot their purse and later asked for it back. Then the author told the friend to find their own way around.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points here. The author has been giving their friend rides regularly, and the friend hasn't contributed to gas before. The one time the friend did put $10 in gas was after the author forgot their purse and the friend returned it. Now the author is saying the friend should find their own way, and the question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate that. So, from the author's perspective, they might feel that the friend is taking advantage by not contributing to gas costs. The friend's action of putting $10 in once might be seen as a one-time gesture, but the author is ending the rides entirely. \n\nOn the other hand, the friend might have expected that occasional contributions aren't necessary, and the author is being strict about it. The friend might not have the same expectation of contributing gas money every time. The author's response of stopping all rides could be seen as disproportionate if the issue was just about the one time the friend contributed gas money.\n\nBut maybe the author is justified if they feel that the friend should have been contributing all along. If the author is covering all the gas costs, it's fair to expect some contribution, especially if it's a frequent occurrence. The friend putting in $10 once might not be enough, so the author is setting a boundary by saying no more rides.\n\nHowever, the way the author handled it might be the problem. Instead of ending the rides completely, maybe they could have discussed contributing gas money regularly. Ending all rides might be too harsh, especially if the friend had been doing this for a long time without issue. The one time the friend tried to help, the author is ending it, which could be seen as unfair.\n\nI need to consider social norms here. In many cases, friends might ride each other's cars without expecting payment unless it's a significant expense. The author might be overreacting if the friend wasn't aware that contributions were expected. The author's action of stopping all rides could be seen as harsh, even if the friend should have contributed more.\n\nSo, weighing both sides, the author might be in the wrong for overreacting and not addressing the issue more constructively. The friend's one-time gesture might not be enough to justify ending all rides, especially if the author never communicated the expectation for regular contributions. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
