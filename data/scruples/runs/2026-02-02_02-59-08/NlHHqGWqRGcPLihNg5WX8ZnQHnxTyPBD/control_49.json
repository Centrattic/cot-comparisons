      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The situation is about ending free friend rides.\n\nSo, the friend has been riding in the author's car hundreds of times without contributing to the gas. Recently, the author forgot their purse, and the friend put $10 in gas as repayment. Then the author told the friend to find their own way around in the future. The question is whether the author is an asshole for ending the free rides.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend has been using the author's car frequently without paying for gas. Gas is a recurring cost, and the author is the one bearing it. The friend only contributed once when the author forgot their purse. The author's request to stop the rides is about their own resources and boundaries.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, it's reasonable to expect that sharing a ride might involve some shared costs, especially over time. The friend not contributing except once could be seen as taking advantage. The author is setting a boundary, which is their right. They might feel that the friend hasn't been fair in sharing the cost, so ending it now is justified.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the friend assumed it was a casual ride and didn't think about the gas. They might not have realized the financial impact. However, the author's point is that the friend didn't contribute except once, which is a small amount compared to the hundreds of times they rode.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the author is not obligated to provide rides for free. If the friend wanted a ride, perhaps they should have offered to pay from the start. The author is now asserting their right to stop the rides, especially since the friend hasn't consistently contributed. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer is probably B.\n"
