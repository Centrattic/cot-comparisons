      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for ending free rides for their friend. The situation is that the friend has been riding in their car a lot, and the author fills up the gas. This time, the friend put $10 into gas because the author forgot their purse at home. The author then told the friend to find their own way around.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are: the friend has used the car hundreds of times without contributing to gas before. Now, only this one time, the friend put gas money in. The author is upset about that and decided to stop giving rides. The question is whether the author is an asshole for doing so.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the expectations. If the author always pays for gas and the friend never contributes, that's a pattern. The friend's contribution this time might be a small gesture, but maybe the author feels it's not enough. The author might feel that since the friend never contributed before, this one time isn't making up for the hundreds of times they didn't. So the author might be frustrated that the friend isn't taking responsibility for the costs.\n\nOn the other hand, the friend might have thought that putting gas in this time was a way to help, even if it wasn't the same as paying for all rides. But the author is now ending the rides entirely. Is that fair? Well, maybe the author feels that the friend isn't sharing the cost, so it's unfair. The author has the right to set boundaries. If the friend isn't contributing, the author can choose to stop the rides. However, the friend did put gas in this time, which could be seen as a small effort. But the author might feel that it's not enough, especially since the friend didn't do it before.\n\nAnother angle: maybe the author is being a bit harsh. The friend did make an effort this time, so cutting off completely might be overreacting. But the author has a right to expect some contribution if they're providing a service. It's about fairness. If the friend is using the car a lot and the author is covering all costs, it's reasonable for the author to ask for some help with gas. If the friend refuses, the author can stop. In this case, the friend did put gas in once, but the author might still feel that it's not enough compared to the previous times.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, if the author feels that the friend isn't contributing fairly, then ending the rides isn't wrong. The friend might not be expected to put gas in every time, but maybe a monthly contribution or some arrangement. Since the friend only did it once, the author might be justified in stopping. On the other hand, if the author is now ending all rides because of one instance, maybe that's a bit abrupt. But considering the history, the author might feel that one time isn't enough to make up for the rest. \n\nI think the key here is whether the author communicated their expectations. If the author never asked for contributions before, the friend might not have known. But if the author is upset about the lack of contribution, then it's their right to stop. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
