      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for ending free rides for their friend. \n\nFirst, the situation: The friend often rides in their car for free, the writer fills up the gas and picks them up. Last time, the friend put $10 in gas because the writer forgot their purse. Then the friend asked for it back. The writer then told the friend to find their own way. The question is whether the writer is an asshole for doing that.\n\nSo, the key points here are about fairness and expectations. The writer has been covering gas costs consistently, and the friend hasn't contributed before. This time, the friend put in $10, but then asked for it back. The writer is upset because the friend is now not contributing and is even getting money back. \n\nI think that the writer has a right to be upset. They've been shouldering all the costs, and the friend's action of putting $10 might have been a one-time thing. But then asking for it back seems like the friend is not taking responsibility for their usual share. The writer is ending the rides because they feel it's unfair that the friend isn't contributing. \n\nBut maybe the friend's action of putting gas was just a gesture, and expecting it to be returned isn't fair? Or maybe the writer is overreacting because the friend usually doesn't contribute. Alternatively, maybe the writer should have discussed this earlier instead of ending it suddenly. \n\nWait, but the friend has ridden hundreds of times without contributing. The $10 was a single instance. So the writer is saying that since the friend isn't consistently helping, they'll stop giving rides. That seems reasonable. The friend might have thought that putting $10 was enough, but the writer is asking for consistent contribution, not just a one-time thing. \n\nAlso, the friend asking for the $10 back could be seen as not acknowledging the writer's effort. So the writer's decision to stop rides might be justified because the friend isn't taking responsibility. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), the author is not in the wrong. They have a valid reason to expect some contribution from their friend, especially after so many free rides. The friend's request for the money back after a single contribution shows they don't take it seriously. The writer is setting a boundary, which is reasonable.\n"
