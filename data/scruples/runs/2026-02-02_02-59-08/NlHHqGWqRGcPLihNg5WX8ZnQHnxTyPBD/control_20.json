The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for ending free friend rides.\n\nThe situation is that the author's friend rides in their car regularly without contributing to gas costs. The friend only put gas in once when the author forgot their purse, but the author is now telling the friend to find their own way. \n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author overstepped. The friend has a history of not contributing, and the one time they did was situational (the author forgot their purse). The author is asserting their right to not have the friend take advantage, which seems reasonable. \n\nThe friend might feel entitled, but the author isn't obligated to provide rides. The key here is whether ending the rides is unfair. Since the friend hasn't consistently contributed, the author isn't in the wrong. So the answer should be B.\n"
