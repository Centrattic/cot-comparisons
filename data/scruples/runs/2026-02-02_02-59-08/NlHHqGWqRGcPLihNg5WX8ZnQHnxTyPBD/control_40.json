      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for ending free friend rides. The situation is that the friend always rides with them, the author fills the gas tank, picks the friend up, and drops them off. The friend only contributed $10 in gas once when the author forgot their purse and asked for it back. The author then told the friend to find their own way around.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The key points are the repeated behavior of the friend using the car without contributing, and the one-time exception where the friend did contribute. The author is ending the rides, which is their right, but the question is whether they're in the wrong for doing so.\n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, if the friend has consistently not contributed and only did so once when asked, it's reasonable for the author to feel that the balance isn't fair. Gas is a recurring cost, and the friend isn't sharing the expense. The author might have felt it's their responsibility to cover the gas, but maybe they wanted the friend to contribute sometimes. The friend's behavior could be seen as taking advantage, especially since there's a pattern of not contributing except when caught or asked.\n\nIn terms of social norms, friends often split costs, especially when it's a regular thing. If the author didn't communicate the expectation of contribution earlier, maybe that's on them. However, the friend didn't offer to help with gas otherwise, so the author might not be obligated to keep giving free rides. The author's decision to stop the rides is a boundary, which is acceptable if they felt it was necessary for fairness.\n\nThe friend might see it as a minor issue, but the cumulative cost over hundreds of rides could add up. The author had the right to set boundaries, and ending the rides isn't necessarily inconsiderate if it's due to the friend not contributing. However, if the author never discussed this before, maybe they should have addressed it earlier. But since they did address it once, and the friend didn't continue the contribution, the author's response seems justified.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. They're asserting their right to have shared costs and setting a boundary. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
