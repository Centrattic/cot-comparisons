      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for ending free rides for their friend. The situation is that the friend has taken rides in the author's car many times without contributing to gas, except once when they put in $10. The author is now telling the friend to find their own way around.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend has been using the author's car regularly without paying for gas except for that one time. So, the author is ending the arrangement by saying the friend should find their own way. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate this.\n\nThe key points here are about fairness and mutual expectations. When someone regularly uses another's car for rides, there's an implicit agreement, even if it's not explicit. If the friend has never contributed except once, maybe the author is justified in feeling taken advantage of. On the other hand, maybe the friend didn't realize the expectation of contributing, especially if it was never discussed.\n\nBut in many cases, if someone uses your car, they might expect to help with gas. If the author has been the one covering all the costs, ending the ride-sharing makes sense. The friend's one-time contribution might not be enough if the rides are frequent. The author isn't being hostile but setting a boundary. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong here. However, there's also the aspect of communication. If the author never mentioned expecting gas contributions, maybe the friend didn't know. But if the author expected it, then it's reasonable to stop.\n\nSo, the answer might lean towards B (the author is not in the wrong) because they are setting a boundary after being used. But I need to make sure there's no nuance I'm missing. Since the author is ending the arrangement after the friend's one-time help, maybe the friend's action was just a token effort, and the author is rightfully ending it. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
