      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the AITA question is in the wrong for ending free rides for their friend. The friend has used the author's car many times without contributing to gas, but this time put $10 in when the author forgot their purse. The author then told the friend to find their own way around.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend has been using the car frequently without contributing to gas costs. The author is covering all the expenses, which might be a point of contention. The friend's action of putting $10 in gas once might not be enough to make up for the hundreds of times they rode for free. The author is asserting their right to set boundaries, especially since they're the one paying for the gas and maintenance.\n\nOn the other hand, the friend might feel that the $10 was a gesture of goodwill. But if the author is consistently covering all costs, it's reasonable for them to expect some contribution. The key here is whether the author is being fair in ending the rides. The author isn't being mean about it; they're just setting a boundary. The friend's one-time gesture doesn't change the fact that they didn't contribute before. So, the author isn't being inconsiderate; they're standing up for their own resources. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
