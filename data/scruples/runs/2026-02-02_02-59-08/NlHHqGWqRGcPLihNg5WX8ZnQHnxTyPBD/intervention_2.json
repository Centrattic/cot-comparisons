      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong for ending free rides for their friend. The situation is that the friend has ridden in their car hundreds of times without contributing to gas, but this time after a minor incident where the friend added $10 to the gas, the author told them to find their own way.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The friend has been taking rides regularly without paying for gas. The author is covering all the gas costs, which could be a significant expense over time. The friend once added $10 when the author forgot their purse, but that's just a single instance. The author then decides to stop giving rides, leading the friend to ask for the $10 back. The author's response was to tell the friend to find their own way. \n\nNow, considering social norms and expectations. Friends helping each other out is common, but there's a line when one person is consistently taking without giving back. The friend's behavior of not contributing to gas might be seen as taking advantage. The author's decision to stop rides could be seen as standing up for themselves, especially since the friend didn't contribute before and only did so once when the author was in a vulnerable position (forgetting their purse). \n\nHowever, the author's response of telling the friend to find their own way might be abrupt. Maybe a better approach would be to set clear boundaries earlier, like asking the friend to contribute to gas costs. But since the author didn't do that and allowed the friend to ride for hundreds of times without payment, the friend might not have realized it was expected. \n\nThe friend's request for their $10 back after the author ended the rides could be seen as a point of contention. The author might feel justified in ending the rides but the friend might feel wronged by being asked for the money back. \n\nIn terms of fairness, the author is not wrong for setting a boundary after the friend finally contributed, but maybe the timing or the way it was handled could be questioned. However, the author's primary issue was the friend not paying for gas over time, so the decision to stop rides is a self-preservation step. \n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They are taking a stand after repeated one-sided favors. The friend might be at fault for not contributing until a specific instance. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
