      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for ending free rides. The situation is that the friend has been taking rides in the author's car for a long time, without contributing to gas. The author mentions that the friend put in $10 for gas once when the author forgot their purse, but that's it. The author then told the friend to find their own way around.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The friend has been a regular rider, which implies some kind of unspoken agreement. The author might feel taken advantage of, especially if they're covering all the gas costs. The friend's one-time $10 contribution might not have been enough to cover the cost of all those rides. \n\nBut then, is the author in the wrong for ending the rides? Well, the friend hasn't been contributing much, so the author is probably just setting boundaries. The author isn't forcing the friend to ride with them; they're choosing to stop offering the service without obligation. In many cases, people might understand if you decide to stop letting someone ride with you if they aren't contributing. \n\nHowever, the way the author phrased their question might matter. They said \"find your way around in the future,\" which sounds abrupt. But the main issue is whether they're in the wrong. If the author never explicitly said the rides were free, maybe the friend assumed they were. But the author is within their rights to stop allowing rides if they feel the arrangement isn't fair. \n\nAnother angle: the friend might have relied on these rides for transportation. If the author's decision leaves the friend without a reliable way to get around, that could be seen as harsh. But the author isn't responsible for the friend's transportation needs unless there's a prior agreement. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They're setting a boundary after feeling used. The answer should be B.\n"
