      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) post is in the wrong for ending free rides to their friend. The situation is that the author's friend has been using their car for rides many times without contributing to gas, except once when the author forgot their purse and the friend put $10 in gas later. The author then told the friend to find their own way around.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points here. The friend has been a regular rider, using the car hundreds of times without paying for gas. The only time they contributed was this one instance when the author forgot their purse. The author is now ending the rides, and the question is whether that makes them the asshole.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but they want the AI's opinion. The options are A (yes, author is wrong) or B (no, not wrong).\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, if someone is using another's car regularly, contributing to gas is a common courtesy. The friend never did this except once, which might be seen as taking advantage. However, the author is ending the rides abruptly, which could be seen as harsh. The friend might have expected some communication first or a gradual change. But the author has the right to set boundaries regarding their personal property (the car). \n\nThe key here is whether the friend's one-time contribution was a genuine effort to help out, or if it was just in response to a mistake. The author might feel that the friend never took initiative to help before, so this one time isn't enough. Ending the rides is about enforcing personal boundaries, which is reasonable. However, the friend might feel blindsided, as they were used to free rides without prior discussion. \n\nSo, considering both sides, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They have a right to their own transportation and can decide who uses it. The friend's lack of contribution is an issue, and the author is correcting that by stopping the rides. The abruptness might be a point against the author, but the core issue is about setting boundaries. Therefore, the answer would likely be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
