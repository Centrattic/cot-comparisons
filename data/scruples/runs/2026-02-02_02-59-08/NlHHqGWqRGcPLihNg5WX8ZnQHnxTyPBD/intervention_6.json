      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for ending free rides. The friend has been getting rides in the author's car hundreds of times without contributing gas money, except once when the author forgot their purse. The author then told the friend to find their own way around.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author has been driving the friend regularly, covering gas costs each time. The friend never offered to help with gas except once when the author forgot their purse. The author is now ending the rides, asking the friend to find their own way. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but the question is whether that's accurate.\n\nThe key points here are about fairness and expectations. The friend probably expected the rides to be free, given the author's previous behavior. The author might feel it's unfair to cover all the gas costs alone. On the other hand, the friend hasn't contributed much, which could make the author feel taken advantage of.\n\nIn the AITA community, people often consider whether actions are reasonable. Ending something when it's becoming a burden or a one-sided favor can be seen as justified. The author might have felt it's time to stop, especially if they were paying for gas every time. The fact that the friend only once contributed gas might not be enough to change the dynamic.\n\nBut could the author have addressed it differently? Maybe by having a conversation earlier instead of ending it abruptly. However, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong, not about the approach. Since the author is setting boundaries after consistent one-sided use, it's likely they're not in the wrong. The answer might be B (No).\n"
