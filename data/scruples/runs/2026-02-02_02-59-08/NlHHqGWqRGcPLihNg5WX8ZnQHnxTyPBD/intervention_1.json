      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for ending free friend rides. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nThe author's friend always rides in their car, and they handle the gas. The author fills up the tank and picks up the friend, drops them off. Recently, the friend put $10 in gas because the author forgot their purse at home and asked back for it. The friend has ridden hundreds of times without putting gas in. The author now says \"find your way around in the future,\" meaning they're ending the free rides. The question is whether the author is an asshole here.\n\nFirst, let's break down the key points. The author's friend has been getting free rides for a long time, contributing nothing to the gas. Then, once, the friend put $10 in gas when asked. Now the author is ending the rides. The author is asking if they're in the wrong.\n\nI think the main issue here is about fairness and reciprocity. The friend has been using the author's car and gas without contributing, except once. The author is now ending the arrangement. Is that fair?\n\nOn one hand, the author is within their rights to set boundaries. They're not obligated to give free rides. If they decide they don't want to continue, they can. The friend might have taken advantage, expecting free rides without contributing. The author's request for the $10 is reasonable, especially if they're covering the cost of gas. If the friend only contributed once, maybe the author feels it's not enough, leading them to stop.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might be overreacting. The friend did contribute $10 once. Maybe the author should have communicated earlier about the cost or set expectations from the start. Ending the rides abruptly could be seen as harsh if there was no prior discussion about gas costs. Also, the friend might rely on the author for transportation, so cutting ties without alternatives could be inconvenient.\n\nBut considering that the author is the one providing the service (transportation), they have the right to end it. The friend's contribution was minimal compared to the long-term use. The author might be asserting their boundaries, which is healthy. However, the way they ended it might come off as abrupt. Maybe a more polite explanation would help.\n\nThe key here is whether the author's action is justified. Since the author is the one providing the resource (car and gas), they can decide to stop. The friend's occasional contribution doesn't negate the previous use. So the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They're protecting their own resources and setting a boundary. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
