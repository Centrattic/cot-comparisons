      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) question is in the wrong for ending free rides for their friend. The situation is that the friend has been riding in their car hundreds of times without contributing to gas. This time, the friend put $10 into gas because the author forgot their purse, and later when the author needed the money back, the friend asked for it back. The author then told the friend to find their own way around.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the expectations in a friendship. The friend using the car regularly without contributing might be seen as taking advantage, especially if it's a consistent thing. The user here points out that the friend only contributed once when reminded (the $10 gas) and then later asked for the money back. That seems a bit inconsistent. If the friend only put in gas when they had to, maybe they didn't take responsibility for the cost before.\n\nThe author ending the rides could be seen as asserting their own needs. They might be tired of the one-sided arrangement. Friends should ideally support each other, but if one person is shouldering all the costs, it's reasonable to set boundaries. The author isn't wrong for wanting to stop unless there's a prior agreement that the friend would always contribute. Since there's no mention of such an agreement, the author's action is about protecting their own resources.\n\nOn the flip side, maybe the friend didn't realize the impact of their actions. But the author has to communicate expectations. If they never asked for contributions before, the friend might not have known. However, since they've done this hundreds of times, it's fair to expect some contribution, especially if it's a financial burden. The author's frustration is valid, and setting a boundary isn't being an asshole. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
