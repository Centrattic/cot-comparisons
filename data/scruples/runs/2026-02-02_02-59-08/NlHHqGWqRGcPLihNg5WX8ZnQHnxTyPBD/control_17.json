      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for ending free friend rides. \n\nThe situation is that the friend often rides in the author's car, with the author filling up the gas. This time, the author forgot their purse at home, so the friend put $10 in gas as a repayment. The author then told the friend to find their own way around. The friend has used the car hundreds of times without contributing to gas before.\n\nFirst, the key points here are: the friend usually doesn't pay for gas, but this time they did. The author is now ending the rides, possibly because the friend didn't pay before. The question is about whether this is fair.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, they might feel that since the friend usually doesn't contribute, the $10 was an exception, and they want to stop the arrangement because it's unfair. However, the friend might feel that paying once doesn't mean they should have to do it every time. \n\nBut the author is ending all future rides, not just when the friend doesn't pay. That might be overreacting because the friend has been using the ride without payment for hundreds of times. So the author is asking the friend to pay for past rides, which isn't how it worked before. The friend paid once, which might not be enough for the author to justify ending the arrangement.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might feel that the friend should have contributed all along, and this is their way of enforcing that. But if the previous arrangement was free rides, changing it after the fact without prior discussion could be seen as unfair to the friend. The friend might not have known that their occasional payment was expected, so the author is holding them to a new standard after the fact.\n\nConsidering typical AITA scenarios, people often get called out for being inflexible or not communicating expectations. The author didn't set clear terms initially, so expecting payment now could be seen as a bait and switch. However, the author is also within their rights to set boundaries about using their car. \n\nBut the key issue is that the author is ending all future rides because of a one-time payment. If the friend had never paid before, the author could have asked for payment earlier. Now, after hundreds of free rides, using a single instance to end the arrangement might be seen as unfair. The author is being inconsistent because they didn't enforce payment before, so holding the friend to it now without prior discussion could be the problem.\n\nTherefore, the author is in the wrong for being inconsistent and not communicating their expectations from the start. They can't retroactively impose a condition that wasn't in place before.\n"
