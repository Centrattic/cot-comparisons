      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for ending free rides for their friend. The situation is that the friend often rides in the author's car without contributing to gas. This time, the friend put in $10 when the author forgot their purse, but the author then told the friend to find their own way around.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the expectations of both parties. The friend has been using the author's car frequently without paying gas, which could be seen as taking advantage. However, the author did offer a ride and might have assumed it was a one-time favor. On the other hand, the friend's action of putting in $10 this time might be an attempt to make up for past rides, but the author is now cutting them off entirely.\n\nThe question is whether the author is justified in ending the arrangement. The key points are: the friend's past behavior, the author's response after the one-time payment, and the expectation of ongoing rides without compensation. The author might feel that since the friend didn't pay before, the $10 is insufficient or late. The friend might feel they're being unfairly cut off after a single gesture.\n\nIn terms of fairness, if the author didn't set clear boundaries before, maybe they are at fault for not addressing the issue earlier. However, the author has the right to set limits on their resources. The friend's past actions suggest they didn't contribute, so the author's decision to stop might be seen as a necessary correction. But the abruptness of cutting off rides after a one-time payment could be seen as harsh. \n\nSo, considering that the author had the right to establish boundaries and the friend's history of not contributing, the author is not necessarily in the wrong. The answer might lean towards B. However, if the author didn't communicate expectations clearly from the start, that's a problem. But the question is about whether the author is in the wrong now. The friend's one-time payment doesn't fix past behavior, so the author's response is about future actions. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
