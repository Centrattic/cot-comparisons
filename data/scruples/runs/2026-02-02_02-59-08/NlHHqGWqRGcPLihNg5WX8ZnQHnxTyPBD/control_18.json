      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about ending free rides for a friend. The friend usually takes rides in the car without contributing to gas, but this time, after the author forgot their purse at home, the friend put $10 in gas. The author then told the friend to find their own way around in the future.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation from both sides. The author is providing a service (transportation) without expecting payment, but there's an implicit understanding or expectation. The friend has used this service many times without contributing, which could be seen as taking advantage. However, the friend did contribute $10 once, which the author might interpret as a sign that they should have expected ongoing contributions. The author's response is to stop offering the rides, which is a clear boundary.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, they might feel that since the friend didn't contribute before, this one instance of $10 was a change in behavior, and thus it's reasonable to expect consistency. The friend's action could be seen as a prompt for the author to enforce a rule. The author is setting a boundary, which is their right. They're not obligated to provide rides for free indefinitely if they choose to stop.\n\nOn the other hand, the friend might have thought that the $10 was a one-time gesture or a thank you for returning the purse. It's possible the friend didn't realize that the author was holding them accountable for all previous rides. However, the author's stance is about setting limits, which is valid. The key here is whether it's fair to expect payment after so many free rides. The author's decision to end the rides might be a reaction to the friend's inconsistency.\n\nIn terms of social norms, friends often help each other, but there's a line when it comes to expecting something for nothing. The author isn't being mean by asking for compensation after the fact, but the sudden change in policy might be harsh. However, since the author is the one offering the rides, they have the authority to set terms. The friend's lack of prior contribution could be seen as a free ride, and the author is correcting that by stopping the rides.\n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't in the wrong because they're enforcing a boundary. The friend's one act of putting gas in might not be enough to justify continued free rides without prior agreement. The author has the right to decide how they want to manage their resources. So the answer is B.\n"
