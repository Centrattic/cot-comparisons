      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for ending free rides for their friend. The scenario is that the friend often rides in their car without contributing to gas, but this time, when the friend put $10 in gas because the writer forgot their purse, the writer ended the rides. The user wants to know if the writer is an asshole (AITA) for doing that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The friend has used the car hundreds of times without contributing to gas. That seems like a recurring situation where the writer is shouldering all the costs. Then, this one time, the friend puts in $10 for gas because the writer forgot their purse. The writer then decides to end the free rides, telling the friend to find their own way around.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, the writer might feel that the friend isn't contributing equally. Even though the friend put in $10 once, it's after hundreds of times without any contribution. The writer might feel that this single gesture isn't enough to make up for the repeated use without payment. On the other hand, the friend might argue that they did contribute this time, but maybe the writer is being too strict by ending it after just one instance.\n\nBut the main issue is whether the writer is in the wrong. The writer has a right to set boundaries regarding their expenses. If they feel that their friend isn't pulling their weight financially, it's reasonable to stop providing the service. The fact that the friend only contributed once after many times could be seen as an attempt to make up for past neglect, but the writer might not see it that way. \n\nHowever, the writer's response to ending the rides completely might be seen as a harsh reaction. Maybe they could have asked the friend to start contributing from that point forward instead of cutting it off entirely. But since the friend had a history of not paying, the writer might have felt it was necessary to set a firm boundary to prevent future exploitation. \n\nIn the context of friendships, reciprocity is important. If one person is always giving without receiving anything in return, it can lead to resentment. The writer's action could be a way to address that imbalance. So, the writer isn't necessarily in the wrong. They're asserting their right to not be taken advantage of. The friend's one-time contribution might not be enough to justify continuing the arrangement, especially if the writer has consistently covered all costs before.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong. They have the right to set boundaries and expect contributions for shared expenses.\n"
