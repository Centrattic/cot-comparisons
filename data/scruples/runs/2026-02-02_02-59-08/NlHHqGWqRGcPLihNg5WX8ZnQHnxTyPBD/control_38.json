      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for ending free friend rides. The situation is that the writer's friend always rides with them, and the writer fills up the gas. This time, the friend put in $10 for gas because the writer forgot their purse, and then later asked for it back. The writer is asking if they're an asshole for telling the friend to find their own way around from now on.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The friend has ridden with the writer many times, and up until this point, hasn't contributed to gas. The writer might feel that they've been covering all the costs, which is fair. The friend adding $10 this time might be a small gesture, but the writer's reaction is to stop giving rides entirely. \n\nIs the writer in the wrong? Let's break it down. The friend's action of putting in $10 could be seen as a one-time thing because the writer was short on cash. Maybe the friend felt guilty or wanted to help out. However, the writer might have been used to the arrangement where the friend didn't contribute, and now this small amount is making them end the rides. \n\nThe key points here are expectations and communication. If the writer never mentioned that they expected the friend to help with gas, then expecting the friend to contribute might be unfair. On the other hand, if the writer felt that the arrangement was one-sided, they might have a valid reason to set boundaries. \n\nBut the friend's action here was a one-time thing, not a regular contribution. The writer is now cutting off rides entirely because of this small gesture. That might come off as harsh. The friend might not have the means to contribute regularly, or perhaps didn't realize that the writer expected ongoing contributions. \n\nIn terms of fairness, the writer might have been covering all the costs up till now, and expecting the friend to take responsibility for transportation. However, instead of addressing the issue with the friend, like discussing gas costs, the writer decided to stop rides abruptly. That could be seen as a sudden change without prior communication, which might hurt the friend or make the friend feel unappreciated. \n\nAlternatively, the writer has the right to set boundaries and decide who they give rides to. If they feel that the arrangement is unfair, they can choose to stop. But the question is whether they're in the wrong. If the writer never communicated their expectations before, then it's possible they're not in the wrong because they're asserting their own needs. However, the way they're ending the rides might be seen as a bit extreme given that the friend only contributed once. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the writer communicated their expectations. If they didn't, then expecting the friend to suddenly start contributing could be unfair. But if the writer felt the arrangement was one-sided, ending it isn't wrong. However, the friend's one-time gesture might not justify the reaction. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they're setting a boundary. They have the right to decide who they give rides to and under what conditions. However, there's a nuance here. The friend's action was a small attempt to help, but the writer's response is cutting off rides entirely. That might be a bit harsh, but the writer isn't obligated to continue the rides if they feel it's not fair. So, the answer is B.\n"
