      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for ending free rides. The friend has been getting rides in their car hundreds of times without contributing to gas except once. The author says they ended it by telling the friend to find their way around.\n\nHmm, the key points here are about fairness and reciprocity. The friend used the author's car many times without paying gas except once. The author is asking if it's wrong to stop this. Well, if someone uses your car frequently without contributing to costs, it's reasonable to expect them to help with expenses. The friend's one-time contribution isn't enough given the frequency. So the author's decision to stop might be justified. \n\nBut maybe the author's tone was harsh? They said \"find your way around in the future,\" which could be seen as abrupt. However, the main issue is whether they're in the wrong for ending it. Since the friend hasn't been contributing, the author isn't obligated to keep providing rides. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
