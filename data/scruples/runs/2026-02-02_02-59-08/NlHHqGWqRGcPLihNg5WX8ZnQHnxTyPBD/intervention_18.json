      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who ended their friend's free rides is in the wrong. The situation is that the friend often rides with them, and the author fills up the gas. This time, the friend put in $10 because the author forgot their purse. The author then told the friend to find their own way around in the future.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. The friend has used the car hundreds of times without contributing to gas before. The author is being asked if they're an asshole for ending this arrangement. The key points here are the history of the friend not paying for gas and the recent instance where the friend did contribute. \n\nThe author's reasoning might be that it's unfair to have the friend use their car so often without contributing, especially since the author is covering all the gas costs. The friend's action of putting in $10 might be a one-time thing, but the author feels it's not enough given the long history. So, the author is setting a boundary, expecting the friend to either pay for gas or find another way. \n\nOn the other hand, the friend might see this as a minor infraction, just one instance where they didn't pay, and the author is overreacting. However, considering the repeated use without contribution, it's reasonable for the author to want to stop the free rides. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the author communicated their expectations clearly and the friend didn't meet them, then the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for ending the arrangement. The friend's past behavior might have set an expectation that the author is now correcting. \n\nSo, the answer would likely be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong because they're setting boundaries after repeated unreciprocated use. The one-time contribution doesn't offset the long-term use, so the author's decision is justified.\n"
