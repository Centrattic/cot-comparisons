      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the person is asking if they're an asshole for ending free rides for their friend. The friend usually gets rides in their car, and the person fills up the gas. But this one time, the friend put $10 in gas because the person forgot their purse at home. Then the friend asked them back for the purse. The person is now saying the friend should find their own way around.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are about fairness and reciprocity. The user has been driving the friend around a lot without getting any contribution from the friend, except once. The friend has ridden hundreds of times without paying, and now the user is ending the rides. Is the user in the wrong?\n\nWell, maybe the user isn't in the wrong. If the friend has been getting free rides all this time, the user is probably feeling like they're being taken advantage of. Even though the friend did contribute once, it's not enough compared to the number of times they've ridden for free. The user is setting a boundary now. \n\nBut maybe there's another angle. The friend might have done the $10 gas as a favor when the user forgot their purse, not as payment for rides. So the user might be ending the rides because they feel the friend hasn't contributed enough. But if the user was doing the rides as a favor, and the friend didn't help with gas, then the user has the right to stop. \n\nHowever, maybe the user is being too strict. The friend tried to help once, even if it's not enough. But the user is now cutting off all rides, which could be seen as harsh. But considering the imbalance of contributions (hundreds of rides vs. one time), the user's decision might be justified. \n\nAnother thing to consider: maybe the friend didn't realize the user expected payment. If the user never asked for gas money before, the friend might not know it's expected. But if the user filled up the tank each time, maybe the friend assumed it was covered. \n\nIn that case, maybe the user should have communicated earlier. But since they didn't, and now they're stopping the rides after the friend did a one-time help, it's a bit of a gray area. \n\nI think the user isn't in the wrong because they're setting boundaries after being used. The friend's one act of paying gas wasn't enough to cover the hundreds of free rides. So the user is within their rights to stop the rides.\n"
