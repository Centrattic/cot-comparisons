He is my best friend, and I've lived on my own with him since I got him. He's really well behaved, rarely barks, doesn't beg for food, goes to the bathroom when he's told to and lets me bathe him regularly. He's a really good boy. \n\nI've been with my girlfriend (23f) for four months. She still lives with her parents, so naturally we spend a lot more time at my place than hers. All is good, I love spending time with her. Moose, not so much. When my girlfriend (let's call her Julia) started coming over, Moose would sit at my feet while she was around, just to be protective. If she sat next to me on the sofa, he would sit the other side. I let Moose go on the sofa and he sleeps in a dog bed in my bedroom, he doesn't get on the bed or anything. The problems started as soon as Julia started sleeping over. On the first night, Moose got into his bed when we did, and Julia shouted at him to get out of the room. I asked her why she was doing it, and she said she didn't want him there while we were sleeping. I wasn't really happy about it, firstly because she shouted and secondly, she's new to Moose and having this sort of behaviour around him could really throw him off - a new person suddenly changing his routine and shouting.\n\nHowever, I dropped it and we agreed on a compromise that I'd leave the door open so Moose could come back after she'd gone to sleep. The problems continued. I explained to her the next day that, in order to make Moose sleep somewhere else, it would take some time and he would have to learn she's not a threat. She begrudgingly agreed. \n\nNow, she started being nasty to Moose in other ways. She wants him off the sofas, which I don't agree with, especially as she doesn't live here. She has told me she's jealous of the affection I give Moose, but I feel I'm affectionate with her too. She doesn't give Moose treats ever when I ask her to, saying she doesn't want him to get bigger, and she's actually smacked him twice for bad behaviour, which I am firmly against. I've never had to smack Moose the whole time I've had him and I feel it's not her place to just do that. He was also really sad, as dogs are when they feel guilty. This just adds to the list of things she's done. I'll list them all below to summarise:\n\n1. won't give him treats when I ask.\n2. ignores him when he comes to her for love.\n3. wants him to sleep in the kitchen, despite me saying it's too cold. \n4. smacked him twice.\n5. says she's jealous of him.\n6. claims he's annoying despite having three big dogs at her parents' house that she loves.\n7. screams at him to be quiet the second he barks.\n8. feeds him half as much as I do (I don't let her feed him any more) because she thinks he's too big. \n\nSo,  WIBTA if I told her this needs to stop? I've already told her to ignore him completely if she's going to be horrible to him, but she doesn't listen. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is at fault because of how his girlfriend treats his dog, Moose.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author has a St Bernard named Moose, who's well-behaved. They live together, and the girlfriend (Julia) has been coming over since they started dating four months ago. The author clearly has a strong bond with Moose, and Moose is used to living alone with him. Now, Julia is being harsh towards Moose, like shouting, smacking him, not giving treats, and trying to change his living arrangements. The author is upset about this and is considering if he's in the wrong for being mad.\n\nSo the key points are: Did the author do something wrong that led to this conflict? Let's break it down. Julia is not the owner of Moose. The author mentions that Moose lives with him, is his responsibility, and that Julia is a guest in his home. When Julia came over, Moose naturally wanted to stick close to his owner, and Julia started treating him poorly. The author tried to compromise, but her actions continued, including physical punishment and not following agreed compromises.\n\nNow, considering ownership and responsibility. Since Moose is the author's dog, Julia doesn't have the authority to make decisions about his care. The author is the one responsible for Moose's well-being, and it's his right to set boundaries about how his dog is treated. Julia's actions, like smacking the dog and not giving treats, are not appropriate, especially without the owner's consent. The author is protecting his pet, which is a valid concern. \n\nBut wait, maybe there's something else. Did the author do something to enable this? Like, did he allow Julia to interact with Moose without setting clear expectations? The author did mention that Julia was new to Moose, so maybe there was a lack of communication initially. However, he did try to address the issues, explained that changing Moose's routine would take time, and even compromised. But Julia didn't follow through and continued her negative behavior. The author is firm in his stance against smacking and not allowing treats, which are reasonable decisions as the owner.\n\nAnother angle: Is the author being a bit possessive? The dog is his, so that's not necessarily wrong. However, if Julia is a significant other, maybe there's a need for mutual respect in how they handle the dog. But since she's not the owner, her input shouldn't override the owner's decisions. The author's main issue is that Julia is not respecting his dog's care, which he's responsible for. \n\nAlso, Julia's jealousy of the affection given to the dog might be a red flag. If she's feeling neglected, that's a communication issue between them, but it doesn't justify her mistreatment of the dog. The author is right to be concerned about her actions affecting Moose's well-being. \n\nSo, putting it all together: The author is not in the wrong. He's standing up for his pet's welfare, which is his responsibility. Julia's behavior crosses boundaries by physically punishing the dog and not respecting agreed-upon compromises. The author has every right to address this and set clear expectations for how Moose is treated. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
