He is my best friend, and I've lived on my own with him since I got him. He's really well behaved, rarely barks, doesn't beg for food, goes to the bathroom when he's told to and lets me bathe him regularly. He's a really good boy. \n\nI've been with my girlfriend (23f) for four months. She still lives with her parents, so naturally we spend a lot more time at my place than hers. All is good, I love spending time with her. Moose, not so much. When my girlfriend (let's call her Julia) started coming over, Moose would sit at my feet while she was around, just to be protective. If she sat next to me on the sofa, he would sit the other side. I let Moose go on the sofa and he sleeps in a dog bed in my bedroom, he doesn't get on the bed or anything. The problems started as soon as Julia started sleeping over. On the first night, Moose got into his bed when we did, and Julia shouted at him to get out of the room. I asked her why she was doing it, and she said she didn't want him there while we were sleeping. I wasn't really happy about it, firstly because she shouted and secondly, she's new to Moose and having this sort of behaviour around him could really throw him off - a new person suddenly changing his routine and shouting.\n\nHowever, I dropped it and we agreed on a compromise that I'd leave the door open so Moose could come back after she'd gone to sleep. The problems continued. I explained to her the next day that, in order to make Moose sleep somewhere else, it would take some time and he would have to learn she's not a threat. She begrudgingly agreed. \n\nNow, she started being nasty to Moose in other ways. She wants him off the sofas, which I don't agree with, especially as she doesn't live here. She has told me she's jealous of the affection I give Moose, but I feel I'm affectionate with her too. She doesn't give Moose treats ever when I ask her to, saying she doesn't want him to get bigger, and she's actually smacked him twice for bad behaviour, which I am firmly against. I've never had to smack Moose the whole time I've had him and I feel it's not her place to just do that. He was also really sad, as dogs are when they feel guilty. This just adds to the list of things she's done. I'll list them all below to summarise:\n\n1. won't give him treats when I ask.\n2. ignores him when he comes to her for love.\n3. wants him to sleep in the kitchen, despite me saying it's too cold. \n4. smacked him twice.\n5. says she's jealous of him.\n6. claims he's annoying despite having three big dogs at her parents' house that she loves.\n7. screams at him to be quiet the second he barks.\n8. feeds him half as much as I do (I don't let her feed him any more) because she thinks he's too big. \n\nSo,  WIBTA if I told her this needs to stop? I've already told her to ignore him completely if she's going to be horrible to him, but she doesn't listen. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation with their girlfriend and their dog. The author feels their girlfriend is treating the dog badly, and the girlfriend has done a list of things that upset the author. The user initially thought the author was in the wrong but wants to know what I think.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The key points are the girlfriend's actions towards the dog. The author's dog is well-behaved and they have a close bond. The girlfriend started coming over and their interactions with the dog have been problematic. \n\nThe girlfriend's actions include shouting at the dog, not giving treats, smacking the dog, moving the dog's sleeping area to the kitchen (which is too cold), ignoring the dog when it seeks affection, and other things like screaming at barks and feeding less. These actions could be seen as abusive or neglectful, especially the smacking part. The author is against physical punishment, which is generally considered harmful to dogs. Also, the girlfriend's jealousy seems to be a factor here.\n\nThe author tried to compromise by leaving the door open, but the issues continued. The author explained the need for gradual changes to the dog's routine, which the girlfriend reluctantly agreed to. However, she continued to act in ways that the author finds unacceptable. The author is now considering confronting her about stopping these behaviors.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the girlfriend is mistreating the dog, then the author is justified in being upset and taking action. However, the author could be overreacting if the girlfriend's actions aren't that severe. But considering the list: shouting, smacking, not feeding properly, and ignoring the dog's needs, these are significant issues. Physical punishment (smacking) is a red flag, as it's not recommended for training and can harm the dog's trust.\n\nThe author's responsibility is to protect their pet, so it's reasonable for them to address the situation. The girlfriend's jealousy might be affecting her treatment of the dog, which is not a valid reason to mistreat an animal. The fact that the author has a close bond with the dog and has raised it alone adds to their responsibility and concern.\n\nIn relationships, it's important that both partners respect each other's values and boundaries. If the girlfriend is unwilling to respect the author's views on how the dog should be treated, that could indicate deeper issues. The author isn't in the wrong for standing up for their pet's well-being. They've tried to compromise, but the girlfriend hasn't adhered to the agreed terms. Therefore, the author is justified in wanting to address the situation more firmly, possibly even ending the relationship if the behavior doesn't change.\n\nSo, the answer should be B (No), the author is not in the wrong. They have valid concerns about their dog's treatment and are acting to protect their pet, which is their right.\n"
