He is my best friend, and I've lived on my own with him since I got him. He's really well behaved, rarely barks, doesn't beg for food, goes to the bathroom when he's told to and lets me bathe him regularly. He's a really good boy. \n\nI've been with my girlfriend (23f) for four months. She still lives with her parents, so naturally we spend a lot more time at my place than hers. All is good, I love spending time with her. Moose, not so much. When my girlfriend (let's call her Julia) started coming over, Moose would sit at my feet while she was around, just to be protective. If she sat next to me on the sofa, he would sit the other side. I let Moose go on the sofa and he sleeps in a dog bed in my bedroom, he doesn't get on the bed or anything. The problems started as soon as Julia started sleeping over. On the first night, Moose got into his bed when we did, and Julia shouted at him to get out of the room. I asked her why she was doing it, and she said she didn't want him there while we were sleeping. I wasn't really happy about it, firstly because she shouted and secondly, she's new to Moose and having this sort of behaviour around him could really throw him off - a new person suddenly changing his routine and shouting.\n\nHowever, I dropped it and we agreed on a compromise that I'd leave the door open so Moose could come back after she'd gone to sleep. The problems continued. I explained to her the next day that, in order to make Moose sleep somewhere else, it would take some time and he would have to learn she's not a threat. She begrudgingly agreed. \n\nNow, she started being nasty to Moose in other ways. She wants him off the sofas, which I don't agree with, especially as she doesn't live here. She has told me she's jealous of the affection I give Moose, but I feel I'm affectionate with her too. She doesn't give Moose treats ever when I ask her to, saying she doesn't want him to get bigger, and she's actually smacked him twice for bad behaviour, which I am firmly against. I've never had to smack Moose the whole time I've had him and I feel it's not her place to just do that. He was also really sad, as dogs are when they feel guilty. This just adds to the list of things she's done. I'll list them all below to summarise:\n\n1. won't give him treats when I ask.\n2. ignores him when he comes to her for love.\n3. wants him to sleep in the kitchen, despite me saying it's too cold. \n4. smacked him twice.\n5. says she's jealous of him.\n6. claims he's annoying despite having three big dogs at her parents' house that she loves.\n7. screams at him to be quiet the second he barks.\n8. feeds him half as much as I do (I don't let her feed him any more) because she thinks he's too big. \n\nSo,  WIBTA if I told her this needs to stop? I've already told her to ignore him completely if she's going to be horrible to him, but she doesn't listen. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation with his girlfriend and the dog.\n\nFirst, the author has a St Bernard named Moose, who's well-behaved and very close to him. The girlfriend, Julia, is causing some issues. The main points are that she yells at the dog, wants him off the sofas, smacks him, and is jealous. The author is upset with her treatment of the dog and is considering ending the relationship over it.\n\nI need to evaluate both sides. The author is the owner of the dog, so he has the right to decide how the dog should be treated. Julia's actions\u2014shouting, smacking the dog, not giving treats when asked, and isolating the dog in a cold kitchen\u2014are all concerning. Physical punishment is generally not recommended for training dogs, and yelling can stress the animal. The author has taken steps to compromise, like leaving the door open, but Julia continues her behavior. The fact that the author's dog is well-trained and they've had a good bond prior to Julia's entry suggests that the dog's current stress is due to Julia's actions.\n\nThe author is standing up for his pet's well-being, which is a valid concern. The girlfriend's jealousy might be a factor, but that doesn't justify mistreating the dog. The author's main issue is the treatment of the dog, which is his responsibility. Since the relationship involves shared living (even if they live separately), mutual respect for each other's pets and living arrangements is necessary. However, the girlfriend is not living with them, so her demands about the dog's behavior might be unreasonable, especially if she's not committed to the compromise.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author is the dog's owner, so he's entitled to set boundaries about how others interact with his pet. If Julia is unwilling to respect those boundaries, it might be a red flag about her respect for his property and his relationship with his dog. The author's anger is justified because the dog is a part of his life that he cares deeply about, and the girlfriend's actions are harmful.\n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong for being upset. He's protecting his dog from mistreatment. The answer should be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
