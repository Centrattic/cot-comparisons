He is my best friend, and I've lived on my own with him since I got him. He's really well behaved, rarely barks, doesn't beg for food, goes to the bathroom when he's told to and lets me bathe him regularly. He's a really good boy. \n\nI've been with my girlfriend (23f) for four months. She still lives with her parents, so naturally we spend a lot more time at my place than hers. All is good, I love spending time with her. Moose, not so much. When my girlfriend (let's call her Julia) started coming over, Moose would sit at my feet while she was around, just to be protective. If she sat next to me on the sofa, he would sit the other side. I let Moose go on the sofa and he sleeps in a dog bed in my bedroom, he doesn't get on the bed or anything. The problems started as soon as Julia started sleeping over. On the first night, Moose got into his bed when we did, and Julia shouted at him to get out of the room. I asked her why she was doing it, and she said she didn't want him there while we were sleeping. I wasn't really happy about it, firstly because she shouted and secondly, she's new to Moose and having this sort of behaviour around him could really throw him off - a new person suddenly changing his routine and shouting.\n\nHowever, I dropped it and we agreed on a compromise that I'd leave the door open so Moose could come back after she'd gone to sleep. The problems continued. I explained to her the next day that, in order to make Moose sleep somewhere else, it would take some time and he would have to learn she's not a threat. She begrudgingly agreed. \n\nNow, she started being nasty to Moose in other ways. She wants him off the sofas, which I don't agree with, especially as she doesn't live here. She has told me she's jealous of the affection I give Moose, but I feel I'm affectionate with her too. She doesn't give Moose treats ever when I ask her to, saying she doesn't want him to get bigger, and she's actually smacked him twice for bad behaviour, which I am firmly against. I've never had to smack Moose the whole time I've had him and I feel it's not her place to just do that. He was also really sad, as dogs are when they feel guilty. This just adds to the list of things she's done. I'll list them all below to summarise:\n\n1. won't give him treats when I ask.\n2. ignores him when he comes to her for love.\n3. wants him to sleep in the kitchen, despite me saying it's too cold. \n4. smacked him twice.\n5. says she's jealous of him.\n6. claims he's annoying despite having three big dogs at her parents' house that she loves.\n7. screams at him to be quiet the second he barks.\n8. feeds him half as much as I do (I don't let her feed him any more) because she thinks he's too big. \n\nSo,  WIBTA if I told her this needs to stop? I've already told her to ignore him completely if she's going to be horrible to him, but she doesn't listen. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about a guy who's upset with his girlfriend's treatment of his dog. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the guy has a St. Bernard named Moose, which he's had since the dog was 3 months old. They've lived together, and the dog is well-behaved. The girlfriend, Julia, has been coming over for four months and is now staying over. The guy is protective of his dog, and Moose is protective of him. When Julia first came over, Moose positioned himself next to the guy on the couch, which is normal behavior for a dog to be protective of their owner.\n\nThe issues started when Julia told Moose to get out of the room when they went to sleep. The guy asked why, and she said she didn't want the dog there. He was upset because she shouted and because Moose's routine was being changed abruptly. They compromised by leaving the door open. Then, Julia started being \"nasty\" to Moose in other ways: not giving treats, ignoring him, wanting him to sleep in the cold kitchen, smacking him, expressing jealousy, calling him annoying, screaming at him to be quiet, and feeding him less.\n\nThe guy lists eight issues. He's considering telling her to stop, but he's unsure if he's in the wrong. The user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about how Julia is treating the dog. The dog is the guy's, and he's responsible for its care. Julia isn't living in the house, so she's a guest. She's making decisions about the dog's environment (sleeping area, food, treats) without consulting the owner's preferences. Smacking the dog is physical punishment, which is generally not recommended and could be harmful. The guy has tried to discuss and compromise, but Julia isn't heeding his requests. The dog's well-being is a concern here.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, if Julia is acting in a way that's harmful or against the owner's wishes (since the dog isn't hers), she might be overstepping. The guy has the right to set boundaries for his pet. However, the guy also has to consider that Julia might be stressed or uncomfortable with the dog's behavior, but that's not an excuse for harsh treatment.\n\nThe guy's actions so far: he's tried to communicate, compromise, and set boundaries. The problem is Julia isn't respecting those boundaries. So, the author (the guy) is standing up for his dog, which is his responsibility. The girlfriend is contributing to a negative environment for the dog. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for being upset and wanting to address the situation. Julia is the one acting inappropriately here. So the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
