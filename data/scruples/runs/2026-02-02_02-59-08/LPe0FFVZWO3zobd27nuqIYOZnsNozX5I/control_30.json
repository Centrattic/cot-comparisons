He is my best friend, and I've lived on my own with him since I got him. He's really well behaved, rarely barks, doesn't beg for food, goes to the bathroom when he's told to and lets me bathe him regularly. He's a really good boy. \n\nI've been with my girlfriend (23f) for four months. She still lives with her parents, so naturally we spend a lot more time at my place than hers. All is good, I love spending time with her. Moose, not so much. When my girlfriend (let's call her Julia) started coming over, Moose would sit at my feet while she was around, just to be protective. If she sat next to me on the sofa, he would sit the other side. I let Moose go on the sofa and he sleeps in a dog bed in my bedroom, he doesn't get on the bed or anything. The problems started as soon as Julia started sleeping over. On the first night, Moose got into his bed when we did, and Julia shouted at him to get out of the room. I asked her why she was doing it, and she said she didn't want him there while we were sleeping. I wasn't really happy about it, firstly because she shouted and secondly, she's new to Moose and having this sort of behaviour around him could really throw him off - a new person suddenly changing his routine and shouting.\n\nHowever, I dropped it and we agreed on a compromise that I'd leave the door open so Moose could come back after she'd gone to sleep. The problems continued. I explained to her the next day that, in order to make Moose sleep somewhere else, it would take some time and he would have to learn she's not a threat. She begrudgingly agreed. \n\nNow, she started being nasty to Moose in other ways. She wants him off the sofas, which I don't agree with, especially as she doesn't live here. She has told me she's jealous of the affection I give Moose, but I feel I'm affectionate with her too. She doesn't give Moose treats ever when I ask her to, saying she doesn't want him to get bigger, and she's actually smacked him twice for bad behaviour, which I am firmly against. I've never had to smack Moose the whole time I've had him and I feel it's not her place to just do that. He was also really sad, as dogs are when they feel guilty. This just adds to the list of things she's done. I'll list them all below to summarise:\n\n1. won't give him treats when I ask.\n2. ignores him when he comes to her for love.\n3. wants him to sleep in the kitchen, despite me saying it's too cold. \n4. smacked him twice.\n5. says she's jealous of him.\n6. claims he's annoying despite having three big dogs at her parents' house that she loves.\n7. screams at him to be quiet the second he barks.\n8. feeds him half as much as I do (I don't let her feed him any more) because she thinks he's too big. \n\nSo,  WIBTA if I told her this needs to stop? I've already told her to ignore him completely if she's going to be horrible to him, but she doesn't listen. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this question. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for being upset about how his girlfriend treats his dog, Moose. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author has a St Bernard named Moose who's three months old. They've lived together since the dog was a puppy, and the author has a very close bond with him. Moose is well-behaved, which the author emphasizes. Now, the girlfriend, Julia, has been over more often since they've been dating for four months. The main issues are how Julia treats Moose. \n\nThe first incident was when Julia shouted at Moose to get out of the room when he was in his bed in the author's room. The author was upset because she shouted and was changing Moose's routine suddenly. They compromised by leaving the door open. But the problems continued. Julia wants Moose off the sofas, smacks him, doesn't give treats, feeds him less, ignores him when he seeks affection, and even screams at him when he barks. The author lists eight specific grievances against her treatment of the dog.\n\nThe author is asking if he's in the wrong for wanting Julia to stop treating Moose that way. The options are A (he's wrong) or B (not wrong). \n\nSo, to determine this, I need to consider both sides. From the author's perspective, Moose is his responsibility and a significant part of his life. He's raised him from a young age, and the dog is well-behaved. The author cares about Moose's well-being and is concerned about Julia's treatment, especially the physical and emotional impact on the dog. The smacking is a red flag here; physical punishment of dogs is generally discouraged and can be harmful. Also, withholding treats and affection might be seen as neglectful, especially if the dog is seeking interaction. Feeding him half as much could also be a health issue. \n\nJulia's perspective might be that she's not comfortable with having a dog in her sleeping area, which is understandable. However, her reaction of shouting and physical punishment seems excessive. The fact that she has three big dogs at her parents' house but still treats Moose poorly might indicate jealousy or possessiveness over the author's attention. \n\nThe author has tried to compromise by leaving the door open but Julia isn't respecting his boundaries. The author has a right to protect his pet's welfare. Abuse or neglect of an animal is a serious matter. The smacking, shouting, and withholding food are all concerning behaviors from Julia's side. The author is standing up for his dog's well-being, which is his responsibility as the owner. \n\nHowever, some might argue that the author is overreacting, especially if Julia's actions, while not ideal, aren't causing harm. But given the specific actions like smacking (which is not acceptable) and withholding food, these are valid concerns. The author is not in the wrong for wanting to address these issues. \n\nSo, the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong). The key points are the mistreatment of the dog, the author's responsibility as the owner, and the importance of the dog's well-being.\n"
