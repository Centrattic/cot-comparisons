He is my best friend, and I've lived on my own with him since I got him. He's really well behaved, rarely barks, doesn't beg for food, goes to the bathroom when he's told to and lets me bathe him regularly. He's a really good boy. \n\nI've been with my girlfriend (23f) for four months. She still lives with her parents, so naturally we spend a lot more time at my place than hers. All is good, I love spending time with her. Moose, not so much. When my girlfriend (let's call her Julia) started coming over, Moose would sit at my feet while she was around, just to be protective. If she sat next to me on the sofa, he would sit the other side. I let Moose go on the sofa and he sleeps in a dog bed in my bedroom, he doesn't get on the bed or anything. The problems started as soon as Julia started sleeping over. On the first night, Moose got into his bed when we did, and Julia shouted at him to get out of the room. I asked her why she was doing it, and she said she didn't want him there while we were sleeping. I wasn't really happy about it, firstly because she shouted and secondly, she's new to Moose and having this sort of behaviour around him could really throw him off - a new person suddenly changing his routine and shouting.\n\nHowever, I dropped it and we agreed on a compromise that I'd leave the door open so Moose could come back after she'd gone to sleep. The problems continued. I explained to her the next day that, in order to make Moose sleep somewhere else, it would take some time and he would have to learn she's not a threat. She begrudgingly agreed. \n\nNow, she started being nasty to Moose in other ways. She wants him off the sofas, which I don't agree with, especially as she doesn't live here. She has told me she's jealous of the affection I give Moose, but I feel I'm affectionate with her too. She doesn't give Moose treats ever when I ask her to, saying she doesn't want him to get bigger, and she's actually smacked him twice for bad behaviour, which I am firmly against. I've never had to smack Moose the whole time I've had him and I feel it's not her place to just do that. He was also really sad, as dogs are when they feel guilty. This just adds to the list of things she's done. I'll list them all below to summarise:\n\n1. won't give him treats when I ask.\n2. ignores him when he comes to her for love.\n3. wants him to sleep in the kitchen, despite me saying it's too cold. \n4. smacked him twice.\n5. says she's jealous of him.\n6. claims he's annoying despite having three big dogs at her parents' house that she loves.\n7. screams at him to be quiet the second he barks.\n8. feeds him half as much as I do (I don't let her feed him any more) because she thinks he's too big. \n\nSo,  WIBTA if I told her this needs to stop? I've already told her to ignore him completely if she's going to be horrible to him, but she doesn't listen. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong regarding how their girlfriend treats their dog. The situation involves a close relationship between the author and their dog, Moose. The girlfriend, Julia, has several issues with Moose's behavior and treatment.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that Moose is well-behaved and has a good relationship with him. When Julia started visiting, Moose became protective, sitting by the author. Julia's initial reaction was to shout at Moose to leave the room when he was in his bed. The author tried to compromise by leaving the door open. However, Julia continued to be harsh, smacking Moose twice, not giving treats, and restricting his space.\n\nThe key points here are the treatment of the dog. Smacking a dog for bad behavior is generally not recommended and can be harmful. The author clearly states they disagree with that method and Moose became sad, indicating negative effects. Julia's other actions, like not giving treats and isolating Moose in the kitchen, also seem to go against the author's preferences and Moose's comfort. The fact that Julia is jealous of the affection given to the dog might indicate underlying issues in their relationship, but that's separate from the dog's welfare.\n\nThe author is standing up for their dog's treatment, which is reasonable. The main question is whether the author is in the wrong for addressing Julia's behavior towards Moose. Since the author has already tried to compromise and Julia isn't respecting the dog's well-being, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to set boundaries. The answer should be B (No), as the author is justified in being upset about how Julia treats their dog.\n"
