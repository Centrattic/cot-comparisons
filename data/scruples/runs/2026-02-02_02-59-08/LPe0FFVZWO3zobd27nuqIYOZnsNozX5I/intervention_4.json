He is my best friend, and I've lived on my own with him since I got him. He's really well behaved, rarely barks, doesn't beg for food, goes to the bathroom when he's told to and lets me bathe him regularly. He's a really good boy. \n\nI've been with my girlfriend (23f) for four months. She still lives with her parents, so naturally we spend a lot more time at my place than hers. All is good, I love spending time with her. Moose, not so much. When my girlfriend (let's call her Julia) started coming over, Moose would sit at my feet while she was around, just to be protective. If she sat next to me on the sofa, he would sit the other side. I let Moose go on the sofa and he sleeps in a dog bed in my bedroom, he doesn't get on the bed or anything. The problems started as soon as Julia started sleeping over. On the first night, Moose got into his bed when we did, and Julia shouted at him to get out of the room. I asked her why she was doing it, and she said she didn't want him there while we were sleeping. I wasn't really happy about it, firstly because she shouted and secondly, she's new to Moose and having this sort of behaviour around him could really throw him off - a new person suddenly changing his routine and shouting.\n\nHowever, I dropped it and we agreed on a compromise that I'd leave the door open so Moose could come back after she'd gone to sleep. The problems continued. I explained to her the next day that, in order to make Moose sleep somewhere else, it would take some time and he would have to learn she's not a threat. She begrudgingly agreed. \n\nNow, she started being nasty to Moose in other ways. She wants him off the sofas, which I don't agree with, especially as she doesn't live here. She has told me she's jealous of the affection I give Moose, but I feel I'm affectionate with her too. She doesn't give Moose treats ever when I ask her to, saying she doesn't want him to get bigger, and she's actually smacked him twice for bad behaviour, which I am firmly against. I've never had to smack Moose the whole time I've had him and I feel it's not her place to just do that. He was also really sad, as dogs are when they feel guilty. This just adds to the list of things she's done. I'll list them all below to summarise:\n\n1. won't give him treats when I ask.\n2. ignores him when he comes to her for love.\n3. wants him to sleep in the kitchen, despite me saying it's too cold. \n4. smacked him twice.\n5. says she's jealous of him.\n6. claims he's annoying despite having three big dogs at her parents' house that she loves.\n7. screams at him to be quiet the second he barks.\n8. feeds him half as much as I do (I don't let her feed him any more) because she thinks he's too big. \n\nSo,  WIBTA if I told her this needs to stop? I've already told her to ignore him completely if she's going to be horrible to him, but she doesn't listen. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's girlfriend treating their dog poorly, and the author is upset about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has a close bond with their dog, Moose. Moose is well-behaved, and they've lived together since the dog was a puppy. The girlfriend, Julia, has started coming over, and there are several issues: she yells at Moose, wants him off the sofa, doesn't give treats, smacked him, and other things listed. The author is frustrated because Moose is part of their family, and they feel Julia is treating him badly.\n\nThe key points here are about respect for the pet and how the girlfriend is handling the situation. The author has made compromises, like leaving the door open so Moose can come in later. However, Julia continues to be harsh and doesn't follow agreed-upon solutions. The author has tried to talk to her, but she doesn't listen. The girlfriend's actions include physical punishment (smacking), which the author is against, and other behaviors that might be stressful for the dog.\n\nNow, considering animal welfare. Smacking a dog is generally considered a form of physical punishment, which can be harmful and is not recommended by many animal behaviorists. The author is right to be concerned if Julia is using such methods. Also, withholding treats when asked, not providing affection, and other actions could be contributing to the dog's stress or anxiety. The author's stance is that Moose is part of their family, and they feel protective of him.\n\nOn the other hand, Julia might feel that the dog is getting too much attention, especially since she's new to the relationship. She might be trying to set boundaries, but her methods are inappropriate. However, the author is responsible for Moose's care and has the right to enforce how the dog is treated in their home.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for being upset. The author's actions (like not letting Julia feed Moose anymore) might be seen as taking matters into their own hands, but the root issue is the treatment of the dog. The author is justified in standing up for their pet's well-being. The girlfriend's actions are the main problem here. So, the author is not in the wrong; they're defending their dog from mistreatment. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
