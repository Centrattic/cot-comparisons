He is my best friend, and I've lived on my own with him since I got him. He's really well behaved, rarely barks, doesn't beg for food, goes to the bathroom when he's told to and lets me bathe him regularly. He's a really good boy. \n\nI've been with my girlfriend (23f) for four months. She still lives with her parents, so naturally we spend a lot more time at my place than hers. All is good, I love spending time with her. Moose, not so much. When my girlfriend (let's call her Julia) started coming over, Moose would sit at my feet while she was around, just to be protective. If she sat next to me on the sofa, he would sit the other side. I let Moose go on the sofa and he sleeps in a dog bed in my bedroom, he doesn't get on the bed or anything. The problems started as soon as Julia started sleeping over. On the first night, Moose got into his bed when we did, and Julia shouted at him to get out of the room. I asked her why she was doing it, and she said she didn't want him there while we were sleeping. I wasn't really happy about it, firstly because she shouted and secondly, she's new to Moose and having this sort of behaviour around him could really throw him off - a new person suddenly changing his routine and shouting.\n\nHowever, I dropped it and we agreed on a compromise that I'd leave the door open so Moose could come back after she'd gone to sleep. The problems continued. I explained to her the next day that, in order to make Moose sleep somewhere else, it would take some time and he would have to learn she's not a threat. She begrudgingly agreed. \n\nNow, she started being nasty to Moose in other ways. She wants him off the sofas, which I don't agree with, especially as she doesn't live here. She has told me she's jealous of the affection I give Moose, but I feel I'm affectionate with her too. She doesn't give Moose treats ever when I ask her to, saying she doesn't want him to get bigger, and she's actually smacked him twice for bad behaviour, which I am firmly against. I've never had to smack Moose the whole time I've had him and I feel it's not her place to just do that. He was also really sad, as dogs are when they feel guilty. This just adds to the list of things she's done. I'll list them all below to summarise:\n\n1. won't give him treats when I ask.\n2. ignores him when he comes to her for love.\n3. wants him to sleep in the kitchen, despite me saying it's too cold. \n4. smacked him twice.\n5. says she's jealous of him.\n6. claims he's annoying despite having three big dogs at her parents' house that she loves.\n7. screams at him to be quiet the second he barks.\n8. feeds him half as much as I do (I don't let her feed him any more) because she thinks he's too big. \n\nSo,  WIBTA if I told her this needs to stop? I've already told her to ignore him completely if she's going to be horrible to him, but she doesn't listen. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The author is a guy who's upset about how his girlfriend treats his dog, Moose. He lists several issues: the girlfriend won't give treats when asked, ignores the dog, wants him to sleep in the kitchen (which is cold), has smacked the dog twice, is jealous of him, calls him annoying despite having three big dogs at home, yells at him for barking, and feeds him less.\n\nFirst, the author's main concern is the treatment of his dog. The girlfriend is new to the situation, so maybe she's not used to having a dog in the house. But some of her actions seem problematic. Smacking the dog is definitely not advisable, as the author mentions he's against it. Also, yelling at the dog might be stressful for the animal. The girlfriend's jealousy could be a red flag if it's affecting her behavior towards the pet.\n\nOn the other hand, the author brought the dog into the relationship. He's had the dog for a while and now has a girlfriend. The girlfriend might feel that her presence isn't being prioritized, hence her jealousy. However, the way she's expressing that jealousy (by being mean to the dog) isn't healthy. The author should have clear boundaries about how his pet is treated. \n\nThe compromise about the dog sleeping in the room with the door open seems like a mutual agreement. But the girlfriend is breaking that agreement by not respecting the compromise. Also, the author mentions that the dog is well-behaved, so the girlfriend's complaints about the dog's behavior might be unfounded. \n\nThe author is trying to protect his dog, which is a valid concern. The girlfriend's actions are causing the dog distress, which is a problem. The author has a right to be upset if his partner is mistreating his pet, especially since the dog is his responsibility and a big part of his life. \n\nBut maybe the author should have set clearer expectations from the start. If the girlfriend was aware that the dog is a big part of his life and how he treats him, she might not have acted that way. However, the girlfriend should respect the dog's presence and the author's feelings about it. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author is doing the right thing by not letting her feed the dog anymore because she's reducing his food without consulting. That shows he's trying to protect the dog's health. The girlfriend's actions are crossing lines that the author has set, so he's justified in being upset. \n\nThe conclusion here would be that the author is not in the wrong. The girlfriend's behavior towards the dog is problematic, and the author has every right to address it. The boyfriend is protecting his pet from mistreatment, which is a valid concern. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
