He is my best friend, and I've lived on my own with him since I got him. He's really well behaved, rarely barks, doesn't beg for food, goes to the bathroom when he's told to and lets me bathe him regularly. He's a really good boy. \n\nI've been with my girlfriend (23f) for four months. She still lives with her parents, so naturally we spend a lot more time at my place than hers. All is good, I love spending time with her. Moose, not so much. When my girlfriend (let's call her Julia) started coming over, Moose would sit at my feet while she was around, just to be protective. If she sat next to me on the sofa, he would sit the other side. I let Moose go on the sofa and he sleeps in a dog bed in my bedroom, he doesn't get on the bed or anything. The problems started as soon as Julia started sleeping over. On the first night, Moose got into his bed when we did, and Julia shouted at him to get out of the room. I asked her why she was doing it, and she said she didn't want him there while we were sleeping. I wasn't really happy about it, firstly because she shouted and secondly, she's new to Moose and having this sort of behaviour around him could really throw him off - a new person suddenly changing his routine and shouting.\n\nHowever, I dropped it and we agreed on a compromise that I'd leave the door open so Moose could come back after she'd gone to sleep. The problems continued. I explained to her the next day that, in order to make Moose sleep somewhere else, it would take some time and he would have to learn she's not a threat. She begrudgingly agreed. \n\nNow, she started being nasty to Moose in other ways. She wants him off the sofas, which I don't agree with, especially as she doesn't live here. She has told me she's jealous of the affection I give Moose, but I feel I'm affectionate with her too. She doesn't give Moose treats ever when I ask her to, saying she doesn't want him to get bigger, and she's actually smacked him twice for bad behaviour, which I am firmly against. I've never had to smack Moose the whole time I've had him and I feel it's not her place to just do that. He was also really sad, as dogs are when they feel guilty. This just adds to the list of things she's done. I'll list them all below to summarise:\n\n1. won't give him treats when I ask.\n2. ignores him when he comes to her for love.\n3. wants him to sleep in the kitchen, despite me saying it's too cold. \n4. smacked him twice.\n5. says she's jealous of him.\n6. claims he's annoying despite having three big dogs at her parents' house that she loves.\n7. screams at him to be quiet the second he barks.\n8. feeds him half as much as I do (I don't let her feed him any more) because she thinks he's too big. \n\nSo,  WIBTA if I told her this needs to stop? I've already told her to ignore him completely if she's going to be horrible to him, but she doesn't listen. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being upset with how his girlfriend treats his dog. The situation involves a lot of specific points the girlfriend has done that the author dislikes.\n\nFirst, the author's dog, Moose, is described as well-behaved and part of his life for three months. The girlfriend started coming over four months ago, and conflicts arose. The key issues are the girlfriend's treatment of the dog: yelling, smacking, not giving treats, wanting him to sleep in the kitchen, etc. The author feels protective of his dog and is upset with her actions.\n\nI need to consider both sides. The girlfriend is new to the situation, living with her parents, and perhaps has different views on pet care. However, the author is the dog's owner, so he's responsible for the dog's well-being. The girlfriend's actions\u2014like smacking the dog, yelling, and not following the owner's requests\u2014could be seen as crossing boundaries. The author has tried to compromise but feels she's not respecting his rules. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, he's defending his dog's treatment, which is his responsibility. The girlfriend's actions might be reasonable to her, but since she's a guest or cohabiting, she should respect the owner's rules. The author has communicated his boundaries, but she's not adhering to them. That suggests that the author is justified in his anger because his dog's welfare is being compromised. The girlfriend's jealousy might also be a factor, but that doesn't excuse her actions towards the dog.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author could have set clearer boundaries from the start or considered the girlfriend's feelings. However, the situation shows a pattern of the girlfriend not respecting the agreed-upon compromises. The author's main concern is the dog's well-being, which is a valid priority. Therefore, the answer leans towards the author not being in the wrong.\n"
