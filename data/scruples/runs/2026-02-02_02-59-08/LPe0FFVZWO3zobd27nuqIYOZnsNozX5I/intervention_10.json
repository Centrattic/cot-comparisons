He is my best friend, and I've lived on my own with him since I got him. He's really well behaved, rarely barks, doesn't beg for food, goes to the bathroom when he's told to and lets me bathe him regularly. He's a really good boy. \n\nI've been with my girlfriend (23f) for four months. She still lives with her parents, so naturally we spend a lot more time at my place than hers. All is good, I love spending time with her. Moose, not so much. When my girlfriend (let's call her Julia) started coming over, Moose would sit at my feet while she was around, just to be protective. If she sat next to me on the sofa, he would sit the other side. I let Moose go on the sofa and he sleeps in a dog bed in my bedroom, he doesn't get on the bed or anything. The problems started as soon as Julia started sleeping over. On the first night, Moose got into his bed when we did, and Julia shouted at him to get out of the room. I asked her why she was doing it, and she said she didn't want him there while we were sleeping. I wasn't really happy about it, firstly because she shouted and secondly, she's new to Moose and having this sort of behaviour around him could really throw him off - a new person suddenly changing his routine and shouting.\n\nHowever, I dropped it and we agreed on a compromise that I'd leave the door open so Moose could come back after she'd gone to sleep. The problems continued. I explained to her the next day that, in order to make Moose sleep somewhere else, it would take some time and he would have to learn she's not a threat. She begrudgingly agreed. \n\nNow, she started being nasty to Moose in other ways. She wants him off the sofas, which I don't agree with, especially as she doesn't live here. She has told me she's jealous of the affection I give Moose, but I feel I'm affectionate with her too. She doesn't give Moose treats ever when I ask her to, saying she doesn't want him to get bigger, and she's actually smacked him twice for bad behaviour, which I am firmly against. I've never had to smack Moose the whole time I've had him and I feel it's not her place to just do that. He was also really sad, as dogs are when they feel guilty. This just adds to the list of things she's done. I'll list them all below to summarise:\n\n1. won't give him treats when I ask.\n2. ignores him when he comes to her for love.\n3. wants him to sleep in the kitchen, despite me saying it's too cold. \n4. smacked him twice.\n5. says she's jealous of him.\n6. claims he's annoying despite having three big dogs at her parents' house that she loves.\n7. screams at him to be quiet the second he barks.\n8. feeds him half as much as I do (I don't let her feed him any more) because she thinks he's too big. \n\nSo,  WIBTA if I told her this needs to stop? I've already told her to ignore him completely if she's going to be horrible to him, but she doesn't listen. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The author is a guy named A, and his girlfriend Julia is treating his dog, Moose, poorly. The author is upset about this and wants to know if he's in the wrong for being mad.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author has a close bond with his dog. Moose is well-behaved and they've lived together for three months. The girlfriend, Julia, started visiting more, and Moose became protective by sitting near the author when she's around. That's normal dog behavior, right? Then, Julia started sleeping over and immediately told Moose to get out of the room, which the author found upsetting because of the shouting and sudden change in routine. They compromised by leaving the door open. But then Julia continued to have issues with Moose, not giving treats, smacking him, keeping him in the cold kitchen, etc.\n\nThe author lists several problems: refusing treats, ignoring the dog, wanting him in the kitchen, smacking him, jealousy, calling him annoying, screaming at barking, and feeding less. The author is considering telling her to stop but is unsure if he's in the wrong.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. From my perspective, the key points are the treatment of the dog. The author is the owner and responsible for Moose's well-being. Julia's actions seem to be harmful: physical punishment (smacking) is a red flag. It's not up to a non-owner to discipline the dog, especially with methods the owner disagrees with. Also, the physical punishment can be traumatic for the dog and may lead to behavioral issues. \n\nJealousy is mentioned, which might explain some of her behavior, but that doesn't justify mistreatment. The author should have boundaries regarding how his pet is treated. The fact that Julia is imposing her preferences on Moose's treatment (like not allowing on the sofa, feeding less) without considering the owner's input is problematic. The author's compromise (leaving the door open) was reasonable, but Julia isn't respecting his rules when it comes to the dog's care. \n\nIn relationships, it's important to respect each other's boundaries and values. If Julia can't respect the author's views on how his dog should be treated, that's a conflict. The author isn't wrong to be upset about the dog's mistreatment. The answer would likely be B (the author is not in the wrong) because the author is defending his dog from harm and setting boundaries, which is his right as the owner. Julia's actions are the issue here.\n"
