He is my best friend, and I've lived on my own with him since I got him. He's really well behaved, rarely barks, doesn't beg for food, goes to the bathroom when he's told to and lets me bathe him regularly. He's a really good boy. \n\nI've been with my girlfriend (23f) for four months. She still lives with her parents, so naturally we spend a lot more time at my place than hers. All is good, I love spending time with her. Moose, not so much. When my girlfriend (let's call her Julia) started coming over, Moose would sit at my feet while she was around, just to be protective. If she sat next to me on the sofa, he would sit the other side. I let Moose go on the sofa and he sleeps in a dog bed in my bedroom, he doesn't get on the bed or anything. The problems started as soon as Julia started sleeping over. On the first night, Moose got into his bed when we did, and Julia shouted at him to get out of the room. I asked her why she was doing it, and she said she didn't want him there while we were sleeping. I wasn't really happy about it, firstly because she shouted and secondly, she's new to Moose and having this sort of behaviour around him could really throw him off - a new person suddenly changing his routine and shouting.\n\nHowever, I dropped it and we agreed on a compromise that I'd leave the door open so Moose could come back after she'd gone to sleep. The problems continued. I explained to her the next day that, in order to make Moose sleep somewhere else, it would take some time and he would have to learn she's not a threat. She begrudgingly agreed. \n\nNow, she started being nasty to Moose in other ways. She wants him off the sofas, which I don't agree with, especially as she doesn't live here. She has told me she's jealous of the affection I give Moose, but I feel I'm affectionate with her too. She doesn't give Moose treats ever when I ask her to, saying she doesn't want him to get bigger, and she's actually smacked him twice for bad behaviour, which I am firmly against. I've never had to smack Moose the whole time I've had him and I feel it's not her place to just do that. He was also really sad, as dogs are when they feel guilty. This just adds to the list of things she's done. I'll list them all below to summarise:\n\n1. won't give him treats when I ask.\n2. ignores him when he comes to her for love.\n3. wants him to sleep in the kitchen, despite me saying it's too cold. \n4. smacked him twice.\n5. says she's jealous of him.\n6. claims he's annoying despite having three big dogs at her parents' house that she loves.\n7. screams at him to be quiet the second he barks.\n8. feeds him half as much as I do (I don't let her feed him any more) because she thinks he's too big. \n\nSo,  WIBTA if I told her this needs to stop? I've already told her to ignore him completely if she's going to be horrible to him, but she doesn't listen. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation with his girlfriend and his dog. The author is upset because his girlfriend treats his dog poorly in several ways. The main points are that she shouts at the dog, doesn't give treats, smacks him, wants him in the kitchen, etc. The author is considering whether to confront her about this.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The dog is the author's responsibility, and he's the one who owns it. The girlfriend is visiting his place, so she's a guest. However, since they're in a relationship, expectations about behavior might differ. The author feels that his girlfriend is overstepping by physically punishing the dog and being unkind. The girlfriend, on the other hand, might feel that the dog is getting too much attention or is being disruptive.\n\nFrom an animal welfare perspective, smacking the dog is a red flag. The author mentions that the dog is well-behaved and that physical punishment isn't necessary. The girlfriend's actions could be harmful and stressful for the dog. The author is right to be concerned about the methods she's using, especially since the dog is not hers and she's a guest in his home.\n\nThe girlfriend's jealousy is another factor. She might feel that the dog is getting more attention than her, which is a relationship issue. However, that doesn't justify mistreating the dog. The author's role as the owner is to protect the dog from any mistreatment, even from a partner.\n\nThe key points here are the authority over the dog and the appropriateness of the actions. Since the author is the owner, he has the right to set boundaries on how his dog is treated in his home. The girlfriend's actions cross into abusive behavior, which the author is justified in addressing. The author is not in the wrong for being upset and considering ending the relationship if this continues.\n\nPossible counterarguments might be that the girlfriend's actions are a personal opinion, but physical punishment and shouting are not acceptable. Also, the author's compromise (leaving the door open) was not respected, leading to ongoing issues. The girlfriend's behavior is consistent and harmful, so the author's decision to confront her is reasonable.\n\nIn conclusion, the author is not in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
