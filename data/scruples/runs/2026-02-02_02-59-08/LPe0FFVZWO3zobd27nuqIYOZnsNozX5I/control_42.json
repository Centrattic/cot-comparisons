He is my best friend, and I've lived on my own with him since I got him. He's really well behaved, rarely barks, doesn't beg for food, goes to the bathroom when he's told to and lets me bathe him regularly. He's a really good boy. \n\nI've been with my girlfriend (23f) for four months. She still lives with her parents, so naturally we spend a lot more time at my place than hers. All is good, I love spending time with her. Moose, not so much. When my girlfriend (let's call her Julia) started coming over, Moose would sit at my feet while she was around, just to be protective. If she sat next to me on the sofa, he would sit the other side. I let Moose go on the sofa and he sleeps in a dog bed in my bedroom, he doesn't get on the bed or anything. The problems started as soon as Julia started sleeping over. On the first night, Moose got into his bed when we did, and Julia shouted at him to get out of the room. I asked her why she was doing it, and she said she didn't want him there while we were sleeping. I wasn't really happy about it, firstly because she shouted and secondly, she's new to Moose and having this sort of behaviour around him could really throw him off - a new person suddenly changing his routine and shouting.\n\nHowever, I dropped it and we agreed on a compromise that I'd leave the door open so Moose could come back after she'd gone to sleep. The problems continued. I explained to her the next day that, in order to make Moose sleep somewhere else, it would take some time and he would have to learn she's not a threat. She begrudgingly agreed. \n\nNow, she started being nasty to Moose in other ways. She wants him off the sofas, which I don't agree with, especially as she doesn't live here. She has told me she's jealous of the affection I give Moose, but I feel I'm affectionate with her too. She doesn't give Moose treats ever when I ask her to, saying she doesn't want him to get bigger, and she's actually smacked him twice for bad behaviour, which I am firmly against. I've never had to smack Moose the whole time I've had him and I feel it's not her place to just do that. He was also really sad, as dogs are when they feel guilty. This just adds to the list of things she's done. I'll list them all below to summarise:\n\n1. won't give him treats when I ask.\n2. ignores him when he comes to her for love.\n3. wants him to sleep in the kitchen, despite me saying it's too cold. \n4. smacked him twice.\n5. says she's jealous of him.\n6. claims he's annoying despite having three big dogs at her parents' house that she loves.\n7. screams at him to be quiet the second he barks.\n8. feeds him half as much as I do (I don't let her feed him any more) because she thinks he's too big. \n\nSo,  WIBTA if I told her this needs to stop? I've already told her to ignore him completely if she's going to be horrible to him, but she doesn't listen. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being upset about how his girlfriend treats his dog. The author has a close bond with his St. Bernard, Moose. The girlfriend, Julia, started coming over, and there are several issues listed: shouting at the dog, smacking him, not giving treats, wanting him out of the room, etc. The author is frustrated and wonders if he's in the wrong for being mad about it.\n\nFirst, the key points here are the treatment of the dog. The author mentions that Julia has hit the dog twice, which is a red flag. Physical punishment is generally not recommended and can be harmful. The author is against it, which is understandable. Then there's the issue of shouting and screaming at the dog, which can cause stress and anxiety. The dog's behavior is being affected, like sitting protectively and being sad, indicating emotional impact.\n\nJulia also refuses to give treats when asked, which might be about the dog's size, but the author might have a different opinion on diet. She wants the dog to sleep in the kitchen because it's too cold, which seems unreasonable. The author has made compromises, like leaving the door open, but Julia isn't respecting the dog's established habits and the environment (temperature in the kitchen vs. bedroom).\n\nThe author has communicated his concerns but Julia isn't listening. The question is whether he's in the wrong. From an animal welfare perspective, physical punishment is a problem. The author is advocating for his dog's well-being, which is valid. If Julia is causing harm or stress to the dog, the author has a right to be upset. Relationships require mutual respect, including respect for each other's pets. If Julia can't respect the dog's care and the author's feelings about it, that's a conflict in the relationship.\n\nThe author might be right to address this, especially if it's affecting the dog's well-being. However, it's also important to consider if the author is overreacting. But given the physical punishment and the other issues, it seems like Julia is crossing lines. The author isn't in the wrong for standing up for his dog. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
