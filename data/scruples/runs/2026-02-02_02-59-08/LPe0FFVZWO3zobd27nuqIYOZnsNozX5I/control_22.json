He is my best friend, and I've lived on my own with him since I got him. He's really well behaved, rarely barks, doesn't beg for food, goes to the bathroom when he's told to and lets me bathe him regularly. He's a really good boy. \n\nI've been with my girlfriend (23f) for four months. She still lives with her parents, so naturally we spend a lot more time at my place than hers. All is good, I love spending time with her. Moose, not so much. When my girlfriend (let's call her Julia) started coming over, Moose would sit at my feet while she was around, just to be protective. If she sat next to me on the sofa, he would sit the other side. I let Moose go on the sofa and he sleeps in a dog bed in my bedroom, he doesn't get on the bed or anything. The problems started as soon as Julia started sleeping over. On the first night, Moose got into his bed when we did, and Julia shouted at him to get out of the room. I asked her why she was doing it, and she said she didn't want him there while we were sleeping. I wasn't really happy about it, firstly because she shouted and secondly, she's new to Moose and having this sort of behaviour around him could really throw him off - a new person suddenly changing his routine and shouting.\n\nHowever, I dropped it and we agreed on a compromise that I'd leave the door open so Moose could come back after she'd gone to sleep. The problems continued. I explained to her the next day that, in order to make Moose sleep somewhere else, it would take some time and he would have to learn she's not a threat. She begrudgingly agreed. \n\nNow, she started being nasty to Moose in other ways. She wants him off the sofas, which I don't agree with, especially as she doesn't live here. She has told me she's jealous of the affection I give Moose, but I feel I'm affectionate with her too. She doesn't give Moose treats ever when I ask her to, saying she doesn't want him to get bigger, and she's actually smacked him twice for bad behaviour, which I am firmly against. I've never had to smack Moose the whole time I've had him and I feel it's not her place to just do that. He was also really sad, as dogs are when they feel guilty. This just adds to the list of things she's done. I'll list them all below to summarise:\n\n1. won't give him treats when I ask.\n2. ignores him when he comes to her for love.\n3. wants him to sleep in the kitchen, despite me saying it's too cold. \n4. smacked him twice.\n5. says she's jealous of him.\n6. claims he's annoying despite having three big dogs at her parents' house that she loves.\n7. screams at him to be quiet the second he barks.\n8. feeds him half as much as I do (I don't let her feed him any more) because she thinks he's too big. \n\nSo,  WIBTA if I told her this needs to stop? I've already told her to ignore him completely if she's going to be horrible to him, but she doesn't listen. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation carefully.\n\nSo, the author is a 21-year-old male with a St Bernard named Moose, who's his best friend. The girlfriend, Julia, is 23 and they've been together four months. She lives with her parents, so they spend time at his place. The main issue is how Julia treats Moose.\n\nThe author mentions that Moose is very well-behaved. When Julia came over, Moose started acting protective, sitting at his feet. Then, when they sleep over, Julia made Moose leave the room, shouted at him. The author was upset because the shouting could stress Moose. They compromised by leaving the door open. But then Julia continued being harsh\u2014refusing treats, smacking Moose (which the author opposes), making him sleep in a cold kitchen, screaming when he barks, etc. The author feels Julia is jealous of the bond he shares with Moose and is being unfair.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author values his relationship with his dog, Julia is being critical of the dog's behavior and treatment, and the author is standing up for his dog's well-being. The question is whether the author is in the wrong if he tells Julia to stop.\n\nFirst, I need to consider ownership and responsibility. The dog is the author's, so he's responsible for its care and treatment. Julia is a guest in his home, so her behavior towards his dog should respect his rules. The author has set boundaries, but Julia is not following them. He's already tried to compromise, but she's continued actions that he perceives as harmful or disrespectful.\n\nJulia's actions include physical punishment (smacking), ignoring the dog, and changing the dog's routine without consent. The author is concerned about the dog's well-being and emotional state. The fact that Julia is jealous adds another layer, but that doesn't justify her behavior towards someone else's pet.\n\nThe author is trying to address the issues through communication but she's not listening. He's at a point where he's considering ending the relationship if she doesn't stop. In terms of right or wrong, the author is defending his dog's treatment, which he owns. The girlfriend's actions could be seen as overstepping boundaries, especially since she's not the dog's owner. The author isn't in the wrong for standing up for his pet's welfare. Julia's behavior is the main issue here. So the answer should be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
