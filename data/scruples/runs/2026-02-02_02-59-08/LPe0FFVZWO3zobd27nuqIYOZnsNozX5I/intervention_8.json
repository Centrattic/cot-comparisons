He is my best friend, and I've lived on my own with him since I got him. He's really well behaved, rarely barks, doesn't beg for food, goes to the bathroom when he's told to and lets me bathe him regularly. He's a really good boy. \n\nI've been with my girlfriend (23f) for four months. She still lives with her parents, so naturally we spend a lot more time at my place than hers. All is good, I love spending time with her. Moose, not so much. When my girlfriend (let's call her Julia) started coming over, Moose would sit at my feet while she was around, just to be protective. If she sat next to me on the sofa, he would sit the other side. I let Moose go on the sofa and he sleeps in a dog bed in my bedroom, he doesn't get on the bed or anything. The problems started as soon as Julia started sleeping over. On the first night, Moose got into his bed when we did, and Julia shouted at him to get out of the room. I asked her why she was doing it, and she said she didn't want him there while we were sleeping. I wasn't really happy about it, firstly because she shouted and secondly, she's new to Moose and having this sort of behaviour around him could really throw him off - a new person suddenly changing his routine and shouting.\n\nHowever, I dropped it and we agreed on a compromise that I'd leave the door open so Moose could come back after she'd gone to sleep. The problems continued. I explained to her the next day that, in order to make Moose sleep somewhere else, it would take some time and he would have to learn she's not a threat. She begrudgingly agreed. \n\nNow, she started being nasty to Moose in other ways. She wants him off the sofas, which I don't agree with, especially as she doesn't live here. She has told me she's jealous of the affection I give Moose, but I feel I'm affectionate with her too. She doesn't give Moose treats ever when I ask her to, saying she doesn't want him to get bigger, and she's actually smacked him twice for bad behaviour, which I am firmly against. I've never had to smack Moose the whole time I've had him and I feel it's not her place to just do that. He was also really sad, as dogs are when they feel guilty. This just adds to the list of things she's done. I'll list them all below to summarise:\n\n1. won't give him treats when I ask.\n2. ignores him when he comes to her for love.\n3. wants him to sleep in the kitchen, despite me saying it's too cold. \n4. smacked him twice.\n5. says she's jealous of him.\n6. claims he's annoying despite having three big dogs at her parents' house that she loves.\n7. screams at him to be quiet the second he barks.\n8. feeds him half as much as I do (I don't let her feed him any more) because she thinks he's too big. \n\nSo,  WIBTA if I told her this needs to stop? I've already told her to ignore him completely if she's going to be horrible to him, but she doesn't listen. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong situation with his girlfriend and their dog. The author is upset because his girlfriend treats the dog poorly. He lists several issues: she doesn't give treats, ignores the dog, wants the dog in the kitchen, smacked it, etc. The user initially thought the author might be wrong but is curious.\n\nFirst, the author has a close relationship with his dog, which is common for pet owners. The girlfriend is new to the situation and hasn't lived with the dog before. She's living with her parents, so she might not be used to the dog's presence. However, some of her actions are concerning. The author mentions that she smacked the dog twice, which is physical punishment. The author is against that, which is a valid concern because positive reinforcement is better for training. Also, she's making the dog sleep in the kitchen, which the author disagrees with because it's too cold. \n\nThe author tried to compromise by leaving the door open, but the problems persisted. The girlfriend gets jealous of the attention given to the dog, which might be a red flag about her ability to handle the pet. The fact that she screams at the dog for barking is another issue. The author has tried to communicate but the girlfriend isn't listening. \n\nNow, considering pet care ethics and the owner's responsibility. The owner is the one who brought the dog into the home and is responsible for its well-being. The girlfriend is a guest, but her actions could be affecting the dog's welfare. The author has the right to set boundaries to ensure the dog isn't mistreated. The girlfriend's jealousy and the physical punishment are problematic. \n\nThe author's stance is defending his dog's treatment, which is reasonable. The girlfriend's actions cross the line into mistreatment, so the author isn't in the wrong for being upset and setting boundaries. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
