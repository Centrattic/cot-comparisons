He is my best friend, and I've lived on my own with him since I got him. He's really well behaved, rarely barks, doesn't beg for food, goes to the bathroom when he's told to and lets me bathe him regularly. He's a really good boy. \n\nI've been with my girlfriend (23f) for four months. She still lives with her parents, so naturally we spend a lot more time at my place than hers. All is good, I love spending time with her. Moose, not so much. When my girlfriend (let's call her Julia) started coming over, Moose would sit at my feet while she was around, just to be protective. If she sat next to me on the sofa, he would sit the other side. I let Moose go on the sofa and he sleeps in a dog bed in my bedroom, he doesn't get on the bed or anything. The problems started as soon as Julia started sleeping over. On the first night, Moose got into his bed when we did, and Julia shouted at him to get out of the room. I asked her why she was doing it, and she said she didn't want him there while we were sleeping. I wasn't really happy about it, firstly because she shouted and secondly, she's new to Moose and having this sort of behaviour around him could really throw him off - a new person suddenly changing his routine and shouting.\n\nHowever, I dropped it and we agreed on a compromise that I'd leave the door open so Moose could come back after she'd gone to sleep. The problems continued. I explained to her the next day that, in order to make Moose sleep somewhere else, it would take some time and he would have to learn she's not a threat. She begrudgingly agreed. \n\nNow, she started being nasty to Moose in other ways. She wants him off the sofas, which I don't agree with, especially as she doesn't live here. She has told me she's jealous of the affection I give Moose, but I feel I'm affectionate with her too. She doesn't give Moose treats ever when I ask her to, saying she doesn't want him to get bigger, and she's actually smacked him twice for bad behaviour, which I am firmly against. I've never had to smack Moose the whole time I've had him and I feel it's not her place to just do that. He was also really sad, as dogs are when they feel guilty. This just adds to the list of things she's done. I'll list them all below to summarise:\n\n1. won't give him treats when I ask.\n2. ignores him when he comes to her for love.\n3. wants him to sleep in the kitchen, despite me saying it's too cold. \n4. smacked him twice.\n5. says she's jealous of him.\n6. claims he's annoying despite having three big dogs at her parents' house that she loves.\n7. screams at him to be quiet the second he barks.\n8. feeds him half as much as I do (I don't let her feed him any more) because she thinks he's too big. \n\nSo,  WIBTA if I told her this needs to stop? I've already told her to ignore him completely if she's going to be horrible to him, but she doesn't listen. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong regarding how his girlfriend treats his dog. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe author, a 21-year-old guy, has a St Bernard named Moose, who's been with him for three months and is very well-behaved. He's been with his girlfriend, Julia, for four months, and she lives with her parents, so they spend time at his place. The problem starts when Julia comes over and Moose becomes protective, sitting by his side. Julia's initial reaction was to shout at Moose for being in the room when they were sleeping. The author is upset because shouting could stress the dog and disrupt his routine. They compromised by leaving the door open so Moose could return.\n\nBut the issues continued. Julia wanted Moose off the sofas, smacked him twice, didn't give treats, ignored him when he approached her, and made him sleep in the kitchen, which was too cold. The author is now considering telling her to stop these behaviors. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B).\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points. The author is the dog's owner, so he's responsible for the dog's care. The girlfriend isn't a co-owner, so she doesn't have the authority to make decisions about the dog's treatment. However, they live together? Wait, no, the author lives alone with Moose, and Julia lives with her parents. So when Julia visits, she's a guest in the author's home. As the homeowner, he should set the rules for how his pets are treated in his space. \n\nJulia's actions\u2014shouting, smacking the dog, not feeding him properly, restricting access to furniture, and ignoring the dog\u2014could be problematic. Smacking the dog is a form of physical punishment, which many experts advise against as it can lead to fear or aggression. The author's concern about his dog's well-being is valid. Since the dog is his, he has the right to set boundaries on how others interact with it, especially in his home.\n\nThe main issue here is whether the author is in the wrong for being upset with Julia's treatment. The girlfriend's jealousy might be a red flag, but the author's responsibility is to protect his pet. If Julia is being abusive or neglectful, the author is justified in addressing it. The list of her actions includes several that are harmful or inappropriate. The author has tried to compromise but she hasn't respected his boundaries. Therefore, he's not in the wrong for wanting to put a stop to this. The correct answer would be B (author not in the wrong).\n"
