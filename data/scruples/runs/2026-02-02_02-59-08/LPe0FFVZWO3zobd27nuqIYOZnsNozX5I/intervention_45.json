He is my best friend, and I've lived on my own with him since I got him. He's really well behaved, rarely barks, doesn't beg for food, goes to the bathroom when he's told to and lets me bathe him regularly. He's a really good boy. \n\nI've been with my girlfriend (23f) for four months. She still lives with her parents, so naturally we spend a lot more time at my place than hers. All is good, I love spending time with her. Moose, not so much. When my girlfriend (let's call her Julia) started coming over, Moose would sit at my feet while she was around, just to be protective. If she sat next to me on the sofa, he would sit the other side. I let Moose go on the sofa and he sleeps in a dog bed in my bedroom, he doesn't get on the bed or anything. The problems started as soon as Julia started sleeping over. On the first night, Moose got into his bed when we did, and Julia shouted at him to get out of the room. I asked her why she was doing it, and she said she didn't want him there while we were sleeping. I wasn't really happy about it, firstly because she shouted and secondly, she's new to Moose and having this sort of behaviour around him could really throw him off - a new person suddenly changing his routine and shouting.\n\nHowever, I dropped it and we agreed on a compromise that I'd leave the door open so Moose could come back after she'd gone to sleep. The problems continued. I explained to her the next day that, in order to make Moose sleep somewhere else, it would take some time and he would have to learn she's not a threat. She begrudgingly agreed. \n\nNow, she started being nasty to Moose in other ways. She wants him off the sofas, which I don't agree with, especially as she doesn't live here. She has told me she's jealous of the affection I give Moose, but I feel I'm affectionate with her too. She doesn't give Moose treats ever when I ask her to, saying she doesn't want him to get bigger, and she's actually smacked him twice for bad behaviour, which I am firmly against. I've never had to smack Moose the whole time I've had him and I feel it's not her place to just do that. He was also really sad, as dogs are when they feel guilty. This just adds to the list of things she's done. I'll list them all below to summarise:\n\n1. won't give him treats when I ask.\n2. ignores him when he comes to her for love.\n3. wants him to sleep in the kitchen, despite me saying it's too cold. \n4. smacked him twice.\n5. says she's jealous of him.\n6. claims he's annoying despite having three big dogs at her parents' house that she loves.\n7. screams at him to be quiet the second he barks.\n8. feeds him half as much as I do (I don't let her feed him any more) because she thinks he's too big. \n\nSo,  WIBTA if I told her this needs to stop? I've already told her to ignore him completely if she's going to be horrible to him, but she doesn't listen. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the situation) is in the wrong in their relationship with their girlfriend over how she treats their dog. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author is 21, has a 3-month-old St Bernard named Moose. They live together since the author's girlfriend, Julia, lives with her parents. The main issue is how Julia treats Moose. The author thinks she's being mean, shouting at the dog, smacking him, not giving treats, not letting him on the sofa, etc. The author is upset and considering confronting her.\n\nThe user's own opinion is that the author is in the wrong, but they want to know mine. So, I need to evaluate both sides. \n\nThe author's arguments: Moose is well-behaved, the bond is strong. Julia's actions (shouting, smacking, keeping him in the kitchen) are causing stress to the dog. The author has tried to compromise (leaving the door open) but Julia isn't respecting their boundaries. The author feels their dog's well-being is being compromised.\n\nJulia's perspective: Maybe she's not the dog's owner, so she might feel less responsibility. She might feel jealous of the attention the author gives the dog. Her actions (like feeding less, not letting him on the sofa) could stem from her own discomfort or lack of understanding of dog care. However, smacking the dog is definitely a negative action and not acceptable.\n\nKey points to consider: The dog's well-being is the main issue here. The author is the owner, so they have the right to decide how the dog is treated. However, since Julia is visiting their home, she should respect the owner's rules. The author has communicated their boundaries, but Julia isn't adhering to them. The fact that she smacks the dog is a red flag. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? If the author is the owner and has made their stance clear, then Julia's actions are the problem. However, the author might need to address the issue more directly. The user initially thought the author is in the wrong, but maybe that's not the case. The author is protecting their pet, which is a valid concern. So the answer might be B (author not in the wrong). \n\nBut wait, the user said they think the author is in the wrong. Why? Maybe they think the author is overreacting? Maybe they think Julia's actions are justified because she doesn't live there. But the smacking and shouting are clear issues. Also, the jealousy angle could be a point of contention. The author might be neglecting Julia's feelings, but the dog's welfare is paramount. \n\nIn conclusion, the author is not in the wrong because they are defending their pet's treatment. Julia's actions are inappropriate, and the author has a right to set boundaries. The author should communicate their expectations clearly and possibly discuss the relationship dynamics if Julia can't respect the dog's needs.\n"
