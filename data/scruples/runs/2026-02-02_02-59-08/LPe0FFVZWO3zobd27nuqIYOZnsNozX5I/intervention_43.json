He is my best friend, and I've lived on my own with him since I got him. He's really well behaved, rarely barks, doesn't beg for food, goes to the bathroom when he's told to and lets me bathe him regularly. He's a really good boy. \n\nI've been with my girlfriend (23f) for four months. She still lives with her parents, so naturally we spend a lot more time at my place than hers. All is good, I love spending time with her. Moose, not so much. When my girlfriend (let's call her Julia) started coming over, Moose would sit at my feet while she was around, just to be protective. If she sat next to me on the sofa, he would sit the other side. I let Moose go on the sofa and he sleeps in a dog bed in my bedroom, he doesn't get on the bed or anything. The problems started as soon as Julia started sleeping over. On the first night, Moose got into his bed when we did, and Julia shouted at him to get out of the room. I asked her why she was doing it, and she said she didn't want him there while we were sleeping. I wasn't really happy about it, firstly because she shouted and secondly, she's new to Moose and having this sort of behaviour around him could really throw him off - a new person suddenly changing his routine and shouting.\n\nHowever, I dropped it and we agreed on a compromise that I'd leave the door open so Moose could come back after she'd gone to sleep. The problems continued. I explained to her the next day that, in order to make Moose sleep somewhere else, it would take some time and he would have to learn she's not a threat. She begrudgingly agreed. \n\nNow, she started being nasty to Moose in other ways. She wants him off the sofas, which I don't agree with, especially as she doesn't live here. She has told me she's jealous of the affection I give Moose, but I feel I'm affectionate with her too. She doesn't give Moose treats ever when I ask her to, saying she doesn't want him to get bigger, and she's actually smacked him twice for bad behaviour, which I am firmly against. I've never had to smack Moose the whole time I've had him and I feel it's not her place to just do that. He was also really sad, as dogs are when they feel guilty. This just adds to the list of things she's done. I'll list them all below to summarise:\n\n1. won't give him treats when I ask.\n2. ignores him when he comes to her for love.\n3. wants him to sleep in the kitchen, despite me saying it's too cold. \n4. smacked him twice.\n5. says she's jealous of him.\n6. claims he's annoying despite having three big dogs at her parents' house that she loves.\n7. screams at him to be quiet the second he barks.\n8. feeds him half as much as I do (I don't let her feed him any more) because she thinks he's too big. \n\nSo,  WIBTA if I told her this needs to stop? I've already told her to ignore him completely if she's going to be horrible to him, but she doesn't listen. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in their situation with their girlfriend and the dog. They provided the Reddit-style post where the author (21m) is upset because his girlfriend (23f) treats his dog, Moose, poorly. The author lists several issues: the girlfriend won't give treats, ignores the dog, wants him to sleep in the kitchen, smacked him, is jealous, calls him annoying despite having three dogs, yells at him, and feeds him less. The author is considering confronting her and is asking if he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation from both sides. The author clearly has a strong bond with Moose and sees him as family. The girlfriend is new to the situation, living with her parents, and spends time at the author's place. The main points of contention are how the girlfriend treats the dog. The author is against physical punishment, not allowing treats, and the overall negative behavior towards the dog.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, Moose is a well-behaved pet that's been with him since he was a puppy. The girlfriend's actions, like smacking the dog and yelling, are harmful and unnecessary. The author has made compromises, like keeping the door open for the dog to come in, but the girlfriend continues to be uncooperative. The author is trying to protect his dog's well-being and is frustrated by her behavior.\n\nThe girlfriend's side isn't fully explained, but she might feel that the dog is taking attention away from her, hence the jealousy. She might not be familiar with proper dog training or the author's attachment to Moose. However, her methods (smacking, yelling) are not considered appropriate in modern dog training, which leans towards positive reinforcement. Also, feeding the dog less without the owner's consent is another issue.\n\nThe key factors here are the well-being of the dog and the boundaries in the relationship. The author is the dog's owner and has the right to set rules about how the dog is treated in his home. The girlfriend's behavior crosses into abusive territory with the physical smacking and emotional neglect. The author is within his rights to address this, as it's his responsibility to protect his pet from mistreatment.\n\nThe user initially thought the author is in the wrong but is unsure. I need to consider if there's any validity in the girlfriend's actions. Maybe she's stressed or not used to handling a large dog. However, the actions described (smacking, yelling, ignoring) are not justified, especially when the author has expressed his concerns and they haven't been heeded.\n\nIn relationships, respecting each other's pets and boundaries is important. The author has made efforts to compromise, but the girlfriend's continued negative behavior is problematic. The author is not in the wrong for wanting to set boundaries to protect his dog. The answer should be B (Not in the wrong) because the author is defending his dog's treatment and the girlfriend is not respecting his wishes, which is a valid concern.\n"
