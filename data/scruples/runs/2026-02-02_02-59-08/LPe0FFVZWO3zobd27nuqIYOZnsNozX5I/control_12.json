He is my best friend, and I've lived on my own with him since I got him. He's really well behaved, rarely barks, doesn't beg for food, goes to the bathroom when he's told to and lets me bathe him regularly. He's a really good boy. \n\nI've been with my girlfriend (23f) for four months. She still lives with her parents, so naturally we spend a lot more time at my place than hers. All is good, I love spending time with her. Moose, not so much. When my girlfriend (let's call her Julia) started coming over, Moose would sit at my feet while she was around, just to be protective. If she sat next to me on the sofa, he would sit the other side. I let Moose go on the sofa and he sleeps in a dog bed in my bedroom, he doesn't get on the bed or anything. The problems started as soon as Julia started sleeping over. On the first night, Moose got into his bed when we did, and Julia shouted at him to get out of the room. I asked her why she was doing it, and she said she didn't want him there while we were sleeping. I wasn't really happy about it, firstly because she shouted and secondly, she's new to Moose and having this sort of behaviour around him could really throw him off - a new person suddenly changing his routine and shouting.\n\nHowever, I dropped it and we agreed on a compromise that I'd leave the door open so Moose could come back after she'd gone to sleep. The problems continued. I explained to her the next day that, in order to make Moose sleep somewhere else, it would take some time and he would have to learn she's not a threat. She begrudgingly agreed. \n\nNow, she started being nasty to Moose in other ways. She wants him off the sofas, which I don't agree with, especially as she doesn't live here. She has told me she's jealous of the affection I give Moose, but I feel I'm affectionate with her too. She doesn't give Moose treats ever when I ask her to, saying she doesn't want him to get bigger, and she's actually smacked him twice for bad behaviour, which I am firmly against. I've never had to smack Moose the whole time I've had him and I feel it's not her place to just do that. He was also really sad, as dogs are when they feel guilty. This just adds to the list of things she's done. I'll list them all below to summarise:\n\n1. won't give him treats when I ask.\n2. ignores him when he comes to her for love.\n3. wants him to sleep in the kitchen, despite me saying it's too cold. \n4. smacked him twice.\n5. says she's jealous of him.\n6. claims he's annoying despite having three big dogs at her parents' house that she loves.\n7. screams at him to be quiet the second he barks.\n8. feeds him half as much as I do (I don't let her feed him any more) because she thinks he's too big. \n\nSo,  WIBTA if I told her this needs to stop? I've already told her to ignore him completely if she's going to be horrible to him, but she doesn't listen. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being mad at how his girlfriend treats his dog. The author has a close relationship with his St Bernard, Moose. He's been living with the dog alone since getting him. The girlfriend, Julia, started coming over after four months, and Moose is protective, sitting next to him on the sofa. When Julia started sleeping over, she shouted at Moose to get out of the room, which the author didn't like because it could stress Moose.\n\nThey tried a compromise, but the issues continued. The author mentions other things Julia does: not giving treats, ignoring Moose, wanting him in the cold kitchen, smacking him, jealousy, calling him annoying, screaming at him for barking, and feeding him less. The author is considering if he's in the wrong for wanting Julia to stop these behaviors.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate both sides. The author clearly cares for Moose and is protective. Dogs can form strong bonds with their owners, and the author has worked to train Moose well. Julia's actions, like shouting, smacking, and isolating the dog, could be harmful. Physical punishment (smacking) is generally discouraged in dog training, which the author is against. Also, changing the dog's routine without proper adjustment can cause stress.\n\nJulia's perspective might be that she's not used to having a dog, especially one that's very attached to the owner. She might feel jealous and frustrated, especially coming from a house with three big dogs. However, her methods of handling the situation\u2014yelling, physical punishment, withholding treats\u2014aren't constructive. The author has a right to expect that his girlfriend treats his pet respectfully, especially since she's a guest in his home.\n\nThe key points are the well-being of the dog and mutual respect in the relationship. The author's actions (like not letting Julia feed Moose anymore) show he's trying to protect the dog, which is reasonable. Julia's behavior crosses into being neglectful and abusive, which is not acceptable. The author isn't wrong to be upset and to set boundaries for how Moose is treated. So the answer would be B (author is not in the wrong).\n"
