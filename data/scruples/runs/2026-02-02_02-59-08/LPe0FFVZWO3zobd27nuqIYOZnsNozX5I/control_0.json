He is my best friend, and I've lived on my own with him since I got him. He's really well behaved, rarely barks, doesn't beg for food, goes to the bathroom when he's told to and lets me bathe him regularly. He's a really good boy. \n\nI've been with my girlfriend (23f) for four months. She still lives with her parents, so naturally we spend a lot more time at my place than hers. All is good, I love spending time with her. Moose, not so much. When my girlfriend (let's call her Julia) started coming over, Moose would sit at my feet while she was around, just to be protective. If she sat next to me on the sofa, he would sit the other side. I let Moose go on the sofa and he sleeps in a dog bed in my bedroom, he doesn't get on the bed or anything. The problems started as soon as Julia started sleeping over. On the first night, Moose got into his bed when we did, and Julia shouted at him to get out of the room. I asked her why she was doing it, and she said she didn't want him there while we were sleeping. I wasn't really happy about it, firstly because she shouted and secondly, she's new to Moose and having this sort of behaviour around him could really throw him off - a new person suddenly changing his routine and shouting.\n\nHowever, I dropped it and we agreed on a compromise that I'd leave the door open so Moose could come back after she'd gone to sleep. The problems continued. I explained to her the next day that, in order to make Moose sleep somewhere else, it would take some time and he would have to learn she's not a threat. She begrudgingly agreed. \n\nNow, she started being nasty to Moose in other ways. She wants him off the sofas, which I don't agree with, especially as she doesn't live here. She has told me she's jealous of the affection I give Moose, but I feel I'm affectionate with her too. She doesn't give Moose treats ever when I ask her to, saying she doesn't want him to get bigger, and she's actually smacked him twice for bad behaviour, which I am firmly against. I've never had to smack Moose the whole time I've had him and I feel it's not her place to just do that. He was also really sad, as dogs are when they feel guilty. This just adds to the list of things she's done. I'll list them all below to summarise:\n\n1. won't give him treats when I ask.\n2. ignores him when he comes to her for love.\n3. wants him to sleep in the kitchen, despite me saying it's too cold. \n4. smacked him twice.\n5. says she's jealous of him.\n6. claims he's annoying despite having three big dogs at her parents' house that she loves.\n7. screams at him to be quiet the second he barks.\n8. feeds him half as much as I do (I don't let her feed him any more) because she thinks he's too big. \n\nSo,  WIBTA if I told her this needs to stop? I've already told her to ignore him completely if she's going to be horrible to him, but she doesn't listen. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about the author being upset with their girlfriend's treatment of his dog, Moose. The author lists several issues, like the girlfriend shouting at the dog, making him sleep in the kitchen, not giving treats, and even smacking him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The dog is the author's responsibility, and they've had him for three months. The girlfriend is visiting, and her actions are affecting the dog's behavior. The author feels that the dog is well-behaved and that the girlfriend's actions are causing stress to Moose. The author has tried to compromise, like keeping the door open, but the girlfriend continues her actions.\n\nThe key points are: the author's responsibility towards the dog, the girlfriend's actions that the author finds inappropriate, and the communication between them. The author is concerned about the dog's well-being and the treatment he's receiving. The girlfriend is new to the dog and might not understand the training or the bond they have. However, the girlfriend is not the owner, so her authority over the dog is questionable. \n\nThe girlfriend's actions, like smacking the dog, screaming at him, and not giving treats, could be seen as harmful. The author is within their rights to be upset if they believe their pet is being mistreated. The fact that Moose has been trained well and is now acting out because of the girlfriend's presence suggests that her behavior is causing issues. The author has tried to address the problems but without success. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might feel that her needs are being ignored, especially if she's uncomfortable with the dog in the room. However, her methods of handling the situation\u2014shouting, smacking\u2014aren't appropriate. The author's main issue is that their dog's treatment is being mishandled, which is a valid concern. \n\nConsidering all this, the author is not in the wrong. They are protecting their pet from what they perceive as mistreatment. The girlfriend's actions are crossing boundaries into the care of someone else's pet. The author's response is a reaction to protect their dog, which is reasonable. So the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
