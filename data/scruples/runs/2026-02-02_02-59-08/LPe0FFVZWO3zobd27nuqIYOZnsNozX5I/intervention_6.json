He is my best friend, and I've lived on my own with him since I got him. He's really well behaved, rarely barks, doesn't beg for food, goes to the bathroom when he's told to and lets me bathe him regularly. He's a really good boy. \n\nI've been with my girlfriend (23f) for four months. She still lives with her parents, so naturally we spend a lot more time at my place than hers. All is good, I love spending time with her. Moose, not so much. When my girlfriend (let's call her Julia) started coming over, Moose would sit at my feet while she was around, just to be protective. If she sat next to me on the sofa, he would sit the other side. I let Moose go on the sofa and he sleeps in a dog bed in my bedroom, he doesn't get on the bed or anything. The problems started as soon as Julia started sleeping over. On the first night, Moose got into his bed when we did, and Julia shouted at him to get out of the room. I asked her why she was doing it, and she said she didn't want him there while we were sleeping. I wasn't really happy about it, firstly because she shouted and secondly, she's new to Moose and having this sort of behaviour around him could really throw him off - a new person suddenly changing his routine and shouting.\n\nHowever, I dropped it and we agreed on a compromise that I'd leave the door open so Moose could come back after she'd gone to sleep. The problems continued. I explained to her the next day that, in order to make Moose sleep somewhere else, it would take some time and he would have to learn she's not a threat. She begrudgingly agreed. \n\nNow, she started being nasty to Moose in other ways. She wants him off the sofas, which I don't agree with, especially as she doesn't live here. She has told me she's jealous of the affection I give Moose, but I feel I'm affectionate with her too. She doesn't give Moose treats ever when I ask her to, saying she doesn't want him to get bigger, and she's actually smacked him twice for bad behaviour, which I am firmly against. I've never had to smack Moose the whole time I've had him and I feel it's not her place to just do that. He was also really sad, as dogs are when they feel guilty. This just adds to the list of things she's done. I'll list them all below to summarise:\n\n1. won't give him treats when I ask.\n2. ignores him when he comes to her for love.\n3. wants him to sleep in the kitchen, despite me saying it's too cold. \n4. smacked him twice.\n5. says she's jealous of him.\n6. claims he's annoying despite having three big dogs at her parents' house that she loves.\n7. screams at him to be quiet the second he barks.\n8. feeds him half as much as I do (I don't let her feed him any more) because she thinks he's too big. \n\nSo,  WIBTA if I told her this needs to stop? I've already told her to ignore him completely if she's going to be horrible to him, but she doesn't listen. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in their situation with their girlfriend and their dog. The author thinks they might be right, but they're unsure. They listed several things the girlfriend did that upset them.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author's dog is important to them, and the girlfriend's behavior towards the dog is causing tension. Let's break down the points the author lists. The girlfriend shouts at the dog, wants him off the sofas, refuses treats, hits him, and so on. The author feels these actions are harmful and unnecessary. \n\nThe author mentions that the dog is well-behaved and has a close bond with him. The girlfriend is new to this situation, living with her parents, and maybe not used to living with a dog. But the author has explained their stance and tried compromises. However, the girlfriend continues her behavior despite the author's requests. \n\nThe key issues here are animal cruelty and mutual respect. Smacking the dog is a red flag. The author is the dog's owner and has the right to set boundaries on how the dog is treated. The girlfriend's jealousy and negative treatment could indicate she's not comfortable with the dog's role in the author's life. However, the author is responsible for their pet's well-being. \n\nFrom a societal standpoint, it's important to address any mistreatment of animals. The author isn't wrong for being upset if someone is harming their pet, even if they're in a relationship. The girlfriend's actions, like hitting the dog, are unacceptable regardless of the situation. Also, the author has tried to communicate and compromise, which shows they're not being unreasonable. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might feel that the dog is taking attention away from her, leading to jealousy. But that's not an excuse for mistreating an animal. The author's responsibility here is to protect their pet. It's possible that the girlfriend isn't a suitable partner if she can't respect the author's feelings towards their dog. \n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong for being upset about the treatment of their dog. The girlfriend's actions are inappropriate, and the author is justified in wanting to address the issue. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
