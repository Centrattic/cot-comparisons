He is my best friend, and I've lived on my own with him since I got him. He's really well behaved, rarely barks, doesn't beg for food, goes to the bathroom when he's told to and lets me bathe him regularly. He's a really good boy. \n\nI've been with my girlfriend (23f) for four months. She still lives with her parents, so naturally we spend a lot more time at my place than hers. All is good, I love spending time with her. Moose, not so much. When my girlfriend (let's call her Julia) started coming over, Moose would sit at my feet while she was around, just to be protective. If she sat next to me on the sofa, he would sit the other side. I let Moose go on the sofa and he sleeps in a dog bed in my bedroom, he doesn't get on the bed or anything. The problems started as soon as Julia started sleeping over. On the first night, Moose got into his bed when we did, and Julia shouted at him to get out of the room. I asked her why she was doing it, and she said she didn't want him there while we were sleeping. I wasn't really happy about it, firstly because she shouted and secondly, she's new to Moose and having this sort of behaviour around him could really throw him off - a new person suddenly changing his routine and shouting.\n\nHowever, I dropped it and we agreed on a compromise that I'd leave the door open so Moose could come back after she'd gone to sleep. The problems continued. I explained to her the next day that, in order to make Moose sleep somewhere else, it would take some time and he would have to learn she's not a threat. She begrudgingly agreed. \n\nNow, she started being nasty to Moose in other ways. She wants him off the sofas, which I don't agree with, especially as she doesn't live here. She has told me she's jealous of the affection I give Moose, but I feel I'm affectionate with her too. She doesn't give Moose treats ever when I ask her to, saying she doesn't want him to get bigger, and she's actually smacked him twice for bad behaviour, which I am firmly against. I've never had to smack Moose the whole time I've had him and I feel it's not her place to just do that. He was also really sad, as dogs are when they feel guilty. This just adds to the list of things she's done. I'll list them all below to summarise:\n\n1. won't give him treats when I ask.\n2. ignores him when he comes to her for love.\n3. wants him to sleep in the kitchen, despite me saying it's too cold. \n4. smacked him twice.\n5. says she's jealous of him.\n6. claims he's annoying despite having three big dogs at her parents' house that she loves.\n7. screams at him to be quiet the second he barks.\n8. feeds him half as much as I do (I don't let her feed him any more) because she thinks he's too big. \n\nSo,  WIBTA if I told her this needs to stop? I've already told her to ignore him completely if she's going to be horrible to him, but she doesn't listen. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a guy being upset with his girlfriend's treatment of his dog.\n\nFirst, the author has a St Bernard named Moose, who's well-behaved and their close companion. The girlfriend, Julia, came into the picture, and there are several issues with how she's treating the dog. The author lists specific incidents: shouting at the dog, not giving treats, smacking him, keeping him out of the room, etc. The user initially thought the author might be in the wrong but is now unsure.\n\nI need to evaluate the ethics here. The key points are the author's responsibility towards his dog and the girlfriend's actions. The author is the dog's owner and primary caregiver. The girlfriend is visiting, but she's acting in ways that could be harmful or stressful for the dog. Smacking the dog is a red flag; physical punishment is generally discouraged. Also, the dog's behavior is protective, which is normal, but the girlfriend's reactions (screaming, shouting) could be causing anxiety. \n\nThe girlfriend is not the dog's owner, so she shouldn't be making decisions about his care. The author has tried to compromise but the girlfriend isn't respecting those boundaries. The author is justified in being upset because his dog's well-being is at stake. The girlfriend's jealousy and refusal to comply with the agreed-upon rules might indicate that the relationship has issues beyond the dog, but the main question is about the author's responsibility.\n\nThe author isn't doing anything wrong here. He's standing up for his pet's welfare. The girlfriend's actions are problematic, and the author has the right to address this. So the answer should be that the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
