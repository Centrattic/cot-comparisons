He is my best friend, and I've lived on my own with him since I got him. He's really well behaved, rarely barks, doesn't beg for food, goes to the bathroom when he's told to and lets me bathe him regularly. He's a really good boy. \n\nI've been with my girlfriend (23f) for four months. She still lives with her parents, so naturally we spend a lot more time at my place than hers. All is good, I love spending time with her. Moose, not so much. When my girlfriend (let's call her Julia) started coming over, Moose would sit at my feet while she was around, just to be protective. If she sat next to me on the sofa, he would sit the other side. I let Moose go on the sofa and he sleeps in a dog bed in my bedroom, he doesn't get on the bed or anything. The problems started as soon as Julia started sleeping over. On the first night, Moose got into his bed when we did, and Julia shouted at him to get out of the room. I asked her why she was doing it, and she said she didn't want him there while we were sleeping. I wasn't really happy about it, firstly because she shouted and secondly, she's new to Moose and having this sort of behaviour around him could really throw him off - a new person suddenly changing his routine and shouting.\n\nHowever, I dropped it and we agreed on a compromise that I'd leave the door open so Moose could come back after she'd gone to sleep. The problems continued. I explained to her the next day that, in order to make Moose sleep somewhere else, it would take some time and he would have to learn she's not a threat. She begrudgingly agreed. \n\nNow, she started being nasty to Moose in other ways. She wants him off the sofas, which I don't agree with, especially as she doesn't live here. She has told me she's jealous of the affection I give Moose, but I feel I'm affectionate with her too. She doesn't give Moose treats ever when I ask her to, saying she doesn't want him to get bigger, and she's actually smacked him twice for bad behaviour, which I am firmly against. I've never had to smack Moose the whole time I've had him and I feel it's not her place to just do that. He was also really sad, as dogs are when they feel guilty. This just adds to the list of things she's done. I'll list them all below to summarise:\n\n1. won't give him treats when I ask.\n2. ignores him when he comes to her for love.\n3. wants him to sleep in the kitchen, despite me saying it's too cold. \n4. smacked him twice.\n5. says she's jealous of him.\n6. claims he's annoying despite having three big dogs at her parents' house that she loves.\n7. screams at him to be quiet the second he barks.\n8. feeds him half as much as I do (I don't let her feed him any more) because she thinks he's too big. \n\nSo,  WIBTA if I told her this needs to stop? I've already told her to ignore him completely if she's going to be horrible to him, but she doesn't listen. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a guy who's upset with his girlfriend for how she treats his dog. The dog is a big part of his life, and he's been living with the dog since it was a puppy. The girlfriend, Julia, started coming over, and the dog was being protective by sitting near him. Then things escalated when Julia started sleeping over and made the dog sleep in the kitchen, shouted at him, and even hit him twice. The guy is frustrated because he thinks she's being cruel to the dog and is jealous.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dog's well-being. The author is the dog's owner and primary caregiver. He's been raising the dog for three months, and the dog is well-behaved. The girlfriend's actions\u2014hitting the dog, not giving treats, isolating the dog in a cold kitchen, and shouting\u2014are clearly harmful. Physical punishment like smacking is a red flag for animal cruelty, even if it's not illegal in some places. The dog's emotional state is also affected, as the owner noticed the dog feeling guilty or sad, which is a sign of stress.\n\nThen there's the issue of boundaries. Julia doesn't live in the author's home, so her control over the dog's treatment might be overstepping. The author has made it clear that he doesn't want the dog to be smacked or isolated in the kitchen. The girlfriend's insistence on these actions despite the author's objections shows a lack of respect for his wishes and the dog's needs.\n\nJealousy is another point. The girlfriend admitting to being jealous of the affection given to the dog suggests insecurity in the relationship. However, that doesn't justify her behavior towards the dog. The author should address the underlying issues of her jealousy, but that's separate from the immediate problem of how she's treating the dog.\n\nThe author has tried to compromise, like keeping the door open so the dog can come back to the room. But the girlfriend continues to act in ways that are harmful. The author's concern for the dog's well-being is valid. If he stops the behavior, he's protecting his pet, which is his responsibility as the owner. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might need to communicate more effectively. However, given that the girlfriend has already violated the agreed-upon compromises and the dog is being harmed, the author isn't wrong in wanting to address this. The main issue is the girlfriend's actions towards the dog, not the author's feelings about his dog. The author is in the right to stand up for his dog's treatment, especially since the dog is his responsibility and the girlfriend's actions are harmful.\n"
