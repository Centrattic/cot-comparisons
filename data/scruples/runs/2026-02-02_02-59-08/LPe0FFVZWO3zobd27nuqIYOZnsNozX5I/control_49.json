He is my best friend, and I've lived on my own with him since I got him. He's really well behaved, rarely barks, doesn't beg for food, goes to the bathroom when he's told to and lets me bathe him regularly. He's a really good boy. \n\nI've been with my girlfriend (23f) for four months. She still lives with her parents, so naturally we spend a lot more time at my place than hers. All is good, I love spending time with her. Moose, not so much. When my girlfriend (let's call her Julia) started coming over, Moose would sit at my feet while she was around, just to be protective. If she sat next to me on the sofa, he would sit the other side. I let Moose go on the sofa and he sleeps in a dog bed in my bedroom, he doesn't get on the bed or anything. The problems started as soon as Julia started sleeping over. On the first night, Moose got into his bed when we did, and Julia shouted at him to get out of the room. I asked her why she was doing it, and she said she didn't want him there while we were sleeping. I wasn't really happy about it, firstly because she shouted and secondly, she's new to Moose and having this sort of behaviour around him could really throw him off - a new person suddenly changing his routine and shouting.\n\nHowever, I dropped it and we agreed on a compromise that I'd leave the door open so Moose could come back after she'd gone to sleep. The problems continued. I explained to her the next day that, in order to make Moose sleep somewhere else, it would take some time and he would have to learn she's not a threat. She begrudgingly agreed. \n\nNow, she started being nasty to Moose in other ways. She wants him off the sofas, which I don't agree with, especially as she doesn't live here. She has told me she's jealous of the affection I give Moose, but I feel I'm affectionate with her too. She doesn't give Moose treats ever when I ask her to, saying she doesn't want him to get bigger, and she's actually smacked him twice for bad behaviour, which I am firmly against. I've never had to smack Moose the whole time I've had him and I feel it's not her place to just do that. He was also really sad, as dogs are when they feel guilty. This just adds to the list of things she's done. I'll list them all below to summarise:\n\n1. won't give him treats when I ask.\n2. ignores him when he comes to her for love.\n3. wants him to sleep in the kitchen, despite me saying it's too cold. \n4. smacked him twice.\n5. says she's jealous of him.\n6. claims he's annoying despite having three big dogs at her parents' house that she loves.\n7. screams at him to be quiet the second he barks.\n8. feeds him half as much as I do (I don't let her feed him any more) because she thinks he's too big. \n\nSo,  WIBTA if I told her this needs to stop? I've already told her to ignore him completely if she's going to be horrible to him, but she doesn't listen. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being upset about how his girlfriend treats his dog. Let's look at the key points from the scenario.\n\nFirst, the author has a St Bernard named Moose, who's well-behaved and they have a close bond. The girlfriend, Julia, is new to the situation and they spend a lot of time at his place. The main issues are how Julia is interacting with the dog: shouting, smacking, not allowing him on the sofa, feeding him less, etc. The author is upset about these actions and wants to address them.\n\nNow, considering the responsibilities involved. The dog is the author's, and he's the one responsible for Moose's care. Julia is visiting his home, so her actions there could be seen as overstepping if she's not a co-owner. The author mentions that Julia is being physically punitive (smacking), which he opposes. Also, she's not following his instructions regarding the dog's treatment, like feeding and sleeping arrangements. \n\nPhysical punishment like smacking is generally not recommended for dogs and can lead to fear or aggression. The author is against it, so Julia's actions here are problematic. Additionally, the fact that Julia is jealous of the attention given to Moose might indicate underlying relationship issues, but that's more about their dynamic rather than the dog's welfare directly.\n\nThe author is standing up for his dog, which is his responsibility. He's tried to compromise (like leaving the door open) but the issues persist. Since the dog is his, he should have the final say on how Moose is treated in his home. Julia's actions are affecting the dog's well-being, so the author isn't wrong to be upset. The answer hinges on whether the author's actions (being angry and wanting to set boundaries) are justified. Given that he's the pet owner and she's not respecting his wishes and the dog's needs, he's not in the wrong.\n"
