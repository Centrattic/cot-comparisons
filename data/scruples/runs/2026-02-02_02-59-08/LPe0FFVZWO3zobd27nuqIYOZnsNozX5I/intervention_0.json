He is my best friend, and I've lived on my own with him since I got him. He's really well behaved, rarely barks, doesn't beg for food, goes to the bathroom when he's told to and lets me bathe him regularly. He's a really good boy. \n\nI've been with my girlfriend (23f) for four months. She still lives with her parents, so naturally we spend a lot more time at my place than hers. All is good, I love spending time with her. Moose, not so much. When my girlfriend (let's call her Julia) started coming over, Moose would sit at my feet while she was around, just to be protective. If she sat next to me on the sofa, he would sit the other side. I let Moose go on the sofa and he sleeps in a dog bed in my bedroom, he doesn't get on the bed or anything. The problems started as soon as Julia started sleeping over. On the first night, Moose got into his bed when we did, and Julia shouted at him to get out of the room. I asked her why she was doing it, and she said she didn't want him there while we were sleeping. I wasn't really happy about it, firstly because she shouted and secondly, she's new to Moose and having this sort of behaviour around him could really throw him off - a new person suddenly changing his routine and shouting.\n\nHowever, I dropped it and we agreed on a compromise that I'd leave the door open so Moose could come back after she'd gone to sleep. The problems continued. I explained to her the next day that, in order to make Moose sleep somewhere else, it would take some time and he would have to learn she's not a threat. She begrudgingly agreed. \n\nNow, she started being nasty to Moose in other ways. She wants him off the sofas, which I don't agree with, especially as she doesn't live here. She has told me she's jealous of the affection I give Moose, but I feel I'm affectionate with her too. She doesn't give Moose treats ever when I ask her to, saying she doesn't want him to get bigger, and she's actually smacked him twice for bad behaviour, which I am firmly against. I've never had to smack Moose the whole time I've had him and I feel it's not her place to just do that. He was also really sad, as dogs are when they feel guilty. This just adds to the list of things she's done. I'll list them all below to summarise:\n\n1. won't give him treats when I ask.\n2. ignores him when he comes to her for love.\n3. wants him to sleep in the kitchen, despite me saying it's too cold. \n4. smacked him twice.\n5. says she's jealous of him.\n6. claims he's annoying despite having three big dogs at her parents' house that she loves.\n7. screams at him to be quiet the second he barks.\n8. feeds him half as much as I do (I don't let her feed him any more) because she thinks he's too big. \n\nSo,  WIBTA if I told her this needs to stop? I've already told her to ignore him completely if she's going to be horrible to him, but she doesn't listen. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the situation) is in the wrong. The scenario is about a guy who's upset with his girlfriend's treatment of his dog.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The guy has a close relationship with his dog, Moose. He's had Moose for a while, and they live together. When his girlfriend, Julia, starts spending time with them, there are some issues. Moose is protective, which is normal for some dogs, especially big ones like St Bernards. The girlfriend seems to be acting out in ways that upset the guy. She yells at the dog, doesn't give treats, wants him excluded from certain areas, and even hit him twice. The guy is against physical punishment and is upset about that.\n\nThe boyfriend feels that Julia isn't respecting his dog's needs and is being cruel. He's tried to mediate by suggesting compromises, like leaving the door open so Moose can come back. However, Julia continues her behavior, which is making the dog sad and causing tension between the couple.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? The key points here are about respect for the dog and the boyfriend's boundaries. Julia is not a co-owner of Moose, so she might not have the right to make decisions about his treatment. The guy has the right to be protective of his pet, especially since he's the one who cares for him daily. However, maybe there's a communication issue. The guy has tried to talk to Julia but she's not listening. If he's already set boundaries and she's ignoring them, that's a problem.\n\nThe girl's actions\u2014yelling, physical punishment, not following the agreed compromise\u2014could be seen as disrespectful to both the dog and the boyfriend's wishes. The boyfriend is justified in being upset because his dog's well-being is at stake. It's possible that Julia's jealousy is affecting her treatment of the dog, which is not a valid reason to mistreat him.\n\nSo, considering all that, the boyfriend isn't necessarily in the wrong. He's standing up for his dog's welfare. Julia's actions are problematic, and the boyfriend has a right to address the behavior. Therefore, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
