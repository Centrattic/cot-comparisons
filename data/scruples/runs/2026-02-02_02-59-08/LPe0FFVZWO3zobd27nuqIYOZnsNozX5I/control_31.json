He is my best friend, and I've lived on my own with him since I got him. He's really well behaved, rarely barks, doesn't beg for food, goes to the bathroom when he's told to and lets me bathe him regularly. He's a really good boy. \n\nI've been with my girlfriend (23f) for four months. She still lives with her parents, so naturally we spend a lot more time at my place than hers. All is good, I love spending time with her. Moose, not so much. When my girlfriend (let's call her Julia) started coming over, Moose would sit at my feet while she was around, just to be protective. If she sat next to me on the sofa, he would sit the other side. I let Moose go on the sofa and he sleeps in a dog bed in my bedroom, he doesn't get on the bed or anything. The problems started as soon as Julia started sleeping over. On the first night, Moose got into his bed when we did, and Julia shouted at him to get out of the room. I asked her why she was doing it, and she said she didn't want him there while we were sleeping. I wasn't really happy about it, firstly because she shouted and secondly, she's new to Moose and having this sort of behaviour around him could really throw him off - a new person suddenly changing his routine and shouting.\n\nHowever, I dropped it and we agreed on a compromise that I'd leave the door open so Moose could come back after she'd gone to sleep. The problems continued. I explained to her the next day that, in order to make Moose sleep somewhere else, it would take some time and he would have to learn she's not a threat. She begrudgingly agreed. \n\nNow, she started being nasty to Moose in other ways. She wants him off the sofas, which I don't agree with, especially as she doesn't live here. She has told me she's jealous of the affection I give Moose, but I feel I'm affectionate with her too. She doesn't give Moose treats ever when I ask her to, saying she doesn't want him to get bigger, and she's actually smacked him twice for bad behaviour, which I am firmly against. I've never had to smack Moose the whole time I've had him and I feel it's not her place to just do that. He was also really sad, as dogs are when they feel guilty. This just adds to the list of things she's done. I'll list them all below to summarise:\n\n1. won't give him treats when I ask.\n2. ignores him when he comes to her for love.\n3. wants him to sleep in the kitchen, despite me saying it's too cold. \n4. smacked him twice.\n5. says she's jealous of him.\n6. claims he's annoying despite having three big dogs at her parents' house that she loves.\n7. screams at him to be quiet the second he barks.\n8. feeds him half as much as I do (I don't let her feed him any more) because she thinks he's too big. \n\nSo,  WIBTA if I told her this needs to stop? I've already told her to ignore him completely if she's going to be horrible to him, but she doesn't listen. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being upset about how his girlfriend treats his dog. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author and his girlfriend have been together four months. The dog, Moose, is three months old and has been living with the author. They have a close bond, and the dog is well-behaved. When the girlfriend started visiting, Moose became protective, sitting at the author's feet. That's normal for a dog to do when meeting new people, especially if they're close to their owner.\n\nThe first issue is the girlfriend shouting at the dog to get out of the room. The author is upset because shouting can be stressful for the dog. He compromises by leaving the door open. But then the girlfriend continues being harsh, smacking the dog, not giving treats, making Moose sleep in the cold kitchen, etc. The author has tried talking to her but she doesn't listen.\n\nNow, the key points here are the treatment of the dog. The author is against physical punishment, which is a valid stance. Smacking a dog can lead to fear and aggression. The girlfriend's actions\u2014smacking twice, not providing proper care, yelling\u2014are all forms of mistreatment. The author is concerned about the dog's well-being and has communicated his concerns, but she's not respecting his wishes.\n\nThe girlfriend is a guest in the author's home, so she doesn't have the same responsibilities as a cohabitant. The fact that she's making decisions about the dog's care without the owner's consent is problematic. The author is the owner and has the right to set the rules for his pet's treatment. Her jealousy over the affection given to the dog might be a red flag in the relationship, indicating possible insecurity or possessiveness.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. He's standing up for his dog's welfare and has made it clear what is and isn't acceptable. The girlfriend's behavior crosses into mistreatment, and the author is justified in wanting to address it. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
