He is my best friend, and I've lived on my own with him since I got him. He's really well behaved, rarely barks, doesn't beg for food, goes to the bathroom when he's told to and lets me bathe him regularly. He's a really good boy. \n\nI've been with my girlfriend (23f) for four months. She still lives with her parents, so naturally we spend a lot more time at my place than hers. All is good, I love spending time with her. Moose, not so much. When my girlfriend (let's call her Julia) started coming over, Moose would sit at my feet while she was around, just to be protective. If she sat next to me on the sofa, he would sit the other side. I let Moose go on the sofa and he sleeps in a dog bed in my bedroom, he doesn't get on the bed or anything. The problems started as soon as Julia started sleeping over. On the first night, Moose got into his bed when we did, and Julia shouted at him to get out of the room. I asked her why she was doing it, and she said she didn't want him there while we were sleeping. I wasn't really happy about it, firstly because she shouted and secondly, she's new to Moose and having this sort of behaviour around him could really throw him off - a new person suddenly changing his routine and shouting.\n\nHowever, I dropped it and we agreed on a compromise that I'd leave the door open so Moose could come back after she'd gone to sleep. The problems continued. I explained to her the next day that, in order to make Moose sleep somewhere else, it would take some time and he would have to learn she's not a threat. She begrudgingly agreed. \n\nNow, she started being nasty to Moose in other ways. She wants him off the sofas, which I don't agree with, especially as she doesn't live here. She has told me she's jealous of the affection I give Moose, but I feel I'm affectionate with her too. She doesn't give Moose treats ever when I ask her to, saying she doesn't want him to get bigger, and she's actually smacked him twice for bad behaviour, which I am firmly against. I've never had to smack Moose the whole time I've had him and I feel it's not her place to just do that. He was also really sad, as dogs are when they feel guilty. This just adds to the list of things she's done. I'll list them all below to summarise:\n\n1. won't give him treats when I ask.\n2. ignores him when he comes to her for love.\n3. wants him to sleep in the kitchen, despite me saying it's too cold. \n4. smacked him twice.\n5. says she's jealous of him.\n6. claims he's annoying despite having three big dogs at her parents' house that she loves.\n7. screams at him to be quiet the second he barks.\n8. feeds him half as much as I do (I don't let her feed him any more) because she thinks he's too big. \n\nSo,  WIBTA if I told her this needs to stop? I've already told her to ignore him completely if she's going to be horrible to him, but she doesn't listen. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nThe author is a guy in a four-month relationship with his girlfriend Julia. He has a St Bernard named Moose, who's 3 months old. They live together, and Moose is very well-behaved. The problem starts when Julia comes over. Moose is protective, sitting next to him when she's around. Initially, Julia shouts at Moose to get out of the room when they sleep, which the author is upset about because of the shouting and the potential stress to the dog. They compromise with leaving the door open. But then Julia does other things like not giving treats, smacking Moose, wanting him to sleep in the kitchen (which is cold), and being generally harsh with him. The author is mad and lists several issues. He's considering telling her it needs to stop. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, let's break down the key points. Moose is the author's dog, and he's the one responsible for his care. Julia is a new person in his life and is visiting his place. The main issues are Julia's treatment of the dog. The author is upset about her shouting, smacking the dog, not giving treats, etc. The author is trying to mediate, like compromising on the sleeping arrangement, but Julia isn't following through. \n\nNow, considering the responsibilities here. The dog is the author's, so the primary responsibility for the dog's well-being is his. However, Julia is visiting, and maybe there's some conflict because she's not used to Moose's behavior. But the way she's reacting seems harsh. Shouting at the dog, smacking it, restricting treats\u2014these are actions that could be harmful. The author is trying to explain that the dog is well-behaved and that his routines shouldn't be disrupted by Julia's presence. \n\nIs the author overreacting? Maybe Julia is having her own issues, but the dog isn't hers, so she should respect his care and the environment. If she's not following the agreed-upon rules, like not smacking the dog, not giving treats, then the author has a right to be upset. He's also tried to compromise, which shows he's trying to find a middle ground. \n\nBut some might argue that Julia is also new to the household and has her own preferences, like not wanting the dog in certain areas. However, since the dog isn't hers, she shouldn't impose her rules without considering his ownership. The author's main point is that Julia's actions are negatively affecting the dog's well-being and their relationship. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the user initially thought the author is in the wrong, but I need to see if that's accurate. The author is defending his dog, which is his responsibility. If Julia is mistreating the dog, then the author isn't in the wrong for being upset. The question is whether he's justified in his reaction. Since the dog's welfare is a priority, and Julia is acting in ways that could be harmful, the author is justified in wanting her to stop. So the answer would be B (author not in the wrong). But wait, maybe some might think the author should have addressed things differently, but the core issue is Julia's treatment of the dog. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
