He is my best friend, and I've lived on my own with him since I got him. He's really well behaved, rarely barks, doesn't beg for food, goes to the bathroom when he's told to and lets me bathe him regularly. He's a really good boy. \n\nI've been with my girlfriend (23f) for four months. She still lives with her parents, so naturally we spend a lot more time at my place than hers. All is good, I love spending time with her. Moose, not so much. When my girlfriend (let's call her Julia) started coming over, Moose would sit at my feet while she was around, just to be protective. If she sat next to me on the sofa, he would sit the other side. I let Moose go on the sofa and he sleeps in a dog bed in my bedroom, he doesn't get on the bed or anything. The problems started as soon as Julia started sleeping over. On the first night, Moose got into his bed when we did, and Julia shouted at him to get out of the room. I asked her why she was doing it, and she said she didn't want him there while we were sleeping. I wasn't really happy about it, firstly because she shouted and secondly, she's new to Moose and having this sort of behaviour around him could really throw him off - a new person suddenly changing his routine and shouting.\n\nHowever, I dropped it and we agreed on a compromise that I'd leave the door open so Moose could come back after she'd gone to sleep. The problems continued. I explained to her the next day that, in order to make Moose sleep somewhere else, it would take some time and he would have to learn she's not a threat. She begrudgingly agreed. \n\nNow, she started being nasty to Moose in other ways. She wants him off the sofas, which I don't agree with, especially as she doesn't live here. She has told me she's jealous of the affection I give Moose, but I feel I'm affectionate with her too. She doesn't give Moose treats ever when I ask her to, saying she doesn't want him to get bigger, and she's actually smacked him twice for bad behaviour, which I am firmly against. I've never had to smack Moose the whole time I've had him and I feel it's not her place to just do that. He was also really sad, as dogs are when they feel guilty. This just adds to the list of things she's done. I'll list them all below to summarise:\n\n1. won't give him treats when I ask.\n2. ignores him when he comes to her for love.\n3. wants him to sleep in the kitchen, despite me saying it's too cold. \n4. smacked him twice.\n5. says she's jealous of him.\n6. claims he's annoying despite having three big dogs at her parents' house that she loves.\n7. screams at him to be quiet the second he barks.\n8. feeds him half as much as I do (I don't let her feed him any more) because she thinks he's too big. \n\nSo,  WIBTA if I told her this needs to stop? I've already told her to ignore him completely if she's going to be horrible to him, but she doesn't listen. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being mad at how his girlfriend treats his dog. The situation is that the author has a dog named Moose, who he's very close to. He's lived with the dog since it was a puppy and they have a good, well-behaved relationship. The girlfriend, Julia, has been coming over since they've been dating for four months. The main issues are how she treats the dog: shouting, making him sleep in the kitchen, not giving treats, and even smacking him.\n\nThe author feels that Julia's actions are negative and wants to address it. He's listed several issues where she's been mean to the dog. He's already tried to compromise by leaving the door open so Moose can come back. But Julia continues her behavior. The author is considering confronting her about it, but he's worried if he's overreacting.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. Let me break down the key points. The dog is his responsibility, and he's the owner. Julia is a guest in his home, so her behavior there is under his control. The fact that she's not living there but still imposing her rules on the dog's treatment might be problematic. The author has a close bond with the dog, and it's reasonable for him to be protective.\n\nJulia's actions include shouting at the dog, which can be stressful for the animal. Smacking the dog is physical punishment, which the author opposes, and the owner's judgment on training methods is valid. The dog's well-being is a priority here. The author's attempts to address the issues have been ignored, so he's justified in wanting to end the relationship if she doesn't change her ways. \n\nHowever, the author should consider communication. Maybe he hasn't communicated his boundaries clearly enough. But given the persistence of her negative behavior despite his efforts, it's reasonable for him to take a stand. The dog's welfare is a key factor here. The girlfriend's jealousy and her own experience with dogs at her parents might be part of her perspective, but that doesn't justify mistreating another person's pet.\n\nIn terms of rights and responsibilities, the homeowner has the authority over the pet's treatment in their home. The girlfriend's actions are within the home where the owner lives, so the owner's expectations for the pet's treatment are valid. The author isn't in the wrong for standing up for his dog's treatment. So, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
