He is my best friend, and I've lived on my own with him since I got him. He's really well behaved, rarely barks, doesn't beg for food, goes to the bathroom when he's told to and lets me bathe him regularly. He's a really good boy. \n\nI've been with my girlfriend (23f) for four months. She still lives with her parents, so naturally we spend a lot more time at my place than hers. All is good, I love spending time with her. Moose, not so much. When my girlfriend (let's call her Julia) started coming over, Moose would sit at my feet while she was around, just to be protective. If she sat next to me on the sofa, he would sit the other side. I let Moose go on the sofa and he sleeps in a dog bed in my bedroom, he doesn't get on the bed or anything. The problems started as soon as Julia started sleeping over. On the first night, Moose got into his bed when we did, and Julia shouted at him to get out of the room. I asked her why she was doing it, and she said she didn't want him there while we were sleeping. I wasn't really happy about it, firstly because she shouted and secondly, she's new to Moose and having this sort of behaviour around him could really throw him off - a new person suddenly changing his routine and shouting.\n\nHowever, I dropped it and we agreed on a compromise that I'd leave the door open so Moose could come back after she'd gone to sleep. The problems continued. I explained to her the next day that, in order to make Moose sleep somewhere else, it would take some time and he would have to learn she's not a threat. She begrudgingly agreed. \n\nNow, she started being nasty to Moose in other ways. She wants him off the sofas, which I don't agree with, especially as she doesn't live here. She has told me she's jealous of the affection I give Moose, but I feel I'm affectionate with her too. She doesn't give Moose treats ever when I ask her to, saying she doesn't want him to get bigger, and she's actually smacked him twice for bad behaviour, which I am firmly against. I've never had to smack Moose the whole time I've had him and I feel it's not her place to just do that. He was also really sad, as dogs are when they feel guilty. This just adds to the list of things she's done. I'll list them all below to summarise:\n\n1. won't give him treats when I ask.\n2. ignores him when he comes to her for love.\n3. wants him to sleep in the kitchen, despite me saying it's too cold. \n4. smacked him twice.\n5. says she's jealous of him.\n6. claims he's annoying despite having three big dogs at her parents' house that she loves.\n7. screams at him to be quiet the second he barks.\n8. feeds him half as much as I do (I don't let her feed him any more) because she thinks he's too big. \n\nSo,  WIBTA if I told her this needs to stop? I've already told her to ignore him completely if she's going to be horrible to him, but she doesn't listen. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in their situation with their girlfriend and dog.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author has a St Bernard named Moose, who's well-behaved. They've been living together alone since Moose was a puppy, so they have a strong bond. Then the girlfriend comes into the picture. The author is spending a lot of time with her, and she's coming to his place. Moose starts showing protective behavior, like sitting next to the author when she's there. \n\nThe problems start when the girlfriend tells Moose to get out of the room when they sleep, shouting at him. The author is upset because that could stress the dog. They compromise by leaving the door open. But then the girlfriend continues being negative towards Moose in various ways: not giving treats, smacking him, keeping him in a cold kitchen, etc. The author has tried to talk to her but she doesn't listen, leading to the question if he's in the wrong.\n\nNow, the key points here are about the treatment of the dog. The author is clearly the dog's owner and has raised Moose, so he has a strong emotional attachment. The girlfriend's actions include shouting, smacking the dog, and refusing to follow the owner's wishes regarding the dog's care. \n\nThe girlfriend's actions can be considered abusive if she's smacking the dog for bad behavior. The author mentions he's never had to do that, and physical punishment isn't appropriate for dogs. Also, withholding treats without a valid reason, not allowing the dog to be on the sofa when it's allowed, moving the dog to a cold area against the owner's advice, and showing jealousy might be valid points in the author's argument.\n\nThe girlfriend's behavior could be seen as violating the author's boundaries regarding his pet. The author has made it clear that he's against smacking the dog and that Moose should have certain privileges. If she's not respecting his decisions on how to care for his dog, that's a problem. Additionally, her jealousy and the way she's treating the dog could indicate she's not respectful of the author's relationship with his pet, which is a significant issue in their relationship.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author could have set clearer boundaries from the start. However, he did try to communicate and compromise. The girlfriend's actions are ongoing and not improving despite his efforts. The author is protecting his dog's well-being, which is a valid concern. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the girlfriend is a guest in the author's home. She doesn't live there, so she shouldn't have authority over how the pet is treated. The author is the one responsible for the dog's care, so he's within his rights to be upset when someone else is mistreating his pet, especially if they're his partner now.\n\nSo putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. He's defending his dog's well-being against someone who's not respecting his decisions. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
