He is my best friend, and I've lived on my own with him since I got him. He's really well behaved, rarely barks, doesn't beg for food, goes to the bathroom when he's told to and lets me bathe him regularly. He's a really good boy. \n\nI've been with my girlfriend (23f) for four months. She still lives with her parents, so naturally we spend a lot more time at my place than hers. All is good, I love spending time with her. Moose, not so much. When my girlfriend (let's call her Julia) started coming over, Moose would sit at my feet while she was around, just to be protective. If she sat next to me on the sofa, he would sit the other side. I let Moose go on the sofa and he sleeps in a dog bed in my bedroom, he doesn't get on the bed or anything. The problems started as soon as Julia started sleeping over. On the first night, Moose got into his bed when we did, and Julia shouted at him to get out of the room. I asked her why she was doing it, and she said she didn't want him there while we were sleeping. I wasn't really happy about it, firstly because she shouted and secondly, she's new to Moose and having this sort of behaviour around him could really throw him off - a new person suddenly changing his routine and shouting.\n\nHowever, I dropped it and we agreed on a compromise that I'd leave the door open so Moose could come back after she'd gone to sleep. The problems continued. I explained to her the next day that, in order to make Moose sleep somewhere else, it would take some time and he would have to learn she's not a threat. She begrudgingly agreed. \n\nNow, she started being nasty to Moose in other ways. She wants him off the sofas, which I don't agree with, especially as she doesn't live here. She has told me she's jealous of the affection I give Moose, but I feel I'm affectionate with her too. She doesn't give Moose treats ever when I ask her to, saying she doesn't want him to get bigger, and she's actually smacked him twice for bad behaviour, which I am firmly against. I've never had to smack Moose the whole time I've had him and I feel it's not her place to just do that. He was also really sad, as dogs are when they feel guilty. This just adds to the list of things she's done. I'll list them all below to summarise:\n\n1. won't give him treats when I ask.\n2. ignores him when he comes to her for love.\n3. wants him to sleep in the kitchen, despite me saying it's too cold. \n4. smacked him twice.\n5. says she's jealous of him.\n6. claims he's annoying despite having three big dogs at her parents' house that she loves.\n7. screams at him to be quiet the second he barks.\n8. feeds him half as much as I do (I don't let her feed him any more) because she thinks he's too big. \n\nSo,  WIBTA if I told her this needs to stop? I've already told her to ignore him completely if she's going to be horrible to him, but she doesn't listen. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The author is a 21-year-old guy named Alex (assuming the original poster is male) with a St Bernard named Moose. He's been with his girlfriend Julia for four months. The main issue is how Julia treats Moose, the dog.\n\nFirst, the author is clearly very attached to his dog. Moose is well-behaved and they have a close bond. Julia started staying over, and Moose acts protective by sitting near the author. When Julia first slept over, she shouted at Moose to get out of the room. The author didn't like that because shouting could stress the dog. They compromised with leaving the door open. But then Julia continued being harsh: not giving treats, smacking the dog, wanting him to sleep in the cold kitchen, etc. The author lists several grievances.\n\nThe user initially thought the author is in the wrong but is unsure. The options are A (author wrong) or B (author not wrong). \n\nI need to analyze if the author is in the wrong. Let's break down the points:\n\n1. **Dog's Behavior**: Moose is well-behaved. The protective behavior towards Julia is normal for a dog forming a bond with their owner. That's natural.\n\n2. **Julia's Actions**:\n   - Shouting at the dog: This is problematic. Shouting can stress animals and isn't a good way to correct them.\n   - Smacking the dog twice: This is abusive. The author is against physical punishment, which is correct. Smacking a dog for bad behavior isn't effective and can lead to fear or aggression.\n   - Not giving treats: The author might have asked her to, but her refusal could be a point of contention. However, if the dog is well-fed and her reasoning (weight concerns) is valid, maybe there's some justification, but the method of not giving any treats without discussion might be an issue.\n   - Ignoring the dog when it comes for affection: That could be seen as neglecting the dog's social needs, especially if the dog seeks attention.\n   - Wanting the dog to sleep in the kitchen when it's cold: This seems inconsiderate and could harm the dog's wellbeing.\n   - Jealousy towards the dog: This is a personal issue but might indicate underlying insecurities or issues in the relationship.\n   - Screaming at the dog for barking: Moose rarely barks, so this reaction is disproportionate.\n   - Feeding half the amount: The author stopped her from feeding him, which is understandable if he's concerned about the dog's health, but the author's decision to prevent her from feeding him at all might be controlling if there's no immediate health risk.\n\nThe author's main issue is Julia's treatment of the dog. He's defending Moose and is upset by her actions. The question is whether the author is wrong for being upset and considering ending things if she continues.\n\n**Arguments for the author not being in the wrong (B)**:\n- The dog is his responsibility. He's invested time and care, forming a strong bond. Julia's actions are harmful and disrespectful to his pet, which he's right to be protective about.\n- Smacking the dog is abusive, and the author is justified in opposing that.\n- The dog's well-being is a priority. Ensuring the dog is treated kindly is the owner's duty.\n- Julia's behavior shows a lack of consideration for the author's attachment and care for the dog. Her actions could indicate a pattern of being dismissive or disrespectful, which is a red flag in a relationship.\n\n**Arguments for the author being in the wrong (A)**:\n- The author might be prioritizing the dog over the relationship. If Julia is trying to adjust and the author is not accommodating, that could be a problem.\n- The author might not be communicating effectively. For example, instead of just telling Julia to ignore the dog if she's mean, he could be setting clearer boundaries or discussing his feelings more constructively.\n- The dog is his, but Julia's living situation (living with her parents) might mean she's less adaptable. The author's expectations might be unrealistic given that Julia is a new partner and not used to the dog's presence.\n\nHowever, the abusive actions (smacking) are a clear issue. The author is correct to be concerned about physical harm. Also, the dog's well-being should be a shared responsibility if Julia is visiting the house. The author has a right to expect that his pet is treated with kindness.\n\nAnother angle is the author's own behavior. He mentions that Julia is jealous, which could indicate relationship issues. The author might need to address her jealousy instead of just focusing on the dog's treatment. But if she's being abusive, that's a deal-breaker.\n\nIn conclusion, the author is not in the wrong because he's protecting his pet from mistreatment. Julia's actions are the problematic ones. The author has a right to expect that his girlfriend respects his belongings and care for his dog.\n"
