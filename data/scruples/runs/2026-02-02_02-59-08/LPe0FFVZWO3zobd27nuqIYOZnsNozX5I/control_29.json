He is my best friend, and I've lived on my own with him since I got him. He's really well behaved, rarely barks, doesn't beg for food, goes to the bathroom when he's told to and lets me bathe him regularly. He's a really good boy. \n\nI've been with my girlfriend (23f) for four months. She still lives with her parents, so naturally we spend a lot more time at my place than hers. All is good, I love spending time with her. Moose, not so much. When my girlfriend (let's call her Julia) started coming over, Moose would sit at my feet while she was around, just to be protective. If she sat next to me on the sofa, he would sit the other side. I let Moose go on the sofa and he sleeps in a dog bed in my bedroom, he doesn't get on the bed or anything. The problems started as soon as Julia started sleeping over. On the first night, Moose got into his bed when we did, and Julia shouted at him to get out of the room. I asked her why she was doing it, and she said she didn't want him there while we were sleeping. I wasn't really happy about it, firstly because she shouted and secondly, she's new to Moose and having this sort of behaviour around him could really throw him off - a new person suddenly changing his routine and shouting.\n\nHowever, I dropped it and we agreed on a compromise that I'd leave the door open so Moose could come back after she'd gone to sleep. The problems continued. I explained to her the next day that, in order to make Moose sleep somewhere else, it would take some time and he would have to learn she's not a threat. She begrudgingly agreed. \n\nNow, she started being nasty to Moose in other ways. She wants him off the sofas, which I don't agree with, especially as she doesn't live here. She has told me she's jealous of the affection I give Moose, but I feel I'm affectionate with her too. She doesn't give Moose treats ever when I ask her to, saying she doesn't want him to get bigger, and she's actually smacked him twice for bad behaviour, which I am firmly against. I've never had to smack Moose the whole time I've had him and I feel it's not her place to just do that. He was also really sad, as dogs are when they feel guilty. This just adds to the list of things she's done. I'll list them all below to summarise:\n\n1. won't give him treats when I ask.\n2. ignores him when he comes to her for love.\n3. wants him to sleep in the kitchen, despite me saying it's too cold. \n4. smacked him twice.\n5. says she's jealous of him.\n6. claims he's annoying despite having three big dogs at her parents' house that she loves.\n7. screams at him to be quiet the second he barks.\n8. feeds him half as much as I do (I don't let her feed him any more) because she thinks he's too big. \n\nSo,  WIBTA if I told her this needs to stop? I've already told her to ignore him completely if she's going to be horrible to him, but she doesn't listen. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong regarding how his girlfriend treats his dog. The author, a 21-year-old guy, has a St Bernard named Moose, they're really close. He's been with his girlfriend for four months, and she's been staying over at his place more. The main issue is how she treats Moose.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that Moose is well-behaved and they have a good relationship. When the girlfriend came over, Moose became protective, sitting next to him. She shouted at Moose not to be in the room when they sleep, which the author didn't like because shouting could stress the dog. They compromised by leaving the door open. But problems continued. The girlfriend doesn't give Moose treats, ignores him, wants him in the kitchen (cold), smacked him twice, says she's jealous, calls him annoying despite having three dogs at her parents' house, screams at him for barking, and feeds him less. The author is considering ending things if she doesn't stop.\n\nThe user wants to know if the author is in the wrong (answer A) or not (answer B). \n\nSo, from a dog care perspective, using physical punishment like smacking is generally not recommended. Positive reinforcement is the standard. The author's concern about his dog's well-being is valid. The girlfriend's actions\u2014shouting, smacking, not providing treats when asked\u2014could be harmful. The author has tried to communicate and compromise but the issues persist. \n\nThe girlfriend's jealousy is also a red flag. She's upset that the author shows affection to his dog, which is her problem. The fact that she has other dogs at her parents' house but still treats Moose poorly adds inconsistency to her behavior.\n\nThe author hasn't done anything wrong here. He's standing up for his pet's treatment. The girlfriend is the one acting in ways that are potentially harmful. So, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
