He is my best friend, and I've lived on my own with him since I got him. He's really well behaved, rarely barks, doesn't beg for food, goes to the bathroom when he's told to and lets me bathe him regularly. He's a really good boy. \n\nI've been with my girlfriend (23f) for four months. She still lives with her parents, so naturally we spend a lot more time at my place than hers. All is good, I love spending time with her. Moose, not so much. When my girlfriend (let's call her Julia) started coming over, Moose would sit at my feet while she was around, just to be protective. If she sat next to me on the sofa, he would sit the other side. I let Moose go on the sofa and he sleeps in a dog bed in my bedroom, he doesn't get on the bed or anything. The problems started as soon as Julia started sleeping over. On the first night, Moose got into his bed when we did, and Julia shouted at him to get out of the room. I asked her why she was doing it, and she said she didn't want him there while we were sleeping. I wasn't really happy about it, firstly because she shouted and secondly, she's new to Moose and having this sort of behaviour around him could really throw him off - a new person suddenly changing his routine and shouting.\n\nHowever, I dropped it and we agreed on a compromise that I'd leave the door open so Moose could come back after she'd gone to sleep. The problems continued. I explained to her the next day that, in order to make Moose sleep somewhere else, it would take some time and he would have to learn she's not a threat. She begrudgingly agreed. \n\nNow, she started being nasty to Moose in other ways. She wants him off the sofas, which I don't agree with, especially as she doesn't live here. She has told me she's jealous of the affection I give Moose, but I feel I'm affectionate with her too. She doesn't give Moose treats ever when I ask her to, saying she doesn't want him to get bigger, and she's actually smacked him twice for bad behaviour, which I am firmly against. I've never had to smack Moose the whole time I've had him and I feel it's not her place to just do that. He was also really sad, as dogs are when they feel guilty. This just adds to the list of things she's done. I'll list them all below to summarise:\n\n1. won't give him treats when I ask.\n2. ignores him when he comes to her for love.\n3. wants him to sleep in the kitchen, despite me saying it's too cold. \n4. smacked him twice.\n5. says she's jealous of him.\n6. claims he's annoying despite having three big dogs at her parents' house that she loves.\n7. screams at him to be quiet the second he barks.\n8. feeds him half as much as I do (I don't let her feed him any more) because she thinks he's too big. \n\nSo,  WIBTA if I told her this needs to stop? I've already told her to ignore him completely if she's going to be horrible to him, but she doesn't listen. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's girlfriend treating his dog poorly, and the author being upset about it.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author, 21M, has a close bond with his 3-month-old St Bernard, Moose. They live together, and Moose is well-behaved. The girlfriend, Julia, 23F, has been coming over for four months. She lives with her parents, so they spend more time at the author's place. The main issue is how Julia treats Moose.\n\nThe author lists several problems: Julia yells at Moose, wants him off the sofas, refuses to feed him treats, slapped him twice, wants him to sleep in the kitchen (cold), says she's jealous, claims he's annoying despite having big dogs she likes, screams when he barks, and feeds him less. The author argues that Moose is well-behaved and that Julia's actions are harmful.\n\nNow, the author is wondering if he's in the wrong for being upset. The user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but is unsure.\n\nI need to consider the dynamics. The author is the dog's owner. The girlfriend is a guest in his home. The owner has specific expectations for how the dog is treated. The girlfriend's actions include shouting, physical punishment, and not following the owner's rules. The owner has tried to compromise (like leaving the door open) but Julia continues. The owner is defending his dog's well-being, which is a valid concern.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, the owner has the right to set boundaries for his pet. The girlfriend's behavior could be neglectful or abusive. The author is standing up for his dog's needs, which is reasonable. The girlfriend's jealousy and actions seem to be the main issues here. The author isn't in the wrong for being upset; he's protecting his pet's welfare. The answer should be B (author not in the wrong).\n"
