He is my best friend, and I've lived on my own with him since I got him. He's really well behaved, rarely barks, doesn't beg for food, goes to the bathroom when he's told to and lets me bathe him regularly. He's a really good boy. \n\nI've been with my girlfriend (23f) for four months. She still lives with her parents, so naturally we spend a lot more time at my place than hers. All is good, I love spending time with her. Moose, not so much. When my girlfriend (let's call her Julia) started coming over, Moose would sit at my feet while she was around, just to be protective. If she sat next to me on the sofa, he would sit the other side. I let Moose go on the sofa and he sleeps in a dog bed in my bedroom, he doesn't get on the bed or anything. The problems started as soon as Julia started sleeping over. On the first night, Moose got into his bed when we did, and Julia shouted at him to get out of the room. I asked her why she was doing it, and she said she didn't want him there while we were sleeping. I wasn't really happy about it, firstly because she shouted and secondly, she's new to Moose and having this sort of behaviour around him could really throw him off - a new person suddenly changing his routine and shouting.\n\nHowever, I dropped it and we agreed on a compromise that I'd leave the door open so Moose could come back after she'd gone to sleep. The problems continued. I explained to her the next day that, in order to make Moose sleep somewhere else, it would take some time and he would have to learn she's not a threat. She begrudgingly agreed. \n\nNow, she started being nasty to Moose in other ways. She wants him off the sofas, which I don't agree with, especially as she doesn't live here. She has told me she's jealous of the affection I give Moose, but I feel I'm affectionate with her too. She doesn't give Moose treats ever when I ask her to, saying she doesn't want him to get bigger, and she's actually smacked him twice for bad behaviour, which I am firmly against. I've never had to smack Moose the whole time I've had him and I feel it's not her place to just do that. He was also really sad, as dogs are when they feel guilty. This just adds to the list of things she's done. I'll list them all below to summarise:\n\n1. won't give him treats when I ask.\n2. ignores him when he comes to her for love.\n3. wants him to sleep in the kitchen, despite me saying it's too cold. \n4. smacked him twice.\n5. says she's jealous of him.\n6. claims he's annoying despite having three big dogs at her parents' house that she loves.\n7. screams at him to be quiet the second he barks.\n8. feeds him half as much as I do (I don't let her feed him any more) because she thinks he's too big. \n\nSo,  WIBTA if I told her this needs to stop? I've already told her to ignore him completely if she's going to be horrible to him, but she doesn't listen. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being upset with his girlfriend's treatment of his dog.\n\nFirst, the author has a strong bond with his dog, Moose. The dog is well-behaved and they live together. The girlfriend, Julia, has been coming over, and there are several issues. The main points are that Julia shouts at the dog, wants him off the sofa, hits him, and doesn't follow the feeding/treat protocols the author established. The author is frustrated because he's used to Moose being well-treated, and Julia's actions are making Moose anxious.\n\nThe author isn't the one mistreating the dog. He's the owner and has made compromises, like leaving the door open so Moose can come back. He's also trying to mediate, explaining that changing Moose's routine needs time. However, Julia isn't respecting his boundaries. Her actions, like smacking the dog and not giving treats, are against how the author wants Moose treated. \n\nThe key here is that the author is concerned about his dog's well-being. Julia isn't the owner, so her authority over Moose is questionable. The author has the right to set rules for his own home and his dog's treatment. Julia's jealousy and negative behavior towards Moose are causing issues that the author is trying to address. \n\nConsidering that the author has made efforts to find compromises but Julia continues to act in ways that upset both him and Moose, it's reasonable for him to feel wronged. The author isn't being unreasonable; he's standing up for his dog's welfare. Julia's actions are the main problem here, not the author's response to them. So, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
