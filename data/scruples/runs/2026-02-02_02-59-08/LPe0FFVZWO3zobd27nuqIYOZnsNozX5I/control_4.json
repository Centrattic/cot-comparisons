He is my best friend, and I've lived on my own with him since I got him. He's really well behaved, rarely barks, doesn't beg for food, goes to the bathroom when he's told to and lets me bathe him regularly. He's a really good boy. \n\nI've been with my girlfriend (23f) for four months. She still lives with her parents, so naturally we spend a lot more time at my place than hers. All is good, I love spending time with her. Moose, not so much. When my girlfriend (let's call her Julia) started coming over, Moose would sit at my feet while she was around, just to be protective. If she sat next to me on the sofa, he would sit the other side. I let Moose go on the sofa and he sleeps in a dog bed in my bedroom, he doesn't get on the bed or anything. The problems started as soon as Julia started sleeping over. On the first night, Moose got into his bed when we did, and Julia shouted at him to get out of the room. I asked her why she was doing it, and she said she didn't want him there while we were sleeping. I wasn't really happy about it, firstly because she shouted and secondly, she's new to Moose and having this sort of behaviour around him could really throw him off - a new person suddenly changing his routine and shouting.\n\nHowever, I dropped it and we agreed on a compromise that I'd leave the door open so Moose could come back after she'd gone to sleep. The problems continued. I explained to her the next day that, in order to make Moose sleep somewhere else, it would take some time and he would have to learn she's not a threat. She begrudgingly agreed. \n\nNow, she started being nasty to Moose in other ways. She wants him off the sofas, which I don't agree with, especially as she doesn't live here. She has told me she's jealous of the affection I give Moose, but I feel I'm affectionate with her too. She doesn't give Moose treats ever when I ask her to, saying she doesn't want him to get bigger, and she's actually smacked him twice for bad behaviour, which I am firmly against. I've never had to smack Moose the whole time I've had him and I feel it's not her place to just do that. He was also really sad, as dogs are when they feel guilty. This just adds to the list of things she's done. I'll list them all below to summarise:\n\n1. won't give him treats when I ask.\n2. ignores him when he comes to her for love.\n3. wants him to sleep in the kitchen, despite me saying it's too cold. \n4. smacked him twice.\n5. says she's jealous of him.\n6. claims he's annoying despite having three big dogs at her parents' house that she loves.\n7. screams at him to be quiet the second he barks.\n8. feeds him half as much as I do (I don't let her feed him any more) because she thinks he's too big. \n\nSo,  WIBTA if I told her this needs to stop? I've already told her to ignore him completely if she's going to be horrible to him, but she doesn't listen. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being upset with how his girlfriend treats his dog.\n\nSo the situation is, the guy has a St. Bernard named Moose, who's well-behaved. They've been living together for three months. The girlfriend is new to the picture, and since they started sleeping over, she's been treating Moose poorly. The girl has done things like shouting at the dog, not giving treats, smacking him, wanting him to sleep in the kitchen, and other stuff. The author is upset because Moose is important to him, and he feels the girlfriend's actions are harmful and unnecessary.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B). Let's break down the key points.\n\nThe author has a close bond with his dog, which is normal. The girlfriend is visiting more, and Moose is protective of him, which is a natural behavior for some dogs. However, when the girlfriend started sleeping over, Moose was allowed to come in but was later excluded from the room. The girlfriend shouted at the dog, and when the author tried to compromise, she didn't follow through. Then she started other negative behaviors: not giving treats, smacking the dog, etc. The author is frustrated because he's responsible for the dog's well-being and is against physical punishment. The girlfriend's actions seem to be causing stress to the dog, and the author is defending his pet.\n\nFrom a typical Reddit AITA scenario, people often side with the person who's standing up for their pet. The girlfriend's actions towards the dog are questionable. Smacking a dog is generally not recommended, and yelling at it can be stressful. The author is the dog's owner, so he has the right to set boundaries on how others interact with his pet. The girlfriend's jealousy and actions are problematic here. The author is not in the wrong for being upset; he's protecting his dog. The girlfriend might need to adjust her behavior if she's to stay in the relationship, but the author isn't wrong for addressing the issue.\n\nSo, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
