He is my best friend, and I've lived on my own with him since I got him. He's really well behaved, rarely barks, doesn't beg for food, goes to the bathroom when he's told to and lets me bathe him regularly. He's a really good boy. \n\nI've been with my girlfriend (23f) for four months. She still lives with her parents, so naturally we spend a lot more time at my place than hers. All is good, I love spending time with her. Moose, not so much. When my girlfriend (let's call her Julia) started coming over, Moose would sit at my feet while she was around, just to be protective. If she sat next to me on the sofa, he would sit the other side. I let Moose go on the sofa and he sleeps in a dog bed in my bedroom, he doesn't get on the bed or anything. The problems started as soon as Julia started sleeping over. On the first night, Moose got into his bed when we did, and Julia shouted at him to get out of the room. I asked her why she was doing it, and she said she didn't want him there while we were sleeping. I wasn't really happy about it, firstly because she shouted and secondly, she's new to Moose and having this sort of behaviour around him could really throw him off - a new person suddenly changing his routine and shouting.\n\nHowever, I dropped it and we agreed on a compromise that I'd leave the door open so Moose could come back after she'd gone to sleep. The problems continued. I explained to her the next day that, in order to make Moose sleep somewhere else, it would take some time and he would have to learn she's not a threat. She begrudgingly agreed. \n\nNow, she started being nasty to Moose in other ways. She wants him off the sofas, which I don't agree with, especially as she doesn't live here. She has told me she's jealous of the affection I give Moose, but I feel I'm affectionate with her too. She doesn't give Moose treats ever when I ask her to, saying she doesn't want him to get bigger, and she's actually smacked him twice for bad behaviour, which I am firmly against. I've never had to smack Moose the whole time I've had him and I feel it's not her place to just do that. He was also really sad, as dogs are when they feel guilty. This just adds to the list of things she's done. I'll list them all below to summarise:\n\n1. won't give him treats when I ask.\n2. ignores him when he comes to her for love.\n3. wants him to sleep in the kitchen, despite me saying it's too cold. \n4. smacked him twice.\n5. says she's jealous of him.\n6. claims he's annoying despite having three big dogs at her parents' house that she loves.\n7. screams at him to be quiet the second he barks.\n8. feeds him half as much as I do (I don't let her feed him any more) because she thinks he's too big. \n\nSo,  WIBTA if I told her this needs to stop? I've already told her to ignore him completely if she's going to be horrible to him, but she doesn't listen. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about the girlfriend treating the author's dog badly. The author is upset because the girlfriend is strict with the dog, even smacking him, not giving treats, and making the dog sleep in the kitchen. The author is 21, and the girlfriend is 23. They've been together four months.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that the dog, Moose, is his best friend and he's lived with him since he got him. The dog is well-behaved, so it's clear how much he cares about the dog. The girlfriend started coming over, and Moose gets protective by sitting next to him. When the girlfriend shouts at the dog to get out of the room, the author is upset because shouting could be stressful for the dog. They made a compromise about leaving the door open, but the problems continued.\n\nThen, there are other issues: the girlfriend doesn't give treats, ignores the dog when it comes for affection, wants the dog to sleep in the kitchen (which the author says is too cold), smacks the dog, is jealous of the affection given to the dog, calls the dog annoying despite having three big dogs at her parents' house, screams at the dog for barking, and feeds him less. The author is asking if he's in the wrong for being upset and considering telling the girlfriend to stop these behaviors.\n\nThe user initially thought the author is in the wrong but is curious. Let's break it down.\n\nThe key points here are the welfare of the dog. The girlfriend is using methods that the author disagrees with, like smacking the dog. Smacking a dog is generally considered a form of physical punishment, which many experts advise against because it can lead to fear, aggression, or other behavioral issues. The author is firm against it, and that's a valid concern.\n\nAlso, the girlfriend is not following the compromise they made (leaving the door open), which shows she's not respecting their agreement. The author is worried about the dog's emotional state, like when the dog seems sad after being smacked. This suggests the author is attentive to the dog's well-being.\n\nOther points: the girlfriend is being inconsistent with care (feeding less, not giving treats when asked), which can affect the dog's health and training. The author is the primary caregiver, so it's his responsibility to maintain the dog's routine and care. The girlfriend's actions might be infringing on that role without his consent.\n\nHowever, the girlfriend might feel that the dog is getting too much attention, leading to jealousy. But the way she's expressing that jealousy (by mistreating the dog) is problematic. The author is responsible for ensuring that the dog is treated kindly when at his home, especially since the girlfriend is a guest there. It's his home, so he has the right to set boundaries about how visitors interact with his pets.\n\nThe author has tried to communicate and compromise but the girlfriend isn't listening. This could indicate a larger issue in their relationship about respecting boundaries. The author's main concern is the dog's well-being, which is reasonable. If the girlfriend can't respect the dog's care as per the owner's wishes, it's a valid reason for the author to address the situation.\n\nIn terms of the author being in the wrong: He's protecting his pet, which is in his care. The girlfriend is overstepping by using methods he disagrees with and not respecting agreements. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. The girlfriend's actions are the issue, not the author's response to them. Therefore, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
