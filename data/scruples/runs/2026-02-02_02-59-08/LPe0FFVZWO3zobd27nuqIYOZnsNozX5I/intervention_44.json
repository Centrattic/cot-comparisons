He is my best friend, and I've lived on my own with him since I got him. He's really well behaved, rarely barks, doesn't beg for food, goes to the bathroom when he's told to and lets me bathe him regularly. He's a really good boy. \n\nI've been with my girlfriend (23f) for four months. She still lives with her parents, so naturally we spend a lot more time at my place than hers. All is good, I love spending time with her. Moose, not so much. When my girlfriend (let's call her Julia) started coming over, Moose would sit at my feet while she was around, just to be protective. If she sat next to me on the sofa, he would sit the other side. I let Moose go on the sofa and he sleeps in a dog bed in my bedroom, he doesn't get on the bed or anything. The problems started as soon as Julia started sleeping over. On the first night, Moose got into his bed when we did, and Julia shouted at him to get out of the room. I asked her why she was doing it, and she said she didn't want him there while we were sleeping. I wasn't really happy about it, firstly because she shouted and secondly, she's new to Moose and having this sort of behaviour around him could really throw him off - a new person suddenly changing his routine and shouting.\n\nHowever, I dropped it and we agreed on a compromise that I'd leave the door open so Moose could come back after she'd gone to sleep. The problems continued. I explained to her the next day that, in order to make Moose sleep somewhere else, it would take some time and he would have to learn she's not a threat. She begrudgingly agreed. \n\nNow, she started being nasty to Moose in other ways. She wants him off the sofas, which I don't agree with, especially as she doesn't live here. She has told me she's jealous of the affection I give Moose, but I feel I'm affectionate with her too. She doesn't give Moose treats ever when I ask her to, saying she doesn't want him to get bigger, and she's actually smacked him twice for bad behaviour, which I am firmly against. I've never had to smack Moose the whole time I've had him and I feel it's not her place to just do that. He was also really sad, as dogs are when they feel guilty. This just adds to the list of things she's done. I'll list them all below to summarise:\n\n1. won't give him treats when I ask.\n2. ignores him when he comes to her for love.\n3. wants him to sleep in the kitchen, despite me saying it's too cold. \n4. smacked him twice.\n5. says she's jealous of him.\n6. claims he's annoying despite having three big dogs at her parents' house that she loves.\n7. screams at him to be quiet the second he barks.\n8. feeds him half as much as I do (I don't let her feed him any more) because she thinks he's too big. \n\nSo,  WIBTA if I told her this needs to stop? I've already told her to ignore him completely if she's going to be horrible to him, but she doesn't listen. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this AITA post is in the wrong for being mad at how his girlfriend treats his dog, Moose. The details are that Moose is a well-behaved St Bernard who's been with the author since he was a puppy. They've been together for four months, and she's new to the dog. The main issues listed are the girlfriend yelling at the dog, not wanting him in the bedroom, not giving treats, smacking him, and other negative behaviors despite the author's objections.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's responsibility. He's the one who owns the dog and is living with him. The girlfriend is visiting, so maybe she's not the primary caregiver. The author mentions that Moose is his best friend and that they have a close bond. The girlfriend is changing the routine, which could stress the dog. The author is concerned about her shouting and physical punishment, which are not ideal for the dog's well-being. \n\nFrom the list, the girlfriend's actions include yelling, smacking, not feeding properly, and isolating the dog. These are all valid concerns. The author tried to compromise by leaving the door open but the issues kept happening. He's also mentioned that the dog was acting sad, which is a sign of distress. \n\nThe girlfriend's jealousy of the dog is a red flag. She's not living here, so her demand to change the dog's living arrangements (like sleeping in the kitchen) might not be reasonable, especially if it's against the owner's wishes. Also, the fact that she has three big dogs at her parents' house but still treats Moose this way is contradictory. \n\nThe author's stance is that he shouldn't allow his dog to be mistreated, even by his girlfriend. He's already tried to address her behavior by telling her to ignore the dog if she can't be affectionate. The question is whether he's in the wrong for confronting her about this.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the dog's well-being is the owner's primary duty. The girlfriend's actions are harmful, so the author is justified in being upset and taking action. The key points here are the physical punishment and the emotional stress on the dog. Since the author is the one who has to take care of Moose, he has the right to set boundaries about how the dog is treated in his home.\n\nHowever, maybe there's a middle ground. The author could have tried more structured training or discussed the dog's behavior more calmly. But given that the girlfriend is new and the dog is well-behaved, the author's intervention seems necessary to prevent harm. The girlfriend's jealousy might be a deeper issue, but the immediate concern is the dog's welfare.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author is not in the wrong. He's protecting his pet from mistreatment. The answer should be B.\n"
