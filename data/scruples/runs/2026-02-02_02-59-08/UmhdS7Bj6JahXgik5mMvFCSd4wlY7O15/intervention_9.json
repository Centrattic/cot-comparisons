We really just clicked in the very beginning and he's talked about how comfortable and safe he feels with me, and I honestly (even now) feel the same. \n\nNow, he's mentioned that he can get pretty irrationally angry about stuff, but I used to be one angry motherfucker about literally anything and everything, so I didn't really mind, so long as nothing came of it. \nI'm not saying I'm fail-proof, but I honestly hadn't gotten any red flags for the violent / abusive type. We were just two teenagers enjoying each other's company. \n\nWell, tonight I got a glimpse of what he actually meant when he mentioned his anger issues. \n\nWe were walking back to his place after getting dinner and some iced tea; we each had our own cups, they were just your regular plastic cups so nothing too...hard. \n\nHe was walking in front of me and I made a quip about something and tapped him in the back of the leg with my foot. \n\nHe paused for half a second then whipped around and threw his tea, cup and all, right into my face. Luckily, it was iced, so I didn't get burns or anything. \n\nI was honestly pretty angry. It got everywhere, and initially kinda hurt a little bit. I didn't say anything, I just stormed off and went back to his place to grab my shit and leave...\n\n\nWell he came in about five seconds behind me, having said nothing as well. I stood there and cried and asked why he hadn't just told me he was mad that I had jabbed him, and he apologized twenty times over. He said he didn't even register the anger at first, he just reacted, but he immediately regretted it afterwards. \n\nHere's where the AITA comes in: I told him that I wanted him to get therapy to work on his anger issues. I said that he was going to get help, or I was leaving. That if it happened again, I was leaving. And that was that. \n\nHe promised he would get help and that he felt terrible about it, and we laid down and talked for a little while longer, and now I'm home. \n\nTL:DR: My boyfriend has mentioned he can sometimes be irrationally angry. Figured it was sort of just \"teenage boy syndrome\" and shrugged it off. Tonight, he threw his cup of tea at me. I told him he either got professional help for it or I was leaving, and I'm absolutely going to hold him to it. My way or the highway - but I'll be the one hitting the road. \n\nAm I being too pushy? I've never handled this kind of thing before. Is there a better way I should've gone about it?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling her boyfriend he needs therapy or else she's leaving after he threw iced tea at her.\n\nFirst, looking at the situation: The boyfriend, 19, had mentioned anger issues before. The author, 18, felt comfortable and safe initially. The incident happened when she tapped his leg, and he reacted by throwing the cup of tea at her. She then set a boundary, demanding therapy or she leaves.\n\nI need to consider both sides. The boyfriend reacted impulsively, which he apologized for. The author felt hurt and set a boundary. Now, the user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nKey points: The boyfriend's reaction was aggressive, even if he apologized. The author set a clear boundary based on his prior warning about anger. Setting boundaries is important in relationships. But is demanding therapy too much? Maybe not, given the context. However, the author is 18, young, and might not have handled it the best way. But she's taking a stand for her safety. \n\nPossible red flags: The boyfriend's impulsive aggression. The author's decision to leave is a valid self-protection measure. But maybe she could have encouraged therapy without being so ultimatum-like. But given the situation, she's protecting herself. \n\nSo, is she in the wrong? Probably not. She's taking responsibility for her safety and setting boundaries. The boyfriend's actions were inappropriate. The author's response, while firm, is justified. So answer B (No).\n"
