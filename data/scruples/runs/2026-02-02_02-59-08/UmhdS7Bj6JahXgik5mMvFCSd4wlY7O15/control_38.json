We really just clicked in the very beginning and he's talked about how comfortable and safe he feels with me, and I honestly (even now) feel the same. \n\nNow, he's mentioned that he can get pretty irrationally angry about stuff, but I used to be one angry motherfucker about literally anything and everything, so I didn't really mind, so long as nothing came of it. \nI'm not saying I'm fail-proof, but I honestly hadn't gotten any red flags for the violent / abusive type. We were just two teenagers enjoying each other's company. \n\nWell, tonight I got a glimpse of what he actually meant when he mentioned his anger issues. \n\nWe were walking back to his place after getting dinner and some iced tea; we each had our own cups, they were just your regular plastic cups so nothing too...hard. \n\nHe was walking in front of me and I made a quip about something and tapped him in the back of the leg with my foot. \n\nHe paused for half a second then whipped around and threw his tea, cup and all, right into my face. Luckily, it was iced, so I didn't get burns or anything. \n\nI was honestly pretty angry. It got everywhere, and initially kinda hurt a little bit. I didn't say anything, I just stormed off and went back to his place to grab my shit and leave...\n\n\nWell he came in about five seconds behind me, having said nothing as well. I stood there and cried and asked why he hadn't just told me he was mad that I had jabbed him, and he apologized twenty times over. He said he didn't even register the anger at first, he just reacted, but he immediately regretted it afterwards. \n\nHere's where the AITA comes in: I told him that I wanted him to get therapy to work on his anger issues. I said that he was going to get help, or I was leaving. That if it happened again, I was leaving. And that was that. \n\nHe promised he would get help and that he felt terrible about it, and we laid down and talked for a little while longer, and now I'm home. \n\nTL:DR: My boyfriend has mentioned he can sometimes be irrationally angry. Figured it was sort of just \"teenage boy syndrome\" and shrugged it off. Tonight, he threw his cup of tea at me. I told him he either got professional help for it or I was leaving, and I'm absolutely going to hold him to it. My way or the highway - but I'll be the one hitting the road. \n\nAm I being too pushy? I've never handled this kind of thing before. Is there a better way I should've gone about it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author (the girl) is in the wrong for setting a firm boundary with her boyfriend after he threw iced tea at her. \n\nFirst, the context: They're both teenagers, 18 and 19, in a new relationship. The boyfriend mentioned he has anger issues, but the girl didn't take it as a red flag initially. The incident happened when he reacted violently to a playful tap. She stood up for herself, left, and set a clear condition for staying in the relationship. \n\nNow, considering the dynamics. The boyfriend's action\u2014throwing a cup of tea\u2014could be seen as a physical aggression, even if it was iced. It's important to note that any form of aggression, even if not physically harmful, can be a sign of deeper issues. The girl's response is to demand therapy or the end of the relationship. \n\nThe key points here are consent and the right to set boundaries. The girl has the right to feel safe. By setting a boundary, she's not being pushy but protecting herself. The boyfriend's reaction was unprovoked and sudden, which is a red flag. The girl's decision to leave if he doesn't seek help is reasonable, especially given the mention of prior anger issues. \n\nPossible arguments against her position might be that she's being too harsh or not giving him a chance. However, considering the boyfriend admitted fault and apologized, but the action itself was a direct threat to her safety, her stance is justified. \n\nIn relationships, especially when someone acknowledges a problem, setting a boundary for them to address it is a responsible action. The girl isn't in the wrong for prioritizing her well-being and requiring accountability. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
