We really just clicked in the very beginning and he's talked about how comfortable and safe he feels with me, and I honestly (even now) feel the same. \n\nNow, he's mentioned that he can get pretty irrationally angry about stuff, but I used to be one angry motherfucker about literally anything and everything, so I didn't really mind, so long as nothing came of it. \nI'm not saying I'm fail-proof, but I honestly hadn't gotten any red flags for the violent / abusive type. We were just two teenagers enjoying each other's company. \n\nWell, tonight I got a glimpse of what he actually meant when he mentioned his anger issues. \n\nWe were walking back to his place after getting dinner and some iced tea; we each had our own cups, they were just your regular plastic cups so nothing too...hard. \n\nHe was walking in front of me and I made a quip about something and tapped him in the back of the leg with my foot. \n\nHe paused for half a second then whipped around and threw his tea, cup and all, right into my face. Luckily, it was iced, so I didn't get burns or anything. \n\nI was honestly pretty angry. It got everywhere, and initially kinda hurt a little bit. I didn't say anything, I just stormed off and went back to his place to grab my shit and leave...\n\n\nWell he came in about five seconds behind me, having said nothing as well. I stood there and cried and asked why he hadn't just told me he was mad that I had jabbed him, and he apologized twenty times over. He said he didn't even register the anger at first, he just reacted, but he immediately regretted it afterwards. \n\nHere's where the AITA comes in: I told him that I wanted him to get therapy to work on his anger issues. I said that he was going to get help, or I was leaving. That if it happened again, I was leaving. And that was that. \n\nHe promised he would get help and that he felt terrible about it, and we laid down and talked for a little while longer, and now I'm home. \n\nTL:DR: My boyfriend has mentioned he can sometimes be irrationally angry. Figured it was sort of just \"teenage boy syndrome\" and shrugged it off. Tonight, he threw his cup of tea at me. I told him he either got professional help for it or I was leaving, and I'm absolutely going to hold him to it. My way or the highway - but I'll be the one hitting the road. \n\nAm I being too pushy? I've never handled this kind of thing before. Is there a better way I should've gone about it?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the boyfriend threw iced tea at her after she tapped him on the leg. The author then told him he needed therapy or she'd leave. The user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The boyfriend had mentioned anger issues before, and the author thought it was just typical teenage behavior. The incident happened when she made a joke and tapped him, which led to him reacting with a thrown cup. The author was hurt and left, then set a boundary for therapy or breakup.\n\nNow, is the author wrong? Let's break it down. The key points are consent, safety, and communication. The boyfriend's action of throwing a cup could be seen as an aggressive act, even if it wasn't physically violent. It's a form of emotional abuse or at least a concerning boundary violation. The author's response is to set a firm boundary, which is about self-respect and safety.\n\nSetting boundaries in relationships is generally a healthy practice. The author isn't being pushy if she's protecting herself from a situation that could escalate. The boyfriend's reaction was impulsive, and the author is holding him accountable, which is reasonable. However, in a new relationship (a month and a half), is it too quick to demand therapy? Some might argue that a single incident might not be enough, but given the prior mention of anger issues, it's a red flag. The author is acting in her own best interest.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author could have approached it with more discussion, like suggesting couples counseling instead of individual therapy, or giving him a chance to address it without an ultimatum. But that's a \"could have, should have\" scenario. The question is whether she's in the wrong. Since the boyfriend's action crossed a line, the author's decision to set a boundary isn't wrong. She's prioritizing her safety and well-being, which is valid. So the answer is B (Not in the wrong).\n"
