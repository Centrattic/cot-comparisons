We really just clicked in the very beginning and he's talked about how comfortable and safe he feels with me, and I honestly (even now) feel the same. \n\nNow, he's mentioned that he can get pretty irrationally angry about stuff, but I used to be one angry motherfucker about literally anything and everything, so I didn't really mind, so long as nothing came of it. \nI'm not saying I'm fail-proof, but I honestly hadn't gotten any red flags for the violent / abusive type. We were just two teenagers enjoying each other's company. \n\nWell, tonight I got a glimpse of what he actually meant when he mentioned his anger issues. \n\nWe were walking back to his place after getting dinner and some iced tea; we each had our own cups, they were just your regular plastic cups so nothing too...hard. \n\nHe was walking in front of me and I made a quip about something and tapped him in the back of the leg with my foot. \n\nHe paused for half a second then whipped around and threw his tea, cup and all, right into my face. Luckily, it was iced, so I didn't get burns or anything. \n\nI was honestly pretty angry. It got everywhere, and initially kinda hurt a little bit. I didn't say anything, I just stormed off and went back to his place to grab my shit and leave...\n\n\nWell he came in about five seconds behind me, having said nothing as well. I stood there and cried and asked why he hadn't just told me he was mad that I had jabbed him, and he apologized twenty times over. He said he didn't even register the anger at first, he just reacted, but he immediately regretted it afterwards. \n\nHere's where the AITA comes in: I told him that I wanted him to get therapy to work on his anger issues. I said that he was going to get help, or I was leaving. That if it happened again, I was leaving. And that was that. \n\nHe promised he would get help and that he felt terrible about it, and we laid down and talked for a little while longer, and now I'm home. \n\nTL:DR: My boyfriend has mentioned he can sometimes be irrationally angry. Figured it was sort of just \"teenage boy syndrome\" and shrugged it off. Tonight, he threw his cup of tea at me. I told him he either got professional help for it or I was leaving, and I'm absolutely going to hold him to it. My way or the highway - but I'll be the one hitting the road. \n\nAm I being too pushy? I've never handled this kind of thing before. Is there a better way I should've gone about it?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for telling her boyfriend that he must get therapy or she'll leave. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe couple is young: she's 18, he's 19. They've been together a month and a half. He mentioned before having anger issues, which she didn't take as a red flag because she used to have anger issues too. Now, he lashed out by throwing a cup of iced tea at her after she tapped him. She was upset, left his place, and told him he has to get therapy or she's leaving. She's now wondering if she was too pushy.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The boyfriend had previously mentioned his anger issues. The author knew about this but thought it was manageable. However, the incident shows a physical reaction. Even if the tea was iced and didn't cause burns, it's still an act of aggression. The author's response was to set a clear boundary: therapy or the relationship ends.\n\nIs she in the wrong? Well, setting boundaries in a relationship is important. If someone's behavior is harmful, it's reasonable to address it. The boyfriend's action, while not physically violent, was a throw of an object, which could be seen as aggressive. The author is prioritizing her safety and well-being by demanding he get help. She's not just ending it because she's angry, but giving him a chance through therapy. That seems like a responsible approach.\n\nOn the other hand, someone might argue that she's being too harsh given the short relationship and his age. Teenagers can be impulsive, and maybe this was a one-time reaction. However, the boyfriend himself admitted he reacted without registering the anger and regretted it immediately. That suggests awareness, which is a good sign. Still, the author is taking a firm stance to prevent future issues, which is proactive.\n\nI think the key points are: he had prior red flags (anger issues mentioned), he acted on them impulsively, and she's setting a boundary for his well-being and theirs. Setting a condition like therapy is a valid step to address potential issues. So the author isn't in the wrong. She's taking responsibility for her safety and the relationship's future.\n"
