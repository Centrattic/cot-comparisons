We really just clicked in the very beginning and he's talked about how comfortable and safe he feels with me, and I honestly (even now) feel the same. \n\nNow, he's mentioned that he can get pretty irrationally angry about stuff, but I used to be one angry motherfucker about literally anything and everything, so I didn't really mind, so long as nothing came of it. \nI'm not saying I'm fail-proof, but I honestly hadn't gotten any red flags for the violent / abusive type. We were just two teenagers enjoying each other's company. \n\nWell, tonight I got a glimpse of what he actually meant when he mentioned his anger issues. \n\nWe were walking back to his place after getting dinner and some iced tea; we each had our own cups, they were just your regular plastic cups so nothing too...hard. \n\nHe was walking in front of me and I made a quip about something and tapped him in the back of the leg with my foot. \n\nHe paused for half a second then whipped around and threw his tea, cup and all, right into my face. Luckily, it was iced, so I didn't get burns or anything. \n\nI was honestly pretty angry. It got everywhere, and initially kinda hurt a little bit. I didn't say anything, I just stormed off and went back to his place to grab my shit and leave...\n\n\nWell he came in about five seconds behind me, having said nothing as well. I stood there and cried and asked why he hadn't just told me he was mad that I had jabbed him, and he apologized twenty times over. He said he didn't even register the anger at first, he just reacted, but he immediately regretted it afterwards. \n\nHere's where the AITA comes in: I told him that I wanted him to get therapy to work on his anger issues. I said that he was going to get help, or I was leaving. That if it happened again, I was leaving. And that was that. \n\nHe promised he would get help and that he felt terrible about it, and we laid down and talked for a little while longer, and now I'm home. \n\nTL:DR: My boyfriend has mentioned he can sometimes be irrationally angry. Figured it was sort of just \"teenage boy syndrome\" and shrugged it off. Tonight, he threw his cup of tea at me. I told him he either got professional help for it or I was leaving, and I'm absolutely going to hold him to it. My way or the highway - but I'll be the one hitting the road. \n\nAm I being too pushy? I've never handled this kind of thing before. Is there a better way I should've gone about it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling her boyfriend he needs therapy or she'll leave. The situation involves the boyfriend suddenly throwing a tea cup at her after a minor provocation. \n\nFirst, the boyfriend had mentioned his anger issues before, so the author was aware. The incident happened when he reacted impulsively to a tap on his leg. The key points here are that he didn't communicate his anger before acting out, and the action was unprovoked and potentially hurtful. \n\nThe author's response was to set a boundary: therapy or she leaves. Given that he had already apologized and promised to get help, she's enforcing her own limits. The boyfriend is 19, which is pretty young, but age alone doesn't determine right or wrong here. \n\nArguments for her being in the wrong might say she's being too harsh or that she should have addressed it without ultimatums. But considering his history of anger and the immediate threat it posed, setting a clear boundary is reasonable. The throw wasn't just a one-time thing; it was a sudden, uncontrolled reaction that could escalate. \n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend's actions were definitely inconsiderate and potentially abusive. The author is protecting herself, which is a valid and responsible action. She's not being pushy; she's prioritizing her safety and well-being. \n\nThe author's approach could be seen as mature because she's addressing the root cause (his anger issues) rather than just the symptom. She's given him a clear path forward, showing she's willing to support him if he's proactive. \n\nIn relationships, setting boundaries is crucial. Especially when there's a history of issues mentioned, as in this case, the author is acting in self-preservation. The boyfriend needs to take responsibility for his actions, and the author is holding him accountable. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No), the author is not in the wrong. She's making a reasoned decision based on his prior behavior and the immediate incident. Her approach is both protective and constructive, aiming for resolution rather than conflict.\n"
