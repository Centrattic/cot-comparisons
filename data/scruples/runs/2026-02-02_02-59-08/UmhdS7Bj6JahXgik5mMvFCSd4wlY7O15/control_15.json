We really just clicked in the very beginning and he's talked about how comfortable and safe he feels with me, and I honestly (even now) feel the same. \n\nNow, he's mentioned that he can get pretty irrationally angry about stuff, but I used to be one angry motherfucker about literally anything and everything, so I didn't really mind, so long as nothing came of it. \nI'm not saying I'm fail-proof, but I honestly hadn't gotten any red flags for the violent / abusive type. We were just two teenagers enjoying each other's company. \n\nWell, tonight I got a glimpse of what he actually meant when he mentioned his anger issues. \n\nWe were walking back to his place after getting dinner and some iced tea; we each had our own cups, they were just your regular plastic cups so nothing too...hard. \n\nHe was walking in front of me and I made a quip about something and tapped him in the back of the leg with my foot. \n\nHe paused for half a second then whipped around and threw his tea, cup and all, right into my face. Luckily, it was iced, so I didn't get burns or anything. \n\nI was honestly pretty angry. It got everywhere, and initially kinda hurt a little bit. I didn't say anything, I just stormed off and went back to his place to grab my shit and leave...\n\n\nWell he came in about five seconds behind me, having said nothing as well. I stood there and cried and asked why he hadn't just told me he was mad that I had jabbed him, and he apologized twenty times over. He said he didn't even register the anger at first, he just reacted, but he immediately regretted it afterwards. \n\nHere's where the AITA comes in: I told him that I wanted him to get therapy to work on his anger issues. I said that he was going to get help, or I was leaving. That if it happened again, I was leaving. And that was that. \n\nHe promised he would get help and that he felt terrible about it, and we laid down and talked for a little while longer, and now I'm home. \n\nTL:DR: My boyfriend has mentioned he can sometimes be irrationally angry. Figured it was sort of just \"teenage boy syndrome\" and shrugged it off. Tonight, he threw his cup of tea at me. I told him he either got professional help for it or I was leaving, and I'm absolutely going to hold him to it. My way or the highway - but I'll be the one hitting the road. \n\nAm I being too pushy? I've never handled this kind of thing before. Is there a better way I should've gone about it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the girl in the story) is in the wrong after telling her boyfriend he needs therapy or she'll leave. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend is 19, the author is 18. They've been together a month and a half. He mentioned he has anger issues, and she used to have similar issues but didn't mind. Now, he reacted by throwing a cup of tea at her after a playful tap on the leg. She felt hurt, left, and then set a boundary that he must get therapy or she's leaving.\n\nThe key points here are her response to his action. She's setting a boundary based on his own admission of anger problems. She didn't just confront him with an ultimatum out of nowhere; she had prior knowledge of his issues. The incident was a direct example of what he warned her about. She's insisting on professional help, which is a reasonable step to address potential future issues. \n\nNow, considering whether she's wrong. Setting clear boundaries in a relationship, especially about safety and well-being, is generally seen as responsible. The boyfriend's action, while not physically violent, was an act of aggression. The author is taking a proactive stance to prevent escalation. \n\nSome might argue that she's being too harsh, especially since it was a first-time incident and he apologized. But others would say that acknowledging the risk of his anger and seeking help is crucial. Therapy is a common and recommended step for managing anger. Her approach is firm but not unreasonable. \n\nI should also consider the context of their relationship being new. She's not jumping to conclusions but acting on the information he provided. She's not accusing him of abuse but addressing a known issue he himself mentioned. \n\nSo, the author is not in the wrong. She's protecting herself and addressing a problem that he acknowledged he has. The answer is B.\n"
