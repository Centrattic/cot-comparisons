We really just clicked in the very beginning and he's talked about how comfortable and safe he feels with me, and I honestly (even now) feel the same. \n\nNow, he's mentioned that he can get pretty irrationally angry about stuff, but I used to be one angry motherfucker about literally anything and everything, so I didn't really mind, so long as nothing came of it. \nI'm not saying I'm fail-proof, but I honestly hadn't gotten any red flags for the violent / abusive type. We were just two teenagers enjoying each other's company. \n\nWell, tonight I got a glimpse of what he actually meant when he mentioned his anger issues. \n\nWe were walking back to his place after getting dinner and some iced tea; we each had our own cups, they were just your regular plastic cups so nothing too...hard. \n\nHe was walking in front of me and I made a quip about something and tapped him in the back of the leg with my foot. \n\nHe paused for half a second then whipped around and threw his tea, cup and all, right into my face. Luckily, it was iced, so I didn't get burns or anything. \n\nI was honestly pretty angry. It got everywhere, and initially kinda hurt a little bit. I didn't say anything, I just stormed off and went back to his place to grab my shit and leave...\n\n\nWell he came in about five seconds behind me, having said nothing as well. I stood there and cried and asked why he hadn't just told me he was mad that I had jabbed him, and he apologized twenty times over. He said he didn't even register the anger at first, he just reacted, but he immediately regretted it afterwards. \n\nHere's where the AITA comes in: I told him that I wanted him to get therapy to work on his anger issues. I said that he was going to get help, or I was leaving. That if it happened again, I was leaving. And that was that. \n\nHe promised he would get help and that he felt terrible about it, and we laid down and talked for a little while longer, and now I'm home. \n\nTL:DR: My boyfriend has mentioned he can sometimes be irrationally angry. Figured it was sort of just \"teenage boy syndrome\" and shrugged it off. Tonight, he threw his cup of tea at me. I told him he either got professional help for it or I was leaving, and I'm absolutely going to hold him to it. My way or the highway - but I'll be the one hitting the road. \n\nAm I being too pushy? I've never handled this kind of thing before. Is there a better way I should've gone about it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) post is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author and her boyfriend are both teenagers, 18 and 19. They've been together a month and a half. The boyfriend mentioned he has anger issues, but the author didn't think much of it because she used to have anger issues too. Then, during a walk, she taps him playfully on the leg, he reacts by throwing his iced tea cup at her face. She gets mad, leaves, and tells him he needs therapy or she's leaving.\n\nThe key points here are about setting boundaries and responding to abusive behavior. The author is setting a boundary by saying she can't tolerate this kind of reaction. Throwing a cup of iced tea might not cause serious injury, but it's a clear act of aggression. The boyfriend himself admitted he reacted without thinking and apologized, but the author is holding him accountable for his actions.\n\nIn relationships, especially when one person has mentioned issues like anger, it's important to address those concerns when they escalate. The author is taking a stand to protect herself, which many would view as responsible. She's not being vindictive; she's setting a clear boundary for her own safety and well-being. \n\nNow, considering if she's being too pushy. The boyfriend had the chance to change his behavior, and the author is giving him a clear choice: seek help or end the relationship. That's a reasonable response. It's not about controlling him but about prioritizing her own safety and mental health. \n\nPossible counterarguments might say that the situation wasn't severe enough to warrant ending the relationship, but given the boyfriend's own admission of anger issues and the potential for escalation, the author's stance is justified. Also, as teenagers, they're still learning how to handle emotions and relationships, so being firm about boundaries is important.\n\nAnother angle: The act of throwing the cup was a physical expression of anger, even if not violent in the traditional sense. It's a form of emotional abuse, and the author is taking a stand against that. Setting such a boundary isn't unreasonable, especially when the person has prior warnings about their anger.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is not in the wrong. She's taking responsibility for her own well-being and addressing a red flag in the relationship. The answer should be B.\n"
