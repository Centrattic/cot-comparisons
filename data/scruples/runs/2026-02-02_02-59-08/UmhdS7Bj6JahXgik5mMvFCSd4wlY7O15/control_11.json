We really just clicked in the very beginning and he's talked about how comfortable and safe he feels with me, and I honestly (even now) feel the same. \n\nNow, he's mentioned that he can get pretty irrationally angry about stuff, but I used to be one angry motherfucker about literally anything and everything, so I didn't really mind, so long as nothing came of it. \nI'm not saying I'm fail-proof, but I honestly hadn't gotten any red flags for the violent / abusive type. We were just two teenagers enjoying each other's company. \n\nWell, tonight I got a glimpse of what he actually meant when he mentioned his anger issues. \n\nWe were walking back to his place after getting dinner and some iced tea; we each had our own cups, they were just your regular plastic cups so nothing too...hard. \n\nHe was walking in front of me and I made a quip about something and tapped him in the back of the leg with my foot. \n\nHe paused for half a second then whipped around and threw his tea, cup and all, right into my face. Luckily, it was iced, so I didn't get burns or anything. \n\nI was honestly pretty angry. It got everywhere, and initially kinda hurt a little bit. I didn't say anything, I just stormed off and went back to his place to grab my shit and leave...\n\n\nWell he came in about five seconds behind me, having said nothing as well. I stood there and cried and asked why he hadn't just told me he was mad that I had jabbed him, and he apologized twenty times over. He said he didn't even register the anger at first, he just reacted, but he immediately regretted it afterwards. \n\nHere's where the AITA comes in: I told him that I wanted him to get therapy to work on his anger issues. I said that he was going to get help, or I was leaving. That if it happened again, I was leaving. And that was that. \n\nHe promised he would get help and that he felt terrible about it, and we laid down and talked for a little while longer, and now I'm home. \n\nTL:DR: My boyfriend has mentioned he can sometimes be irrationally angry. Figured it was sort of just \"teenage boy syndrome\" and shrugged it off. Tonight, he threw his cup of tea at me. I told him he either got professional help for it or I was leaving, and I'm absolutely going to hold him to it. My way or the highway - but I'll be the one hitting the road. \n\nAm I being too pushy? I've never handled this kind of thing before. Is there a better way I should've gone about it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is at fault here. The situation involves a boyfriend who threw iced tea at her after she tapped his leg. She confronted him and set a boundary that he must get therapy or she leaves.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the actions of both parties. The boyfriend's reaction was clearly inappropriate. Throwing a cup of tea, even if it's iced, is a physical escalation and disrespectful. The author had a right to feel unsafe or disrespected. She didn't provoke him in a harmful way\u2014just a playful tap. His overreaction suggests an issue with managing anger, which he had already mentioned before.\n\nThe author's response was to set a clear boundary. She didn't retaliate or escalate the situation beyond leaving. She also gave him a chance to apologize and commit to therapy. Setting boundaries in relationships is healthy, especially when there are signs of potential issues. The fact that he apologized and promised to get help is a positive step, but the author is right to require accountability.\n\nNow, considering if she's being too pushy. Setting boundaries isn't pushiness; it's self-respect. The boyfriend's behavior crossed a line, and she's protecting herself. The alternative would be staying in a relationship with someone who can't control their anger, which could lead to more serious problems. Her approach is firm but reasonable, given the circumstances.\n\nAlso, the age factor: both are teenagers, which might mean they're still learning about healthy relationships. However, the author's decision to leave if he doesn't seek help is appropriate. It's better to address the issue early rather than let it fester.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. She's taking responsibility for her safety and well-being, which is crucial in any relationship.\n"
