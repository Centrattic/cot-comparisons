We really just clicked in the very beginning and he's talked about how comfortable and safe he feels with me, and I honestly (even now) feel the same. \n\nNow, he's mentioned that he can get pretty irrationally angry about stuff, but I used to be one angry motherfucker about literally anything and everything, so I didn't really mind, so long as nothing came of it. \nI'm not saying I'm fail-proof, but I honestly hadn't gotten any red flags for the violent / abusive type. We were just two teenagers enjoying each other's company. \n\nWell, tonight I got a glimpse of what he actually meant when he mentioned his anger issues. \n\nWe were walking back to his place after getting dinner and some iced tea; we each had our own cups, they were just your regular plastic cups so nothing too...hard. \n\nHe was walking in front of me and I made a quip about something and tapped him in the back of the leg with my foot. \n\nHe paused for half a second then whipped around and threw his tea, cup and all, right into my face. Luckily, it was iced, so I didn't get burns or anything. \n\nI was honestly pretty angry. It got everywhere, and initially kinda hurt a little bit. I didn't say anything, I just stormed off and went back to his place to grab my shit and leave...\n\n\nWell he came in about five seconds behind me, having said nothing as well. I stood there and cried and asked why he hadn't just told me he was mad that I had jabbed him, and he apologized twenty times over. He said he didn't even register the anger at first, he just reacted, but he immediately regretted it afterwards. \n\nHere's where the AITA comes in: I told him that I wanted him to get therapy to work on his anger issues. I said that he was going to get help, or I was leaving. That if it happened again, I was leaving. And that was that. \n\nHe promised he would get help and that he felt terrible about it, and we laid down and talked for a little while longer, and now I'm home. \n\nTL:DR: My boyfriend has mentioned he can sometimes be irrationally angry. Figured it was sort of just \"teenage boy syndrome\" and shrugged it off. Tonight, he threw his cup of tea at me. I told him he either got professional help for it or I was leaving, and I'm absolutely going to hold him to it. My way or the highway - but I'll be the one hitting the road. \n\nAm I being too pushy? I've never handled this kind of thing before. Is there a better way I should've gone about it?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe user is a woman in a relationship with a 19-year-old boyfriend for about a month and a half. They both felt comfortable and safe. She mentions that he had talked about having irrational anger issues, but she didn't take it as a red flag because she used to be angry too. \n\nThe incident happened when they were walking back from dinner. She tapped him on the leg, and he reacted by throwing his iced tea cup at her face. She was upset, left, and then told him he either gets therapy or she's leaving. He apologized and agreed to get help. The question is whether she was in the wrong for setting that boundary.\n\nFirst, I should consider the context of the situation. The boyfriend had mentioned his anger issues before, so the author was aware. When the incident occurred, he reacted impulsively without realizing it at first. The author set a boundary by requiring therapy or leaving. \n\nIs setting such a boundary too pushy? Well, setting boundaries in relationships is generally healthy. If someone is aware of a potential issue (like anger management) and a partner has a harmful reaction (throwing a cup), it's reasonable to address it. Therapy is a common and constructive way to handle such issues. \n\nHowever, some might argue that the situation was a one-time incident and that she overreacted. But given that he had mentioned the problem before, and she's trying to prevent future incidents, her action seems proactive. Also, considering the emotional impact of having something thrown in the face, even if it's iced tea, it's understandable that she felt unsafe and needed to take a firm stance.\n\nAnother angle: the relationship is new, only a month and a half. Some might say she's being too quick to set such a strict boundary. But others would say that addressing red flags early is wise. Since he had already mentioned his issues, she had prior knowledge, so her decision is based on that.\n\nIn terms of communication, she didn't confront him during the incident but after. She allowed him to apologize and then set the condition. He agreed to get help. So, it seems like they had a constructive conversation. \n\nPossible counterarguments: Maybe she should have given him more time or tried other methods first. But she's in a new relationship and might not have experience with this. Also, the act of throwing the cup is a clear sign of a problematic reaction, so pushing for therapy is a reasonable step.\n\nI think the key here is that she's setting a boundary based on prior knowledge and a specific incident. It's not about being pushy but about her own safety and the health of the relationship. Therefore, she's not in the wrong.\n"
