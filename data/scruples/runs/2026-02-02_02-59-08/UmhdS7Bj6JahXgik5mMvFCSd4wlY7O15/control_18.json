We really just clicked in the very beginning and he's talked about how comfortable and safe he feels with me, and I honestly (even now) feel the same. \n\nNow, he's mentioned that he can get pretty irrationally angry about stuff, but I used to be one angry motherfucker about literally anything and everything, so I didn't really mind, so long as nothing came of it. \nI'm not saying I'm fail-proof, but I honestly hadn't gotten any red flags for the violent / abusive type. We were just two teenagers enjoying each other's company. \n\nWell, tonight I got a glimpse of what he actually meant when he mentioned his anger issues. \n\nWe were walking back to his place after getting dinner and some iced tea; we each had our own cups, they were just your regular plastic cups so nothing too...hard. \n\nHe was walking in front of me and I made a quip about something and tapped him in the back of the leg with my foot. \n\nHe paused for half a second then whipped around and threw his tea, cup and all, right into my face. Luckily, it was iced, so I didn't get burns or anything. \n\nI was honestly pretty angry. It got everywhere, and initially kinda hurt a little bit. I didn't say anything, I just stormed off and went back to his place to grab my shit and leave...\n\n\nWell he came in about five seconds behind me, having said nothing as well. I stood there and cried and asked why he hadn't just told me he was mad that I had jabbed him, and he apologized twenty times over. He said he didn't even register the anger at first, he just reacted, but he immediately regretted it afterwards. \n\nHere's where the AITA comes in: I told him that I wanted him to get therapy to work on his anger issues. I said that he was going to get help, or I was leaving. That if it happened again, I was leaving. And that was that. \n\nHe promised he would get help and that he felt terrible about it, and we laid down and talked for a little while longer, and now I'm home. \n\nTL:DR: My boyfriend has mentioned he can sometimes be irrationally angry. Figured it was sort of just \"teenage boy syndrome\" and shrugged it off. Tonight, he threw his cup of tea at me. I told him he either got professional help for it or I was leaving, and I'm absolutely going to hold him to it. My way or the highway - but I'll be the one hitting the road. \n\nAm I being too pushy? I've never handled this kind of thing before. Is there a better way I should've gone about it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a boyfriend throwing iced tea at her after she tapped him on the leg, and the author telling him he needs therapy or she's leaving.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation. The boyfriend had mentioned before he had anger issues, so the author knew about that. The incident wasn't violent in a serious way\u2014just throwing a cup of iced tea. But it resulted in the author getting wet and a bit hurt. The boyfriend apologized and said he reacted without thinking. \n\nThe author's response was to set a boundary: therapy or she leaves. The question is whether that's too pushy. From a relationship perspective, setting boundaries is important, especially when there's a history of anger issues. Anger can escalate, so seeking therapy is a reasonable step. The author isn't asking for something extreme; therapy is a common solution for managing emotions.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction was immediate but he apologized and regretted it. The author is trying to protect herself by ensuring he gets help before any more incidents. The fact that he agreed to therapy suggests he's willing to address the issue. \n\nIs the author being too pushy? Maybe not. In a healthy relationship, both partners should feel safe. If one partner's behavior could lead to harm, it's responsible to address it. The author is taking a firm but reasonable stance. She's not cutting him off immediately but giving him a chance to get help. \n\nHowever, some might argue that it's a small incident over a joke, and that the threat of leaving is extreme. But given the history of anger issues mentioned, it's a valid concern. The author isn't overreacting; she's using the information she has to protect the relationship's future. \n\nI think the author is in the right here. She's setting a boundary to ensure her safety and the relationship's health. The boyfriend's reaction was unprovoked and escalated a minor situation, so the author's demand for therapy is appropriate.\n"
