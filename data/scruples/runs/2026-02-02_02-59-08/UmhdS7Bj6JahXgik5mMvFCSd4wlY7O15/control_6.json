We really just clicked in the very beginning and he's talked about how comfortable and safe he feels with me, and I honestly (even now) feel the same. \n\nNow, he's mentioned that he can get pretty irrationally angry about stuff, but I used to be one angry motherfucker about literally anything and everything, so I didn't really mind, so long as nothing came of it. \nI'm not saying I'm fail-proof, but I honestly hadn't gotten any red flags for the violent / abusive type. We were just two teenagers enjoying each other's company. \n\nWell, tonight I got a glimpse of what he actually meant when he mentioned his anger issues. \n\nWe were walking back to his place after getting dinner and some iced tea; we each had our own cups, they were just your regular plastic cups so nothing too...hard. \n\nHe was walking in front of me and I made a quip about something and tapped him in the back of the leg with my foot. \n\nHe paused for half a second then whipped around and threw his tea, cup and all, right into my face. Luckily, it was iced, so I didn't get burns or anything. \n\nI was honestly pretty angry. It got everywhere, and initially kinda hurt a little bit. I didn't say anything, I just stormed off and went back to his place to grab my shit and leave...\n\n\nWell he came in about five seconds behind me, having said nothing as well. I stood there and cried and asked why he hadn't just told me he was mad that I had jabbed him, and he apologized twenty times over. He said he didn't even register the anger at first, he just reacted, but he immediately regretted it afterwards. \n\nHere's where the AITA comes in: I told him that I wanted him to get therapy to work on his anger issues. I said that he was going to get help, or I was leaving. That if it happened again, I was leaving. And that was that. \n\nHe promised he would get help and that he felt terrible about it, and we laid down and talked for a little while longer, and now I'm home. \n\nTL:DR: My boyfriend has mentioned he can sometimes be irrationally angry. Figured it was sort of just \"teenage boy syndrome\" and shrugged it off. Tonight, he threw his cup of tea at me. I told him he either got professional help for it or I was leaving, and I'm absolutely going to hold him to it. My way or the highway - but I'll be the one hitting the road. \n\nAm I being too pushy? I've never handled this kind of thing before. Is there a better way I should've gone about it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" story is in the wrong. The situation involves the boyfriend throwing a cup of tea at the author after she tapped him on the leg. The author then tells him he needs therapy or she's leaving. The options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no).\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The boyfriend has mentioned before having anger issues, which the author was somewhat familiar with. The incident happened when she made a joke and tapped his leg, and he reacted by throwing the tea. The immediate reaction was violent, even if it was a plastic cup. The author then sets a boundary, demanding he get help or she leaves.\n\nIs the author being too pushy? Well, setting boundaries in relationships is important. The boyfriend's action of throwing the tea, even if it was cold, is a form of physical aggression, albeit minor. The author is concerned about his anger issues and wants him to address it. Therapy is a reasonable suggestion, especially if someone has expressed a tendency towards anger problems.\n\nOn the other hand, could the author have handled it differently? Maybe. She could have discussed therapy without making it a ultimatum. However, ultimatums can be necessary if the behavior is a deal-breaker. The key here is that the boyfriend's reaction was unprovoked and potentially dangerous. The author is protecting herself by setting a clear boundary. \n\nIs she in the wrong? Probably not. She's responding to a red flag. The boyfriend's action shows a lack of impulse control, and the author is taking a stand for her safety and comfort. Even though she's young, her decision to leave if he doesn't seek help is a valid choice. The fact that he apologized and agreed to get help suggests that he recognizes the issue. \n\nSo the answer should be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
