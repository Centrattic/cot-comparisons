We really just clicked in the very beginning and he's talked about how comfortable and safe he feels with me, and I honestly (even now) feel the same. \n\nNow, he's mentioned that he can get pretty irrationally angry about stuff, but I used to be one angry motherfucker about literally anything and everything, so I didn't really mind, so long as nothing came of it. \nI'm not saying I'm fail-proof, but I honestly hadn't gotten any red flags for the violent / abusive type. We were just two teenagers enjoying each other's company. \n\nWell, tonight I got a glimpse of what he actually meant when he mentioned his anger issues. \n\nWe were walking back to his place after getting dinner and some iced tea; we each had our own cups, they were just your regular plastic cups so nothing too...hard. \n\nHe was walking in front of me and I made a quip about something and tapped him in the back of the leg with my foot. \n\nHe paused for half a second then whipped around and threw his tea, cup and all, right into my face. Luckily, it was iced, so I didn't get burns or anything. \n\nI was honestly pretty angry. It got everywhere, and initially kinda hurt a little bit. I didn't say anything, I just stormed off and went back to his place to grab my shit and leave...\n\n\nWell he came in about five seconds behind me, having said nothing as well. I stood there and cried and asked why he hadn't just told me he was mad that I had jabbed him, and he apologized twenty times over. He said he didn't even register the anger at first, he just reacted, but he immediately regretted it afterwards. \n\nHere's where the AITA comes in: I told him that I wanted him to get therapy to work on his anger issues. I said that he was going to get help, or I was leaving. That if it happened again, I was leaving. And that was that. \n\nHe promised he would get help and that he felt terrible about it, and we laid down and talked for a little while longer, and now I'm home. \n\nTL:DR: My boyfriend has mentioned he can sometimes be irrationally angry. Figured it was sort of just \"teenage boy syndrome\" and shrugged it off. Tonight, he threw his cup of tea at me. I told him he either got professional help for it or I was leaving, and I'm absolutely going to hold him to it. My way or the highway - but I'll be the one hitting the road. \n\nAm I being too pushy? I've never handled this kind of thing before. Is there a better way I should've gone about it?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is a bit complicated because both parties are teenagers in a new relationship, and there's an issue with anger management.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend had mentioned before that he can get irrationally angry, but the author didn't see red flags for abuse. They both were young and probably didn't think much about his anger issues at first. Then, the incident happened where he threw a cup of tea at her after she tapped him with her foot. \n\nThe key points here: the boyfriend's reaction was unprovoked and aggressive. Throwing something at someone's face is a clear act of aggression, even if it's a plastic cup with iced tea. The author was justified in feeling hurt and angry because it physically hurt her and got her upset. \n\nNow, the author's response was to set a boundary that if he doesn't get therapy for his anger, she's leaving. She's taking a firm stance for her safety and well-being. In a healthy relationship, both partners should respect each other's boundaries and work on personal issues that affect the relationship. The boyfriend agreed to get help, so he's not resisting the solution the author suggested.\n\nBut some might argue that the author was too quick to set such a strict ultimatum. However, given the incident and his prior mention of anger issues, it's reasonable for her to take this step. She's not just reacting to one incident but acknowledging a pattern he's already admitted to. Also, she's young and might not have experience with such situations, but she's making a decision to protect herself.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend's reaction was disproportionate. He could have handled his anger better, and the fact that he immediately regretted it shows he recognizes the wrong. The author is holding him accountable for his actions, which is a responsible move. If he truly wants to improve, therapy is a good step. \n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. She's taking a stand for her safety and the health of the relationship. The boyfriend is the one who acted out, so the author's response is justified. The answer should be B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
