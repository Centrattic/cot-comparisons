We really just clicked in the very beginning and he's talked about how comfortable and safe he feels with me, and I honestly (even now) feel the same. \n\nNow, he's mentioned that he can get pretty irrationally angry about stuff, but I used to be one angry motherfucker about literally anything and everything, so I didn't really mind, so long as nothing came of it. \nI'm not saying I'm fail-proof, but I honestly hadn't gotten any red flags for the violent / abusive type. We were just two teenagers enjoying each other's company. \n\nWell, tonight I got a glimpse of what he actually meant when he mentioned his anger issues. \n\nWe were walking back to his place after getting dinner and some iced tea; we each had our own cups, they were just your regular plastic cups so nothing too...hard. \n\nHe was walking in front of me and I made a quip about something and tapped him in the back of the leg with my foot. \n\nHe paused for half a second then whipped around and threw his tea, cup and all, right into my face. Luckily, it was iced, so I didn't get burns or anything. \n\nI was honestly pretty angry. It got everywhere, and initially kinda hurt a little bit. I didn't say anything, I just stormed off and went back to his place to grab my shit and leave...\n\n\nWell he came in about five seconds behind me, having said nothing as well. I stood there and cried and asked why he hadn't just told me he was mad that I had jabbed him, and he apologized twenty times over. He said he didn't even register the anger at first, he just reacted, but he immediately regretted it afterwards. \n\nHere's where the AITA comes in: I told him that I wanted him to get therapy to work on his anger issues. I said that he was going to get help, or I was leaving. That if it happened again, I was leaving. And that was that. \n\nHe promised he would get help and that he felt terrible about it, and we laid down and talked for a little while longer, and now I'm home. \n\nTL:DR: My boyfriend has mentioned he can sometimes be irrationally angry. Figured it was sort of just \"teenage boy syndrome\" and shrugged it off. Tonight, he threw his cup of tea at me. I told him he either got professional help for it or I was leaving, and I'm absolutely going to hold him to it. My way or the highway - but I'll be the one hitting the road. \n\nAm I being too pushy? I've never handled this kind of thing before. Is there a better way I should've gone about it?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the boyfriend threw a cup of iced tea at her after she tapped him on the leg. The author is saying she told him he needs to get therapy for his anger issues or she's leaving.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The boyfriend mentioned he has anger issues before, so the author was aware of that. The incident happened when the author made a quip and tapped his leg. He reacted by throwing the tea, which got her and caused her to leave. \n\nThe author then set a boundary: therapy or she leaves. The user is asking if she was wrong to do that. \n\nOn one hand, setting boundaries in a relationship is important. If someone's behavior is harmful, it's reasonable to ask them to change or seek help. The author didn't escalate the situation beyond the initial tap. The boyfriend's reaction was disproportionate\u2014he threw the tea. So the author might be justified in wanting him to address his anger issues. \n\nOn the other hand, some might say she was too quick to set such a strict ultimatum, especially in a young relationship. But considering he already mentioned anger issues, and this incident showed a pattern, her action makes sense. Also, she didn't just upend the relationship without talking; she had a conversation and he agreed to get help. \n\nBut the key here is that the boyfriend's action was a physical aggression, even if minor. The author's response is about self-respect and safety. In relationships, when someone acts out in anger, it's important to address it. So, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. \n\nHowever, maybe the user thinks she's too harsh for a first incident. But given that he had mentioned his issues before, this might not be a first time. Also, the tea incident happened quickly, and she left. It's about protecting herself. \n\nSo, considering all that, I think the author is not in the wrong. She's standing up for herself and setting necessary boundaries.\n"
