We really just clicked in the very beginning and he's talked about how comfortable and safe he feels with me, and I honestly (even now) feel the same. \n\nNow, he's mentioned that he can get pretty irrationally angry about stuff, but I used to be one angry motherfucker about literally anything and everything, so I didn't really mind, so long as nothing came of it. \nI'm not saying I'm fail-proof, but I honestly hadn't gotten any red flags for the violent / abusive type. We were just two teenagers enjoying each other's company. \n\nWell, tonight I got a glimpse of what he actually meant when he mentioned his anger issues. \n\nWe were walking back to his place after getting dinner and some iced tea; we each had our own cups, they were just your regular plastic cups so nothing too...hard. \n\nHe was walking in front of me and I made a quip about something and tapped him in the back of the leg with my foot. \n\nHe paused for half a second then whipped around and threw his tea, cup and all, right into my face. Luckily, it was iced, so I didn't get burns or anything. \n\nI was honestly pretty angry. It got everywhere, and initially kinda hurt a little bit. I didn't say anything, I just stormed off and went back to his place to grab my shit and leave...\n\n\nWell he came in about five seconds behind me, having said nothing as well. I stood there and cried and asked why he hadn't just told me he was mad that I had jabbed him, and he apologized twenty times over. He said he didn't even register the anger at first, he just reacted, but he immediately regretted it afterwards. \n\nHere's where the AITA comes in: I told him that I wanted him to get therapy to work on his anger issues. I said that he was going to get help, or I was leaving. That if it happened again, I was leaving. And that was that. \n\nHe promised he would get help and that he felt terrible about it, and we laid down and talked for a little while longer, and now I'm home. \n\nTL:DR: My boyfriend has mentioned he can sometimes be irrationally angry. Figured it was sort of just \"teenage boy syndrome\" and shrugged it off. Tonight, he threw his cup of tea at me. I told him he either got professional help for it or I was leaving, and I'm absolutely going to hold him to it. My way or the highway - but I'll be the one hitting the road. \n\nAm I being too pushy? I've never handled this kind of thing before. Is there a better way I should've gone about it?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author, an 18-year-old girl, is in a relationship with her 19-year-old boyfriend. They've been together a month and a half. The boyfriend had mentioned his anger issues, so the author wasn't too worried. Then, during a walk, she taps him playfully, and he throws his iced tea cup at her face. She gets angry, leaves, and sets a boundary that he must get therapy or she's leaving. She's asking if she's in the wrong for being so firm.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The boyfriend had a history of irrational anger, which he mentioned, so the author was aware. The incident was a physical reaction to a playful tap, leading to a thrown cup causing physical contact, even if not severe. The author then sets a clear boundary. \n\nIs setting a boundary in a relationship wrong? Generally, no. People have the right to set boundaries for their own safety and well-being. Especially since there was prior mention of anger issues, the author taking this incident seriously makes sense. The boyfriend's reaction was not just anger but an immediate physical response, which can be a red flag. The author is asking him to seek professional help, which is a reasonable request given the context. \n\nBut maybe the question is about the firmness of her decision. The author didn't give him any leeway, \"my way or the highway.\" Is that too harsh? Well, in situations where someone's actions could be harmful, especially in a relationship where both are young and figuring things out, setting a clear boundary is understandable. The boyfriend did apologize and promised to get help, so the author's response was to take that seriously. \n\nAlso, considering their ages, they're both teenagers. Emotional maturity can be a factor. The author acted to protect herself, which is valid. If the boyfriend had truly wanted to change, getting therapy is a proactive step. The author isn't forcing him into therapy but is stating that if he doesn't, she can't stay in the relationship. That's a personal choice about her own comfort and safety.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. She's taking responsibility for her needs and safety. The boyfriend's actions, even if he later regretted them, still caused harm. It's important for both parties to respect each other's boundaries. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
