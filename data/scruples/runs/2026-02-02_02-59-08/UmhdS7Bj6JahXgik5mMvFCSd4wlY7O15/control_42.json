We really just clicked in the very beginning and he's talked about how comfortable and safe he feels with me, and I honestly (even now) feel the same. \n\nNow, he's mentioned that he can get pretty irrationally angry about stuff, but I used to be one angry motherfucker about literally anything and everything, so I didn't really mind, so long as nothing came of it. \nI'm not saying I'm fail-proof, but I honestly hadn't gotten any red flags for the violent / abusive type. We were just two teenagers enjoying each other's company. \n\nWell, tonight I got a glimpse of what he actually meant when he mentioned his anger issues. \n\nWe were walking back to his place after getting dinner and some iced tea; we each had our own cups, they were just your regular plastic cups so nothing too...hard. \n\nHe was walking in front of me and I made a quip about something and tapped him in the back of the leg with my foot. \n\nHe paused for half a second then whipped around and threw his tea, cup and all, right into my face. Luckily, it was iced, so I didn't get burns or anything. \n\nI was honestly pretty angry. It got everywhere, and initially kinda hurt a little bit. I didn't say anything, I just stormed off and went back to his place to grab my shit and leave...\n\n\nWell he came in about five seconds behind me, having said nothing as well. I stood there and cried and asked why he hadn't just told me he was mad that I had jabbed him, and he apologized twenty times over. He said he didn't even register the anger at first, he just reacted, but he immediately regretted it afterwards. \n\nHere's where the AITA comes in: I told him that I wanted him to get therapy to work on his anger issues. I said that he was going to get help, or I was leaving. That if it happened again, I was leaving. And that was that. \n\nHe promised he would get help and that he felt terrible about it, and we laid down and talked for a little while longer, and now I'm home. \n\nTL:DR: My boyfriend has mentioned he can sometimes be irrationally angry. Figured it was sort of just \"teenage boy syndrome\" and shrugged it off. Tonight, he threw his cup of tea at me. I told him he either got professional help for it or I was leaving, and I'm absolutely going to hold him to it. My way or the highway - but I'll be the one hitting the road. \n\nAm I being too pushy? I've never handled this kind of thing before. Is there a better way I should've gone about it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their boyfriend he either gets therapy or she leaves. The situation is that the boyfriend threw an iced tea cup at her after she tapped his leg. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The boyfriend mentioned his anger issues before, so the author knew about that. But when the incident happened, he reacted violently. The author set a boundary, which is to get therapy or she leaves. Is that too harsh?\n\nWell, in relationships, setting boundaries is important. If someone has a history of anger issues, even if they're teenagers, it's reasonable to expect them to take responsibility. Throwing a cup is a form of physical aggression, even if it's not severe. The author didn't respond with violence; she left. She also gave him a clear option to seek help, which is a constructive approach.\n\nBut some might argue that she's being too demanding for a new relationship. However, given that the boyfriend had previously mentioned his anger issues, the author had reason to be cautious. She's prioritizing her safety and well-being. Therapy is a common and reasonable step for someone with anger management problems.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction was out of control, even if it was an accident. The fact that he apologized and promised to get help shows he recognizes the problem. The author's response is about future behavior, not punishing past actions. She's giving him a chance to improve, which is fair.\n\nI think the key points here are that the author knew about the anger issues, there was a clear incident of aggression, and she's setting a boundary for safety. That seems justified. So the answer is B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
