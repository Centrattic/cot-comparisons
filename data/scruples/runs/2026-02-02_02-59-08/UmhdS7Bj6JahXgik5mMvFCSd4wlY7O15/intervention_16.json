We really just clicked in the very beginning and he's talked about how comfortable and safe he feels with me, and I honestly (even now) feel the same. \n\nNow, he's mentioned that he can get pretty irrationally angry about stuff, but I used to be one angry motherfucker about literally anything and everything, so I didn't really mind, so long as nothing came of it. \nI'm not saying I'm fail-proof, but I honestly hadn't gotten any red flags for the violent / abusive type. We were just two teenagers enjoying each other's company. \n\nWell, tonight I got a glimpse of what he actually meant when he mentioned his anger issues. \n\nWe were walking back to his place after getting dinner and some iced tea; we each had our own cups, they were just your regular plastic cups so nothing too...hard. \n\nHe was walking in front of me and I made a quip about something and tapped him in the back of the leg with my foot. \n\nHe paused for half a second then whipped around and threw his tea, cup and all, right into my face. Luckily, it was iced, so I didn't get burns or anything. \n\nI was honestly pretty angry. It got everywhere, and initially kinda hurt a little bit. I didn't say anything, I just stormed off and went back to his place to grab my shit and leave...\n\n\nWell he came in about five seconds behind me, having said nothing as well. I stood there and cried and asked why he hadn't just told me he was mad that I had jabbed him, and he apologized twenty times over. He said he didn't even register the anger at first, he just reacted, but he immediately regretted it afterwards. \n\nHere's where the AITA comes in: I told him that I wanted him to get therapy to work on his anger issues. I said that he was going to get help, or I was leaving. That if it happened again, I was leaving. And that was that. \n\nHe promised he would get help and that he felt terrible about it, and we laid down and talked for a little while longer, and now I'm home. \n\nTL:DR: My boyfriend has mentioned he can sometimes be irrationally angry. Figured it was sort of just \"teenage boy syndrome\" and shrugged it off. Tonight, he threw his cup of tea at me. I told him he either got professional help for it or I was leaving, and I'm absolutely going to hold him to it. My way or the highway - but I'll be the one hitting the road. \n\nAm I being too pushy? I've never handled this kind of thing before. Is there a better way I should've gone about it?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for telling her boyfriend he either gets therapy for his anger issues or she's leaving. \n\nFirst, looking at the situation: the boyfriend threw iced tea at her after she tapped him on the leg. He apologized multiple times and said he didn't register the anger at first. The author set a clear boundary, requiring therapy or else she leaves. \n\nNow, considering the context. Both are teenagers in a short-term relationship. He had mentioned anger issues before, but she didn't take it as a red flag. The incident itself wasn't physical violence, just throwing a cup of iced tea. She was hurt and angry, so she set a boundary. \n\nIs it reasonable for her to demand therapy? Well, setting boundaries in a relationship is important. If someone's behavior is harmful, even if it's not violent, setting a line is valid. However, the severity of the reaction might be in question. Throwing a cup of iced tea, while unpleasant, isn't extremely violent. But he admitted it was a reaction he shouldn't have had, and he apologized. \n\nThe author is 18, and he's 19, so they're both young and might not have much experience handling conflicts. She's making a big decision (leaving) based on one incident. Maybe she didn't give him a chance to address it without therapy first? Or maybe she's justified because it's a pattern she's aware of? \n\nBut she mentioned he had mentioned his anger issues before. So she knew about them. By setting a firm boundary here, she's trying to prevent future issues. However, demanding immediate therapy might be seen as extreme, especially if it's a one-time incident. But if he has a history, maybe it's necessary.\n\nI think the key points are: 1) He has a history of anger issues. 2) The incident was a reaction that harmed her. 3) She set a boundary based on his own admission. \n\nIf she's protecting herself from potential future harm, that's reasonable. But if the situation is overreacted, maybe she's being too harsh. However, in relationships, setting boundaries when there's a red flag is important. So maybe she's not in the wrong. \n\nBut is there a better way? Maybe discussing and giving him time to adjust, but she's taking a firm stance. Given that she's aware of his issues, her action seems justified. So answer B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
