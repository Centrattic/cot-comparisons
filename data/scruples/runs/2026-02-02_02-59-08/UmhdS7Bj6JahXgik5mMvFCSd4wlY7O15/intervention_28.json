We really just clicked in the very beginning and he's talked about how comfortable and safe he feels with me, and I honestly (even now) feel the same. \n\nNow, he's mentioned that he can get pretty irrationally angry about stuff, but I used to be one angry motherfucker about literally anything and everything, so I didn't really mind, so long as nothing came of it. \nI'm not saying I'm fail-proof, but I honestly hadn't gotten any red flags for the violent / abusive type. We were just two teenagers enjoying each other's company. \n\nWell, tonight I got a glimpse of what he actually meant when he mentioned his anger issues. \n\nWe were walking back to his place after getting dinner and some iced tea; we each had our own cups, they were just your regular plastic cups so nothing too...hard. \n\nHe was walking in front of me and I made a quip about something and tapped him in the back of the leg with my foot. \n\nHe paused for half a second then whipped around and threw his tea, cup and all, right into my face. Luckily, it was iced, so I didn't get burns or anything. \n\nI was honestly pretty angry. It got everywhere, and initially kinda hurt a little bit. I didn't say anything, I just stormed off and went back to his place to grab my shit and leave...\n\n\nWell he came in about five seconds behind me, having said nothing as well. I stood there and cried and asked why he hadn't just told me he was mad that I had jabbed him, and he apologized twenty times over. He said he didn't even register the anger at first, he just reacted, but he immediately regretted it afterwards. \n\nHere's where the AITA comes in: I told him that I wanted him to get therapy to work on his anger issues. I said that he was going to get help, or I was leaving. That if it happened again, I was leaving. And that was that. \n\nHe promised he would get help and that he felt terrible about it, and we laid down and talked for a little while longer, and now I'm home. \n\nTL:DR: My boyfriend has mentioned he can sometimes be irrationally angry. Figured it was sort of just \"teenage boy syndrome\" and shrugged it off. Tonight, he threw his cup of tea at me. I told him he either got professional help for it or I was leaving, and I'm absolutely going to hold him to it. My way or the highway - but I'll be the one hitting the road. \n\nAm I being too pushy? I've never handled this kind of thing before. Is there a better way I should've gone about it?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the story is in the wrong by setting a firm boundary with her boyfriend after he threw iced tea in her face. \n\nFirst, the boyfriend has mentioned his anger issues before, so the author wasn't completely blindsided. She acknowledged his past comments but didn't take action until the incident. The key point here is that he acted out in a way that was physically aggressive, even if it was a minor act. Throwing a cup of iced tea isn't violent in the sense of causing serious harm, but it's still an act of aggression. \n\nThe author then tells him he has to get therapy or she's leaving. The user thinks she's in the wrong, but I need to consider the context. In relationships, setting boundaries is crucial. The author is responding to a specific incident that violated her comfort and safety. She's making a decision based on his prior mentions of anger issues, which she now sees as a red flag.\n\nIs she being pushy? Maybe, but when someone's behavior is harmful or has the potential to escalate, setting a firm boundary isn't unreasonable. Therapy is a common and reasonable recommendation for managing anger. The boyfriend's immediate regret and apology suggest he recognizes his mistake, but the author is taking a proactive stance to prevent future issues.\n\nHowever, some might argue that throwing iced tea isn't a severe enough act to warrant such a strict ultimatum. But considering his prior warning about his anger, she's acting on a pattern of behavior. It's about her safety and comfort. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't the one who committed the act. She's the one setting a boundary to protect herself. So, she's not in the wrong for doing that. The boyfriend is responsible for his actions, and the author is holding him accountable. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
