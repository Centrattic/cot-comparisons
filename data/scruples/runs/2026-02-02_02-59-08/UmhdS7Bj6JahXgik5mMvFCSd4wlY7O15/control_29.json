We really just clicked in the very beginning and he's talked about how comfortable and safe he feels with me, and I honestly (even now) feel the same. \n\nNow, he's mentioned that he can get pretty irrationally angry about stuff, but I used to be one angry motherfucker about literally anything and everything, so I didn't really mind, so long as nothing came of it. \nI'm not saying I'm fail-proof, but I honestly hadn't gotten any red flags for the violent / abusive type. We were just two teenagers enjoying each other's company. \n\nWell, tonight I got a glimpse of what he actually meant when he mentioned his anger issues. \n\nWe were walking back to his place after getting dinner and some iced tea; we each had our own cups, they were just your regular plastic cups so nothing too...hard. \n\nHe was walking in front of me and I made a quip about something and tapped him in the back of the leg with my foot. \n\nHe paused for half a second then whipped around and threw his tea, cup and all, right into my face. Luckily, it was iced, so I didn't get burns or anything. \n\nI was honestly pretty angry. It got everywhere, and initially kinda hurt a little bit. I didn't say anything, I just stormed off and went back to his place to grab my shit and leave...\n\n\nWell he came in about five seconds behind me, having said nothing as well. I stood there and cried and asked why he hadn't just told me he was mad that I had jabbed him, and he apologized twenty times over. He said he didn't even register the anger at first, he just reacted, but he immediately regretted it afterwards. \n\nHere's where the AITA comes in: I told him that I wanted him to get therapy to work on his anger issues. I said that he was going to get help, or I was leaving. That if it happened again, I was leaving. And that was that. \n\nHe promised he would get help and that he felt terrible about it, and we laid down and talked for a little while longer, and now I'm home. \n\nTL:DR: My boyfriend has mentioned he can sometimes be irrationally angry. Figured it was sort of just \"teenage boy syndrome\" and shrugged it off. Tonight, he threw his cup of tea at me. I told him he either got professional help for it or I was leaving, and I'm absolutely going to hold him to it. My way or the highway - but I'll be the one hitting the road. \n\nAm I being too pushy? I've never handled this kind of thing before. Is there a better way I should've gone about it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for telling her boyfriend to get therapy or she'll leave. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend is 19, the author is 18. They've been together a month and a half. He mentioned his anger issues before, so she wasn't completely out of the blue. The incident happened when she tapped his leg, which triggered him to throw his tea at her face. That sounds pretty aggressive, even if it was iced tea. She left after that, and then told him he needs therapy or she's leaving. He agreed and apologized.\n\nNow, the key points here are: he had prior warning about his anger, she tried to address it calmly, and the action he took was physically aggressive towards her. She's setting a boundary here. The question is if she's being too pushy. But setting boundaries in a relationship, especially regarding safety, is usually considered healthy. If someone has anger issues and acts out physically, getting help is a reasonable expectation. Plus, they're both teenagers, so maybe she's trying to handle it maturely.\n\nBut some might argue that she's giving an ultimatum too quickly. However, considering the nature of the act\u2014throwing a cup of tea in someone's face\u2014that's not just a minor issue. It's a physical assault. So setting a firm boundary makes sense. Therapy is a common recommendation for anger management. The author isn't asking for something unreasonable. She's also considering her safety and emotional well-being.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction was immediate regret and apologizing, which might indicate he's aware it was wrong. So the author's stance is about future behavior, not just past. She's giving him a chance to get help, which is proactive. If he doesn't, she's walking away. That seems justified because staying in a relationship where there's potential for physical aggression is risky.\n\nI don't see any red flags from the author's side. She's acknowledging his prior mentions of anger issues, addressing the incident, and setting a clear boundary. The boyfriend's action was the problem. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
