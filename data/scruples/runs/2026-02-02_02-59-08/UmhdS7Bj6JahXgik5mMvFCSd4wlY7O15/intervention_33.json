We really just clicked in the very beginning and he's talked about how comfortable and safe he feels with me, and I honestly (even now) feel the same. \n\nNow, he's mentioned that he can get pretty irrationally angry about stuff, but I used to be one angry motherfucker about literally anything and everything, so I didn't really mind, so long as nothing came of it. \nI'm not saying I'm fail-proof, but I honestly hadn't gotten any red flags for the violent / abusive type. We were just two teenagers enjoying each other's company. \n\nWell, tonight I got a glimpse of what he actually meant when he mentioned his anger issues. \n\nWe were walking back to his place after getting dinner and some iced tea; we each had our own cups, they were just your regular plastic cups so nothing too...hard. \n\nHe was walking in front of me and I made a quip about something and tapped him in the back of the leg with my foot. \n\nHe paused for half a second then whipped around and threw his tea, cup and all, right into my face. Luckily, it was iced, so I didn't get burns or anything. \n\nI was honestly pretty angry. It got everywhere, and initially kinda hurt a little bit. I didn't say anything, I just stormed off and went back to his place to grab my shit and leave...\n\n\nWell he came in about five seconds behind me, having said nothing as well. I stood there and cried and asked why he hadn't just told me he was mad that I had jabbed him, and he apologized twenty times over. He said he didn't even register the anger at first, he just reacted, but he immediately regretted it afterwards. \n\nHere's where the AITA comes in: I told him that I wanted him to get therapy to work on his anger issues. I said that he was going to get help, or I was leaving. That if it happened again, I was leaving. And that was that. \n\nHe promised he would get help and that he felt terrible about it, and we laid down and talked for a little while longer, and now I'm home. \n\nTL:DR: My boyfriend has mentioned he can sometimes be irrationally angry. Figured it was sort of just \"teenage boy syndrome\" and shrugged it off. Tonight, he threw his cup of tea at me. I told him he either got professional help for it or I was leaving, and I'm absolutely going to hold him to it. My way or the highway - but I'll be the one hitting the road. \n\nAm I being too pushy? I've never handled this kind of thing before. Is there a better way I should've gone about it?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the scenario) is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's boyfriend, who's 19, had a sudden outburst where he threw iced tea at her after she tapped his leg. The author then told him he needs to get therapy for his anger issues or she's leaving.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The boyfriend mentioned his anger issues before, so the author was aware. This incident where he threw the tea was an example of that. The author set a boundary: either get help or she's leaving. She followed through by leaving after the incident.\n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFrom a relationship advice perspective, setting boundaries around abusive behavior is generally seen as right. The author is taking a stance against potential abuse, especially since the boyfriend had prior mentioned his anger issues. The action of throwing tea, while not physically severe, could be a sign of a pattern. The author is prioritizing her safety and well-being by demanding accountability.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that she was too hasty or that the situation wasn't that serious. However, considering the boyfriend's own admission about his anger and the potential for escalation, her reaction is understandable. She's not in the wrong for protecting herself. The boyfriend's actions, even if impulsive, are his responsibility to address. The author is not forcing him to get therapy; she's stating that if he doesn't, she can't stay in the relationship. That's a valid choice, especially given the context.\n\nAnother angle: the boyfriend apologized and promised to get help, which suggests he acknowledges the problem. The author's firm stance might encourage him to take the issue seriously. In relationships, communication and mutual respect for each other's boundaries are crucial. The author is asserting hers, which is a right she has.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. She's acting in her own best interest and the relationship's health by addressing a red flag early on. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
