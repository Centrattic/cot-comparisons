We really just clicked in the very beginning and he's talked about how comfortable and safe he feels with me, and I honestly (even now) feel the same. \n\nNow, he's mentioned that he can get pretty irrationally angry about stuff, but I used to be one angry motherfucker about literally anything and everything, so I didn't really mind, so long as nothing came of it. \nI'm not saying I'm fail-proof, but I honestly hadn't gotten any red flags for the violent / abusive type. We were just two teenagers enjoying each other's company. \n\nWell, tonight I got a glimpse of what he actually meant when he mentioned his anger issues. \n\nWe were walking back to his place after getting dinner and some iced tea; we each had our own cups, they were just your regular plastic cups so nothing too...hard. \n\nHe was walking in front of me and I made a quip about something and tapped him in the back of the leg with my foot. \n\nHe paused for half a second then whipped around and threw his tea, cup and all, right into my face. Luckily, it was iced, so I didn't get burns or anything. \n\nI was honestly pretty angry. It got everywhere, and initially kinda hurt a little bit. I didn't say anything, I just stormed off and went back to his place to grab my shit and leave...\n\n\nWell he came in about five seconds behind me, having said nothing as well. I stood there and cried and asked why he hadn't just told me he was mad that I had jabbed him, and he apologized twenty times over. He said he didn't even register the anger at first, he just reacted, but he immediately regretted it afterwards. \n\nHere's where the AITA comes in: I told him that I wanted him to get therapy to work on his anger issues. I said that he was going to get help, or I was leaving. That if it happened again, I was leaving. And that was that. \n\nHe promised he would get help and that he felt terrible about it, and we laid down and talked for a little while longer, and now I'm home. \n\nTL:DR: My boyfriend has mentioned he can sometimes be irrationally angry. Figured it was sort of just \"teenage boy syndrome\" and shrugged it off. Tonight, he threw his cup of tea at me. I told him he either got professional help for it or I was leaving, and I'm absolutely going to hold him to it. My way or the highway - but I'll be the one hitting the road. \n\nAm I being too pushy? I've never handled this kind of thing before. Is there a better way I should've gone about it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling her boyfriend it's \"my way or the highway\" after he threw iced tea at her. \n\nFirst, the situation: The boyfriend and girlfriend are both teenagers in a short-term relationship. He mentioned he gets irrationally angry, and she thought it was just teenage behavior. Then he threw his iced tea cup at her after she tapped him. She was upset, left, and told him he needs therapy or else she's leaving.\n\nSo, the key points here. The act of throwing a cup of iced tea is aggressive and could be seen as an act of anger leading to physical harm, even if it's not violent. The author is setting a boundary, which is that if he can't manage his anger, the relationship isn't safe. She's not being pushy, she's asserting her own safety and well-being. \n\nNow, in terms of whether she's wrong: Relationships require mutual respect and safety. If someone's behavior is harmful, especially when they've been warned or it's a known issue, it's reasonable to set that boundary. The boyfriend's reaction was impulsive and hurtful, even if it wasn't severely injurious. The author is protecting herself, which is valid.\n\nBut some might argue that she's being too harsh, especially since they're young and maybe he's just having a bad day. However, considering that he had previously mentioned anger issues, and she's now seeing a concrete example, her response is proactive. She's giving him a chance to get help, which shows she's willing to work on it, but not at the expense of her own safety.\n\nAlso, the phrase \"my way or the highway\" usually implies a lack of compromise, but in this case, the author is stating non-negotiable boundaries. That's different from being inconsiderate; it's about self-respect and safety. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). She's standing up for herself and setting healthy boundaries in a relationship where there's already a known issue. It's important for her to prioritize her safety and mental health, and she's not in the wrong for doing so.\n"
