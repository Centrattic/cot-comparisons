We really just clicked in the very beginning and he's talked about how comfortable and safe he feels with me, and I honestly (even now) feel the same. \n\nNow, he's mentioned that he can get pretty irrationally angry about stuff, but I used to be one angry motherfucker about literally anything and everything, so I didn't really mind, so long as nothing came of it. \nI'm not saying I'm fail-proof, but I honestly hadn't gotten any red flags for the violent / abusive type. We were just two teenagers enjoying each other's company. \n\nWell, tonight I got a glimpse of what he actually meant when he mentioned his anger issues. \n\nWe were walking back to his place after getting dinner and some iced tea; we each had our own cups, they were just your regular plastic cups so nothing too...hard. \n\nHe was walking in front of me and I made a quip about something and tapped him in the back of the leg with my foot. \n\nHe paused for half a second then whipped around and threw his tea, cup and all, right into my face. Luckily, it was iced, so I didn't get burns or anything. \n\nI was honestly pretty angry. It got everywhere, and initially kinda hurt a little bit. I didn't say anything, I just stormed off and went back to his place to grab my shit and leave...\n\n\nWell he came in about five seconds behind me, having said nothing as well. I stood there and cried and asked why he hadn't just told me he was mad that I had jabbed him, and he apologized twenty times over. He said he didn't even register the anger at first, he just reacted, but he immediately regretted it afterwards. \n\nHere's where the AITA comes in: I told him that I wanted him to get therapy to work on his anger issues. I said that he was going to get help, or I was leaving. That if it happened again, I was leaving. And that was that. \n\nHe promised he would get help and that he felt terrible about it, and we laid down and talked for a little while longer, and now I'm home. \n\nTL:DR: My boyfriend has mentioned he can sometimes be irrationally angry. Figured it was sort of just \"teenage boy syndrome\" and shrugged it off. Tonight, he threw his cup of tea at me. I told him he either got professional help for it or I was leaving, and I'm absolutely going to hold him to it. My way or the highway - but I'll be the one hitting the road. \n\nAm I being too pushy? I've never handled this kind of thing before. Is there a better way I should've gone about it?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the AITA post) is in the wrong for telling her boyfriend he needs therapy or she's leaving. \n\nFirst, the situation: They're both teenagers, 18 and 19, in a two-month relationship. The boyfriend had mentioned anger issues before, and the author thought it was manageable. Then he threw a cup of tea at her after she tapped him. She left, and told him he needs therapy or she's leaving.\n\nNow, the key points. The boyfriend had previously mentioned his anger issues, so the author wasn't completely unaware. The act of throwing a cup of tea, while not physically severe (it was iced and no burns), is still an aggressive action. The author's response was to set a boundary, demanding therapy or a breakup. \n\nIs she in the wrong for being firm? Well, setting boundaries in a relationship is important. If someone's behavior makes you feel unsafe, even if it's not violent, it's reasonable to address it. The boyfriend's reaction was impulsive and harmful, even if he apologized. The author isn't wrong for taking a stand, especially since he had a history of anger issues. \n\nBut some might argue she was too quick to demand therapy. However, given that he had warned her before, and the incident escalated, her response seems justified. She's also young, so her handling might be seen as mature in standing up for herself. \n\nAnother angle: The boyfriend's action was a split-second reaction. He apologized and regretted it. But the fact remains that he physically attacked her. Even if it was a cup of tea, it's an act of aggression. The author's decision to require therapy shows she's prioritizing her safety and mental health. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often values communication and boundaries. The author communicated her needs clearly. She didn't escalate the situation beyond the initial incident. So, she's not in the wrong here. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
