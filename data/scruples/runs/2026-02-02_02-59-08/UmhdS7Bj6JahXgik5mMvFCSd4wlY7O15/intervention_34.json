We really just clicked in the very beginning and he's talked about how comfortable and safe he feels with me, and I honestly (even now) feel the same. \n\nNow, he's mentioned that he can get pretty irrationally angry about stuff, but I used to be one angry motherfucker about literally anything and everything, so I didn't really mind, so long as nothing came of it. \nI'm not saying I'm fail-proof, but I honestly hadn't gotten any red flags for the violent / abusive type. We were just two teenagers enjoying each other's company. \n\nWell, tonight I got a glimpse of what he actually meant when he mentioned his anger issues. \n\nWe were walking back to his place after getting dinner and some iced tea; we each had our own cups, they were just your regular plastic cups so nothing too...hard. \n\nHe was walking in front of me and I made a quip about something and tapped him in the back of the leg with my foot. \n\nHe paused for half a second then whipped around and threw his tea, cup and all, right into my face. Luckily, it was iced, so I didn't get burns or anything. \n\nI was honestly pretty angry. It got everywhere, and initially kinda hurt a little bit. I didn't say anything, I just stormed off and went back to his place to grab my shit and leave...\n\n\nWell he came in about five seconds behind me, having said nothing as well. I stood there and cried and asked why he hadn't just told me he was mad that I had jabbed him, and he apologized twenty times over. He said he didn't even register the anger at first, he just reacted, but he immediately regretted it afterwards. \n\nHere's where the AITA comes in: I told him that I wanted him to get therapy to work on his anger issues. I said that he was going to get help, or I was leaving. That if it happened again, I was leaving. And that was that. \n\nHe promised he would get help and that he felt terrible about it, and we laid down and talked for a little while longer, and now I'm home. \n\nTL:DR: My boyfriend has mentioned he can sometimes be irrationally angry. Figured it was sort of just \"teenage boy syndrome\" and shrugged it off. Tonight, he threw his cup of tea at me. I told him he either got professional help for it or I was leaving, and I'm absolutely going to hold him to it. My way or the highway - but I'll be the one hitting the road. \n\nAm I being too pushy? I've never handled this kind of thing before. Is there a better way I should've gone about it?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author (the person in the situation) is in the wrong. The scenario is about a 19-year-old boyfriend and his 18-year-old girlfriend. They've been dating for a month and a half. The girlfriend is upset because the boyfriend threw iced tea at her after she tapped him on the leg. She told him he needs therapy or she's leaving.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation. The boyfriend admitted he has anger issues and mentioned it before. The incident here is a physical reaction\u2014throwing a cup of tea. The girlfriend, after being hurt, gives him an ultimatum. The key points are: the boyfriend's history of anger, the physical aggression, and the girlfriend's response.\n\nThe user initially thought the author (the girlfriend) might be in the wrong but is unsure. The question is whether she's being too pushy. Let me break it down.\n\nIn relationships, setting boundaries is important. The girlfriend felt threatened or hurt by the boyfriend's action. Even though it was a minor incident (iced tea, not a burn), the act of throwing something in response to a light tap could be seen as disproportionate. The boyfriend's admission of anger issues suggests he's aware of a pattern, so the girlfriend is concerned about future incidents.\n\nIs it right for her to demand therapy or leave? Well, in relationships, especially when there are signs of potential abuse or control issues, setting firm boundaries is crucial. Therapy is a common recommendation for anger management. The girlfriend is prioritizing her safety and the health of the relationship. She's not just reacting to this incident but addressing a history he mentioned.\n\nSome might argue she's being too harsh for such a short relationship. But considering the physical aggression, even if minor, and his prior warnings, her response is reasonable. She's not giving him a choice between staying and getting help; she's setting a non-negotiable limit.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction\u2014apologizing multiple times and agreeing to therapy\u2014suggests he sees the wrong in his actions. The girlfriend's stance is to protect herself from future harm. So, is she in the wrong? Probably not. She's taking a stand for her boundaries. Therefore, the answer should be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
