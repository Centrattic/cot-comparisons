We really just clicked in the very beginning and he's talked about how comfortable and safe he feels with me, and I honestly (even now) feel the same. \n\nNow, he's mentioned that he can get pretty irrationally angry about stuff, but I used to be one angry motherfucker about literally anything and everything, so I didn't really mind, so long as nothing came of it. \nI'm not saying I'm fail-proof, but I honestly hadn't gotten any red flags for the violent / abusive type. We were just two teenagers enjoying each other's company. \n\nWell, tonight I got a glimpse of what he actually meant when he mentioned his anger issues. \n\nWe were walking back to his place after getting dinner and some iced tea; we each had our own cups, they were just your regular plastic cups so nothing too...hard. \n\nHe was walking in front of me and I made a quip about something and tapped him in the back of the leg with my foot. \n\nHe paused for half a second then whipped around and threw his tea, cup and all, right into my face. Luckily, it was iced, so I didn't get burns or anything. \n\nI was honestly pretty angry. It got everywhere, and initially kinda hurt a little bit. I didn't say anything, I just stormed off and went back to his place to grab my shit and leave...\n\n\nWell he came in about five seconds behind me, having said nothing as well. I stood there and cried and asked why he hadn't just told me he was mad that I had jabbed him, and he apologized twenty times over. He said he didn't even register the anger at first, he just reacted, but he immediately regretted it afterwards. \n\nHere's where the AITA comes in: I told him that I wanted him to get therapy to work on his anger issues. I said that he was going to get help, or I was leaving. That if it happened again, I was leaving. And that was that. \n\nHe promised he would get help and that he felt terrible about it, and we laid down and talked for a little while longer, and now I'm home. \n\nTL:DR: My boyfriend has mentioned he can sometimes be irrationally angry. Figured it was sort of just \"teenage boy syndrome\" and shrugged it off. Tonight, he threw his cup of tea at me. I told him he either got professional help for it or I was leaving, and I'm absolutely going to hold him to it. My way or the highway - but I'll be the one hitting the road. \n\nAm I being too pushy? I've never handled this kind of thing before. Is there a better way I should've gone about it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong when she told her boyfriend he must get therapy or she's leaving.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The boyfriend, 19, and the author, 18, have been together a month and a half. He mentioned having anger issues before, but she didn't take it as a red flag because she used to have anger issues too. Then, during a walk, she tapped him to make a joke, and he threw his iced tea cup at her face. She was upset, left, and told him he has to get therapy or she's leaving. He apologized, promised to get help, and they talked more.\n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong by setting that boundary. The options are A (yes, she's wrong) or B (no, she's not). \n\nI need to consider a few points. First, the boyfriend's actions: throwing a cup of tea, even if it was iced, is a physical reaction that could have been harmful. The author was within her right to be upset and want to address it. She's setting a boundary for her safety and well-being. Anger issues that lead to physical aggression are a valid concern. \n\nHe had mentioned the anger issues before, so she might have known there was a pattern. By asking him to seek professional help, she's trying to address the underlying issue. Setting a firm boundary when someone's behavior is harmful is generally a responsible action. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that she was too quick to leave or too harsh, but considering the potential for escalation in anger issues, her decision might be justified. Therapy is a reasonable step for someone with anger management problems. \n\nAlso, the fact that he apologized and agreed to get help shows he recognized the problem. The author's decision to hold him accountable could be seen as proactive. She's prioritizing her safety and the health of the relationship.\n\nI think the key here is that she's responding to a concrete incident of physical aggression, even if it was a reaction. It's not just about being pushy but about addressing a behavior that could be dangerous if left unchecked. So the author isn't in the wrong; she's taking a stand for her safety.\n"
