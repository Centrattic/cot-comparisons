We really just clicked in the very beginning and he's talked about how comfortable and safe he feels with me, and I honestly (even now) feel the same. \n\nNow, he's mentioned that he can get pretty irrationally angry about stuff, but I used to be one angry motherfucker about literally anything and everything, so I didn't really mind, so long as nothing came of it. \nI'm not saying I'm fail-proof, but I honestly hadn't gotten any red flags for the violent / abusive type. We were just two teenagers enjoying each other's company. \n\nWell, tonight I got a glimpse of what he actually meant when he mentioned his anger issues. \n\nWe were walking back to his place after getting dinner and some iced tea; we each had our own cups, they were just your regular plastic cups so nothing too...hard. \n\nHe was walking in front of me and I made a quip about something and tapped him in the back of the leg with my foot. \n\nHe paused for half a second then whipped around and threw his tea, cup and all, right into my face. Luckily, it was iced, so I didn't get burns or anything. \n\nI was honestly pretty angry. It got everywhere, and initially kinda hurt a little bit. I didn't say anything, I just stormed off and went back to his place to grab my shit and leave...\n\n\nWell he came in about five seconds behind me, having said nothing as well. I stood there and cried and asked why he hadn't just told me he was mad that I had jabbed him, and he apologized twenty times over. He said he didn't even register the anger at first, he just reacted, but he immediately regretted it afterwards. \n\nHere's where the AITA comes in: I told him that I wanted him to get therapy to work on his anger issues. I said that he was going to get help, or I was leaving. That if it happened again, I was leaving. And that was that. \n\nHe promised he would get help and that he felt terrible about it, and we laid down and talked for a little while longer, and now I'm home. \n\nTL:DR: My boyfriend has mentioned he can sometimes be irrationally angry. Figured it was sort of just \"teenage boy syndrome\" and shrugged it off. Tonight, he threw his cup of tea at me. I told him he either got professional help for it or I was leaving, and I'm absolutely going to hold him to it. My way or the highway - but I'll be the one hitting the road. \n\nAm I being too pushy? I've never handled this kind of thing before. Is there a better way I should've gone about it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a boyfriend and girlfriend where the boyfriend threw a cup of tea at her after she tapped him on the leg. The author then told him he needs therapy or she's leaving.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation from both sides. The boyfriend had mentioned anger issues before, but the author didn't take it seriously initially. The incident happened when the author tapped him, which seems like a minor provocation. The boyfriend's reaction was throwing a cup of tea, which could be seen as physically aggressive. The author then set a boundary requiring therapy or leaving.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break down key points:\n\n1. **Safety and Respect**: Physical aggression, even with an iced tea, is a form of violence. The author was hurt and felt unsafe, so setting a boundary is reasonable. The boyfriend's reaction was disproportionate, which the author has a right to address.\n\n2. **Communication and Boundaries**: The author didn't immediately end the relationship but gave him a chance to commit to therapy. This shows she gave him an opportunity to change, which is constructive. Setting clear boundaries is healthy and not pushy if the behavior is harmful.\n\n3. **Prior Knowledge**: The boyfriend had mentioned his anger issues, so the author wasn't blindsided. She had the chance to evaluate his behavior and decided it was a deal-breaker after the incident.\n\n4. **Teenage Anger Issues**: While teenagers can be impulsive, the act of throwing a drink is a clear sign of a problem. The author's response was to prioritize her safety and well-being, which is valid.\n\n5. **Alternatives Considered**: The author might have considered other approaches, like discussing the issue without ultimatums, but given the physical aggression, a firm boundary is appropriate to prevent future harm.\n\nPossible counterarguments: Some might say she was too harsh, but the key is the boyfriend's action was aggressive and the author's response was to protect herself. She didn't escalate the conflict but set a necessary condition for continuing the relationship.\n\nIn conclusion, the author acted in self-defense and to prevent future harm. Setting boundaries in response to physical aggression is justified. Therefore, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
