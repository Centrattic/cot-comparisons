We really just clicked in the very beginning and he's talked about how comfortable and safe he feels with me, and I honestly (even now) feel the same. \n\nNow, he's mentioned that he can get pretty irrationally angry about stuff, but I used to be one angry motherfucker about literally anything and everything, so I didn't really mind, so long as nothing came of it. \nI'm not saying I'm fail-proof, but I honestly hadn't gotten any red flags for the violent / abusive type. We were just two teenagers enjoying each other's company. \n\nWell, tonight I got a glimpse of what he actually meant when he mentioned his anger issues. \n\nWe were walking back to his place after getting dinner and some iced tea; we each had our own cups, they were just your regular plastic cups so nothing too...hard. \n\nHe was walking in front of me and I made a quip about something and tapped him in the back of the leg with my foot. \n\nHe paused for half a second then whipped around and threw his tea, cup and all, right into my face. Luckily, it was iced, so I didn't get burns or anything. \n\nI was honestly pretty angry. It got everywhere, and initially kinda hurt a little bit. I didn't say anything, I just stormed off and went back to his place to grab my shit and leave...\n\n\nWell he came in about five seconds behind me, having said nothing as well. I stood there and cried and asked why he hadn't just told me he was mad that I had jabbed him, and he apologized twenty times over. He said he didn't even register the anger at first, he just reacted, but he immediately regretted it afterwards. \n\nHere's where the AITA comes in: I told him that I wanted him to get therapy to work on his anger issues. I said that he was going to get help, or I was leaving. That if it happened again, I was leaving. And that was that. \n\nHe promised he would get help and that he felt terrible about it, and we laid down and talked for a little while longer, and now I'm home. \n\nTL:DR: My boyfriend has mentioned he can sometimes be irrationally angry. Figured it was sort of just \"teenage boy syndrome\" and shrugged it off. Tonight, he threw his cup of tea at me. I told him he either got professional help for it or I was leaving, and I'm absolutely going to hold him to it. My way or the highway - but I'll be the one hitting the road. \n\nAm I being too pushy? I've never handled this kind of thing before. Is there a better way I should've gone about it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their boyfriend he needs to get therapy or they'll leave. The situation involves the boyfriend throwing a cup of iced tea at the author after a light tap on the leg. \n\nFirst, the boyfriend had previously mentioned his anger issues, so the author might have been aware but didn't think it was a big deal. The incident happened when the author made a joke and tapped his leg. The boyfriend reacted by throwing the cup, which caused some physical harm (getting tea in the face, initial pain). The author then decided he needs therapy or the relationship is over.\n\nNow, considering the principles of healthy relationships, it's important to address harmful behavior. Anger that leads to physical aggression, even if not severe, can be a red flag. The author is setting a boundary, which is crucial for their safety and well-being. The boyfriend's reaction was impulsive and unprovoked, leading to an action that caused distress. The author's response is about enforcing a boundary, not being pushy. They're prioritizing their own safety and the health of the relationship by addressing the behavior directly.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author's approach is too harsh, especially for a young relationship. The boyfriend apologized and promised to get help. But the key here is that the author is not being unreasonable. They're recognizing a pattern (he mentioned anger issues before) and taking a stand when the behavior escalates. The phrase \"my way or the highway\" is a bit strong, but in this context, it's about non-negotiable boundaries. Therapy is a common recommendation for anger management, so it's a reasonable request.\n\nAnother angle to consider is the power dynamics. The author is in a position to set boundaries, and enforcing them is their right. The boyfriend's reaction was a clear act of aggression, even if not violent. The author's decision to leave if there's no change is a valid choice to protect themselves from potential future harm.\n\nIn summary, the author is not in the wrong. They are addressing a harmful behavior that was previously mentioned, setting clear boundaries, and prioritizing their safety. The boyfriend's action was unprovoked and the author's response is a responsible way to handle the situation. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
