We really just clicked in the very beginning and he's talked about how comfortable and safe he feels with me, and I honestly (even now) feel the same. \n\nNow, he's mentioned that he can get pretty irrationally angry about stuff, but I used to be one angry motherfucker about literally anything and everything, so I didn't really mind, so long as nothing came of it. \nI'm not saying I'm fail-proof, but I honestly hadn't gotten any red flags for the violent / abusive type. We were just two teenagers enjoying each other's company. \n\nWell, tonight I got a glimpse of what he actually meant when he mentioned his anger issues. \n\nWe were walking back to his place after getting dinner and some iced tea; we each had our own cups, they were just your regular plastic cups so nothing too...hard. \n\nHe was walking in front of me and I made a quip about something and tapped him in the back of the leg with my foot. \n\nHe paused for half a second then whipped around and threw his tea, cup and all, right into my face. Luckily, it was iced, so I didn't get burns or anything. \n\nI was honestly pretty angry. It got everywhere, and initially kinda hurt a little bit. I didn't say anything, I just stormed off and went back to his place to grab my shit and leave...\n\n\nWell he came in about five seconds behind me, having said nothing as well. I stood there and cried and asked why he hadn't just told me he was mad that I had jabbed him, and he apologized twenty times over. He said he didn't even register the anger at first, he just reacted, but he immediately regretted it afterwards. \n\nHere's where the AITA comes in: I told him that I wanted him to get therapy to work on his anger issues. I said that he was going to get help, or I was leaving. That if it happened again, I was leaving. And that was that. \n\nHe promised he would get help and that he felt terrible about it, and we laid down and talked for a little while longer, and now I'm home. \n\nTL:DR: My boyfriend has mentioned he can sometimes be irrationally angry. Figured it was sort of just \"teenage boy syndrome\" and shrugged it off. Tonight, he threw his cup of tea at me. I told him he either got professional help for it or I was leaving, and I'm absolutely going to hold him to it. My way or the highway - but I'll be the one hitting the road. \n\nAm I being too pushy? I've never handled this kind of thing before. Is there a better way I should've gone about it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling her boyfriend to get therapy or she'll leave after he threw iced tea at her.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend lashed out physically by throwing a cup of tea at her. Even though it was iced and maybe not physically injurious, it's still an act of aggression. The author had previously warned herself he had anger issues, so she had some awareness but didn't see red flags yet. Now, after this incident, she's setting a boundary.\n\nShe gives him an ultimatum: therapy or she leaves. The question is if that's too pushy. From a relationship standpoint, setting boundaries about abusive behavior is important. Violence or aggression, even if not severe, is a big red flag. The fact that he apologized and said he didn't mean to react that way might indicate he's aware but not in control. The author is protecting herself by demanding accountability.\n\nSome might argue that she's being too harsh, but considering the incident and his own admission of anger issues, her stance is reasonable. She's not just reacting to this one incident but also considering the pattern he mentioned. Therapy is a constructive step, not just a punishment. She's prioritizing her safety and emotional well-being, which is valid. So, the answer is B (No, she's not in the wrong).\n"
