We really just clicked in the very beginning and he's talked about how comfortable and safe he feels with me, and I honestly (even now) feel the same. \n\nNow, he's mentioned that he can get pretty irrationally angry about stuff, but I used to be one angry motherfucker about literally anything and everything, so I didn't really mind, so long as nothing came of it. \nI'm not saying I'm fail-proof, but I honestly hadn't gotten any red flags for the violent / abusive type. We were just two teenagers enjoying each other's company. \n\nWell, tonight I got a glimpse of what he actually meant when he mentioned his anger issues. \n\nWe were walking back to his place after getting dinner and some iced tea; we each had our own cups, they were just your regular plastic cups so nothing too...hard. \n\nHe was walking in front of me and I made a quip about something and tapped him in the back of the leg with my foot. \n\nHe paused for half a second then whipped around and threw his tea, cup and all, right into my face. Luckily, it was iced, so I didn't get burns or anything. \n\nI was honestly pretty angry. It got everywhere, and initially kinda hurt a little bit. I didn't say anything, I just stormed off and went back to his place to grab my shit and leave...\n\n\nWell he came in about five seconds behind me, having said nothing as well. I stood there and cried and asked why he hadn't just told me he was mad that I had jabbed him, and he apologized twenty times over. He said he didn't even register the anger at first, he just reacted, but he immediately regretted it afterwards. \n\nHere's where the AITA comes in: I told him that I wanted him to get therapy to work on his anger issues. I said that he was going to get help, or I was leaving. That if it happened again, I was leaving. And that was that. \n\nHe promised he would get help and that he felt terrible about it, and we laid down and talked for a little while longer, and now I'm home. \n\nTL:DR: My boyfriend has mentioned he can sometimes be irrationally angry. Figured it was sort of just \"teenage boy syndrome\" and shrugged it off. Tonight, he threw his cup of tea at me. I told him he either got professional help for it or I was leaving, and I'm absolutely going to hold him to it. My way or the highway - but I'll be the one hitting the road. \n\nAm I being too pushy? I've never handled this kind of thing before. Is there a better way I should've gone about it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling her boyfriend he needs to get therapy or she'll leave. The situation involves the boyfriend suddenly throwing a cup of iced tea in her face after a playful tap. \n\nFirst, the boyfriend had previously mentioned his anger issues, which the author was aware of. She thought it was manageable and part of being a teenager. When the incident happened, she felt violated and unsafe, leading her to set a clear boundary.\n\nSetting boundaries in a relationship is crucial. The author acted in self-defense by setting a firm limit, which is a healthy approach. The boyfriend's reaction\u2014throwing a cup\u2014was aggressive and unprovoked, crossing a social and personal boundary. The author's response to seek therapy is reasonable, as anger management issues, even if not violent, can indicate a need for professional help.\n\nThe key points here are the presence of prior warning signs (he mentioned anger issues), the immediate and unprovoked violent act, and the author's reasonable response to protect herself. The boyfriend's reaction was impulsive and harmful, which the author correctly identified as a red flag. Insisting on therapy is a proactive step to address the issue, not just a reaction to the incident.\n\nThere's no indication that the author overstepped. She didn't lash out or retaliate; she set a boundary and gave him a chance to change through therapy. The boyfriend's own acknowledgment of needing help and his apologies support the idea that the author's actions were justified.\n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong. Her actions were a responsible and necessary step to ensure her safety and the health of the relationship.\n"
