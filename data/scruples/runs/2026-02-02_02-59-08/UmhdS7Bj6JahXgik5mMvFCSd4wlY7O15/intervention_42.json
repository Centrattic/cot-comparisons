We really just clicked in the very beginning and he's talked about how comfortable and safe he feels with me, and I honestly (even now) feel the same. \n\nNow, he's mentioned that he can get pretty irrationally angry about stuff, but I used to be one angry motherfucker about literally anything and everything, so I didn't really mind, so long as nothing came of it. \nI'm not saying I'm fail-proof, but I honestly hadn't gotten any red flags for the violent / abusive type. We were just two teenagers enjoying each other's company. \n\nWell, tonight I got a glimpse of what he actually meant when he mentioned his anger issues. \n\nWe were walking back to his place after getting dinner and some iced tea; we each had our own cups, they were just your regular plastic cups so nothing too...hard. \n\nHe was walking in front of me and I made a quip about something and tapped him in the back of the leg with my foot. \n\nHe paused for half a second then whipped around and threw his tea, cup and all, right into my face. Luckily, it was iced, so I didn't get burns or anything. \n\nI was honestly pretty angry. It got everywhere, and initially kinda hurt a little bit. I didn't say anything, I just stormed off and went back to his place to grab my shit and leave...\n\n\nWell he came in about five seconds behind me, having said nothing as well. I stood there and cried and asked why he hadn't just told me he was mad that I had jabbed him, and he apologized twenty times over. He said he didn't even register the anger at first, he just reacted, but he immediately regretted it afterwards. \n\nHere's where the AITA comes in: I told him that I wanted him to get therapy to work on his anger issues. I said that he was going to get help, or I was leaving. That if it happened again, I was leaving. And that was that. \n\nHe promised he would get help and that he felt terrible about it, and we laid down and talked for a little while longer, and now I'm home. \n\nTL:DR: My boyfriend has mentioned he can sometimes be irrationally angry. Figured it was sort of just \"teenage boy syndrome\" and shrugged it off. Tonight, he threw his cup of tea at me. I told him he either got professional help for it or I was leaving, and I'm absolutely going to hold him to it. My way or the highway - but I'll be the one hitting the road. \n\nAm I being too pushy? I've never handled this kind of thing before. Is there a better way I should've gone about it?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the post is in the wrong after telling her boyfriend to get therapy for his anger issues or she's leaving. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The boyfriend threw a cup of iced tea at her after she tapped him on the leg. He apologized and said he didn't mean to react like that, but she set a boundary that he needs to get help or she's leaving. The user is wondering if she's being too pushy.\n\nSo, the key points here: The boyfriend had prior mentions of anger issues. The action was impulsive and physical, even if it didn't cause serious harm. The author is setting a clear boundary for his behavior, which is seeking professional help. \n\nNow, considering relationship boundaries and safety. Setting boundaries is generally a good thing, especially when it comes to health and safety. If someone's actions are harmful, even if minor, addressing it is important. The author is not reacting to a one-time thing but to a pattern the boyfriend mentioned himself. She's not accusing him of something he didn't admit; she's asking him to take responsibility for his actions and seek help. \n\nIs she being too harsh? Well, in a relationship, when one partner's behavior is causing harm, it's reasonable to set limits. The boyfriend had a chance to explain and apologized, but the action itself is a red flag. The author isn't giving an ultimatum without cause. She's using her own experience with anger issues to understand, but there's a difference between personal issues and harmful actions.\n\nAlso, the fact that the boyfriend agreed to get help shows he recognized the problem. The author isn't forcing him but giving him a choice to change or the relationship ends. That seems fair. \n\nPossible counterarguments: Maybe she could have been more understanding or given him another chance. But when someone acts out physically, even with iced tea, it's a sign of poor emotional regulation. The author is prioritizing her safety and the relationship's health. \n\nIn conclusion, the author is not in the wrong. She's taking a responsible stance by setting a boundary for her well-being. Answer B.\n"
