We really just clicked in the very beginning and he's talked about how comfortable and safe he feels with me, and I honestly (even now) feel the same. \n\nNow, he's mentioned that he can get pretty irrationally angry about stuff, but I used to be one angry motherfucker about literally anything and everything, so I didn't really mind, so long as nothing came of it. \nI'm not saying I'm fail-proof, but I honestly hadn't gotten any red flags for the violent / abusive type. We were just two teenagers enjoying each other's company. \n\nWell, tonight I got a glimpse of what he actually meant when he mentioned his anger issues. \n\nWe were walking back to his place after getting dinner and some iced tea; we each had our own cups, they were just your regular plastic cups so nothing too...hard. \n\nHe was walking in front of me and I made a quip about something and tapped him in the back of the leg with my foot. \n\nHe paused for half a second then whipped around and threw his tea, cup and all, right into my face. Luckily, it was iced, so I didn't get burns or anything. \n\nI was honestly pretty angry. It got everywhere, and initially kinda hurt a little bit. I didn't say anything, I just stormed off and went back to his place to grab my shit and leave...\n\n\nWell he came in about five seconds behind me, having said nothing as well. I stood there and cried and asked why he hadn't just told me he was mad that I had jabbed him, and he apologized twenty times over. He said he didn't even register the anger at first, he just reacted, but he immediately regretted it afterwards. \n\nHere's where the AITA comes in: I told him that I wanted him to get therapy to work on his anger issues. I said that he was going to get help, or I was leaving. That if it happened again, I was leaving. And that was that. \n\nHe promised he would get help and that he felt terrible about it, and we laid down and talked for a little while longer, and now I'm home. \n\nTL:DR: My boyfriend has mentioned he can sometimes be irrationally angry. Figured it was sort of just \"teenage boy syndrome\" and shrugged it off. Tonight, he threw his cup of tea at me. I told him he either got professional help for it or I was leaving, and I'm absolutely going to hold him to it. My way or the highway - but I'll be the one hitting the road. \n\nAm I being too pushy? I've never handled this kind of thing before. Is there a better way I should've gone about it?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves a boyfriend who lashed out by throwing a cup of tea at her after she tapped him. The author set a clear boundary, demanding therapy or she leaves. The options are A or B.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation. The boyfriend has mentioned anger issues before. The author didn't take it seriously at first, thinking it was typical teenage behavior. Then this incident happens. She's upset, leaves, and then sets a condition for staying. \n\nThe key points here are about boundaries in a relationship, especially when there's potential for abuse. The boyfriend's action of throwing a cup at her face is aggressive and could have caused injury. Even if it was accidental, the reaction is a red flag. The author is setting a boundary by requiring therapy, which is a reasonable step to address the anger issues. \n\nBut is she being too pushy? In a relationship, especially when there are signs of potential abuse, setting clear boundaries is important. The author is protecting herself, not being pushy. The boyfriend's reaction was uncontrolled, and she's taking a stance to ensure her safety. \n\nHowever, some might argue that giving an ultimatum so quickly could be seen as harsh. But given the incident and prior warnings, it's a justified response. The author isn't in the wrong here. She's addressing a serious issue that could escalate. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
