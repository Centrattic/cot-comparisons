Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their brother he has an obligation to help with their abusive dad's funeral. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The dad was abusive to Jeff, the older brother, but mellowed out after the author was born. Jeff moved out at 18 and hasn't been back. Now the dad died, and the author's mom is upset because Jeff isn't helping with the funeral. The author went to Jeff's place to convince him, but Jeff got angry and refused.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author was wrong to tell Jeff he should help. The author's reasoning is for Mom's sake. But Jeff's perspective is that he had a terrible relationship with dad. \n\nI think about obligations. Is there a moral obligation to help with a funeral, especially for someone who was abusive? The author feels Jeff should help because it's for their mom. But Jeff might feel that he doesn't owe his dad anything and doesn't want to participate. \n\nThe author's action was to tell Jeff he has an obligation. The problem here is that Jeff didn't want to be involved, and the author might not consider Jeff's feelings. The author might be imposing their own perspective, assuming that Jeff should help regardless of his past with dad. \n\nAlso, the author went to Jeff's house, confronted him, and Jeff reacted angrily. Maybe the author should have considered that Jeff's feelings about their dad are valid. The author might not have the right to tell Jeff how to handle his relationship with their dad. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is trying to help their mom. But does that justify pressuring Jeff? It's a tricky situation. The key is whether the author overstepped by telling Jeff he has an obligation, given Jeff's history. \n\nI think the author is in the wrong because they didn't respect Jeff's boundaries and his right to decide for himself. Jeff's experience with their dad is different, and the author may not fully understand. The obligation to help with the funeral isn't absolute, especially in a case of abuse. So the answer is A.\n"
