Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) question is in the wrong. The situation involves the author telling their older brother, Jeff, that he has an obligation to help with their abusive father's funeral. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The father was abusive towards Jeff, especially when he was drinking, before the author was born. Jeff left home at 18 and hasn't been in touch. The father later mellowed out, maybe due to sobriety. Now, the father has died, and the mother is upset because Jeff isn't helping with the funeral. The author went to Jeff's place to convince him, but Jeff reacted angrily, refusing to help. The author is now torn between their mom and Jeff.\n\nThe author's main question is whether they were wrong to tell Jeff that he should help. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants confirmation.\n\nI need to consider the ethical and emotional aspects here. On one side, the mother is grieving and wants support from all her children. The author might feel that it's a family obligation to be part of the funeral, even if the father was abusive. On the other side, Jeff has a valid reason not to participate, given the history of abuse. The author's approach might have been to pressure Jeff into something he's not emotionally ready for, possibly ignoring his past trauma.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the author's intention was to help the mom, which is understandable. But by asserting that Jeff \"has an obligation\" to help, the author might not be respecting Jeff's boundaries and his right to disengage from a relationship that was harmful. The author could have approached it with more empathy, understanding Jeff's perspective, and maybe suggested alternatives that work for both Jeff and the mom. Instead, the author framed it as an obligation, which Jeff took as a demand, leading to conflict.\n\nSo, while the author's intention was good, the method might have been flawed. The author might not be in the wrong in a legal or moral sense, but ethically, they could be considered wrong for not considering Jeff's feelings and boundaries. However, it's a complex situation where both parties have valid points. The key is whether the author had the right to push Jeff to participate despite his traumatic history. \n\nIn many cases, family obligations can be subjective. If the author had tried to mediate in a way that respects Jeff's choice, that would be better. But by telling Jeff he \"has an obligation,\" the author might be dismissing Jeff's legitimate reasons for not wanting to participate. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting Jeff's autonomy and for not approaching the situation with more sensitivity.\n"
