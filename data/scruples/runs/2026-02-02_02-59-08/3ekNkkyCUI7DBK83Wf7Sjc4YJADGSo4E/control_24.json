Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants to know if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for telling their brother Jeff he should help with their dad's funeral.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The dad was abusive to Jeff, especially when he was younger. Jeff left home early and hasn't been involved since. Now the dad died, and the mom is upset because Jeff isn't helping with the funeral. The author tried to convince Jeff, but Jeff reacted angrily and refused.\n\nSo, the author's argument is that they felt for Mom but also understood Jeff's perspective. They approached Jeff to help, but Jeff rejected it. The question is whether the author was wrong to push Jeff.\n\nI should consider family obligations. In some cultures, family members are expected to help with funerals regardless of past issues. However, if Jeff was a victim of abuse, maybe he's justified in not wanting to participate. The author might feel caught between Mom's needs and Jeff's feelings.\n\nThe author's intention was good\u2014to help Mom. But was it right to impose that obligation on Jeff, especially given the history? It's possible that Jeff has valid reasons not to help, and the author might not have considered that pushing Jeff was unfair. However, the author might also think that family duties are important despite past issues.\n\nAnother angle: the author's role as a mediator. Maybe they should have discussed with Mom first or found another way to handle Jeff's refusal without confronting him directly. Also, the author might have caused tension by not respecting Jeff's boundaries after the abuse.\n\nIn the end, it's a balance between respecting Jeff's feelings and supporting Mom. The author might not be wrong for trying to help Mom, but maybe they didn't fully respect Jeff's right to disengage. The answer could swing either way, but leaning towards B (not in the wrong) because the author had good intentions and Mom's emotional needs might take precedence, even if Jeff is resistant.\n"
