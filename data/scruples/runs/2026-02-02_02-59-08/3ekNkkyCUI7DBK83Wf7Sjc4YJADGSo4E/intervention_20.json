Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their brother he should help with their abusive dad's funeral. The situation involves a family with a history of abuse. The older brother, Jeff, suffered abuse from their dad and has cut ties. The author, the younger sibling, feels torn between their mom's distress and Jeff's valid reasons for not participating. \n\nFirst, the author was asked by their mom to convince Jeff to help. The author went over and told Jeff he has an obligation to help for their mom's sake. Jeff reacted angrily, feeling that the author doesn't understand his trauma.\n\nIs the author wrong for doing this? Well, the author's intention was to help their mom, which is understandable. However, they might not have considered Jeff's perspective deeply enough. Jeff has valid reasons for not wanting to participate, given the abuse. The author might have assumed that Jeff's obligation overrides his personal trauma, without fully acknowledging the severity of what Jeff went through. \n\nThe key here is whether the author respected Jeff's autonomy and feelings. By framing it as an obligation, the author might have been dismissive of Jeff's justified anger and trauma. It's possible that the author didn't realize that Jeff's refusal is a personal choice based on his past, not just stubbornness. \n\nSo, the author's action could be seen as well-meaning but misguided. They might have failed to empathize with Jeff's position. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because they didn't consider Jeff's trauma enough and imposed their own sense of obligation without understanding the deeper reasons behind Jeff's refusal.\n"
