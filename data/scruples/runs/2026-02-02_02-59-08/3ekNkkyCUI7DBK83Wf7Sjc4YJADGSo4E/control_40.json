Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for telling their brother he has an obligation to help with their dad's funeral. Let me break down the details.\n\nFirst, the dad was abusive towards Jeff when he was younger, but he mellowed out after the narrator was born. Jeff left home at 18, and the dad eventually got sober. Now the dad has died, and the mother is upset because Jeff isn't helping with the funeral. The narrator went to Jeff's house to convince him to help, but Jeff was angry and refused.\n\nSo the question is, did the narrator do the wrong thing by pushing Jeff to help? Let's consider both sides. On one hand, the mother is grieving and wants family support. The narrator might feel responsible to help her by getting Jeff involved. On the other hand, Jeff has valid reasons not to help because of the abuse he endured. The narrator might not fully understand Jeff's trauma, leading to a clash.\n\nIs it wrong to ask Jeff to help despite his past trauma? Maybe the narrator didn't consider Jeff's feelings enough. But they were trying to help their mom. It's a tough spot. The key points are the abuse Jeff experienced, the mother's emotional state, and the narrator's attempt to mediate. The narrator might not be in the wrong because they were trying to support their mom, but perhaps they could have approached Jeff more sensitively. However, the question is about being in the wrong, not about the best approach. Since Jeff has a legitimate reason to refuse, the narrator's insistence might be seen as pushing Jeff to relive his trauma. But the narrator's intention was to help their mom. It's a nuanced situation. Maybe the answer is that the narrator isn't in the wrong because they had a good intention, but they could have handled it better. However, the system wants a simple A or B. Let me think again. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because they were trying to help their mom, even if the approach could be better. Alternatively, maybe A because they didn't respect Jeff's boundaries. Hmm. I'm leaning towards B because the narrator's intention was to support their mom, and while their approach might have been flawed, they aren't necessarily in the wrong. Jeff's refusal is understandable, but the narrator's action of trying to convince him isn't inherently wrong.\n"
