Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The dad was abusive to the older brother, Jeff, especially when he was drinking. After the narrator was born, the dad mellowed out, possibly due to sobriety. Jeff left home at 18 and hasn't been involved much since. Now, the dad died, and the mom is upset because Jeff isn't helping with the funeral. The narrator went to Jeff to convince him, but Jeff got angry and refused. The author is questioning if they were wrong to tell Jeff he should help.\n\nSo, the key points here. The author tried to mediate between their mom and Jeff. They approached Jeff to get him to help with the funeral for Mom's sake. Jeff had a lot of negative experiences with their dad, which is understandable. The author might feel caught between supporting their mom and understanding Jeff's stance.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the author's intention was good\u2014to help their mom by getting Jeff involved. But Jeff's refusal is based on past trauma. The author might not fully appreciate the depth of Jeff's feelings. However, the author didn't force Jeff; they just asked him to help. The problem is whether imposing an obligation on Jeff was right.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, it's about whether the action was wrong. The author's action was to tell Jeff he should help, which Jeff felt was invalidating his experiences. But maybe the author overstepped by implying obligation rather than respecting Jeff's choice. Alternatively, the author was trying to support their mom, which is a valid concern.\n\nI think the author's position is a bit in the middle. They might have a point in wanting to support their mom, but they didn't consider Jeff's perspective enough. However, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They tried to mediate, and while Jeff's response was harsh, the author's intent was to help their family. The wrong here might be more on Jeff's refusal to help, but the question is about the author. So maybe the answer is B, not in the wrong. But I need to be careful. The author's approach could have been better, but is it wrong? It's a gray area. Maybe the answer is B, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me check again. The author's action was to tell Jeff he has an obligation, which Jeff might feel is unfair given his history. The author might not have considered that Jeff's choice not to participate is valid. So, in that sense, the author might have been wrong to push for obligation. Hmm. Alternatively, the author wasn't forcing Jeff to do anything, just suggesting he should. But maybe they misjudged the situation. I think the answer is A, the author is in the wrong for not respecting Jeff's boundaries. Or B, they are not in the wrong because they were trying to help their mom. It's tricky. The key is whether the author had the right to tell Jeff it's an obligation. Since Jeff has his own reasons, the author might have overstepped. So maybe A.\n"
