Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about their dad's funeral. The dad was abusive to the older brother, Jeff, but mellowed out when the author was born. Now that the dad is dead, the author and their mom want Jeff to help with the funeral, but Jeff refuses. The author went to talk to Jeff and told him he has an obligation to help for Mom's sake, which Jeff took badly.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. Is Jeff morally obligated to help with the funeral of someone who was abusive to him? On one hand, the mom is upset and needs support. On the other, Jeff has a history of being abused by his father, which is a traumatic experience. The author is trying to mediate between their mom and Jeff, but maybe they overstepped.\n\nThe author's intention was to help Mom, but they also acknowledge understanding Jeff's perspective. However, when they told Jeff he \"needs to contribute,\" they might not have considered Jeff's emotional boundaries. It's possible that the author assumed Jeff should put aside his past for the family, but that's not always feasible, especially after abuse. The obligation to attend a funeral can be a personal choice, not a legal one. So, is the author wrong for pressuring Jeff? \n\nAlso, the way the author approached it\u2014telling Jeff he's being a \" dick\"\u2014might have been confrontational. Maybe a more empathetic approach would have worked better. But the author was trying to help Mom, so their motivation was good. However, they might not have considered Jeff's right to disengage from something that brings up trauma. \n\nSo, weighing these factors, the author might not be in the wrong for trying to help Mom, but perhaps they could have handled it differently. But the question is whether they are in the wrong for telling Jeff he has an obligation. If the obligation is more about family expectations rather than a moral duty, then the author might not be in the wrong. However, if Jeff's refusal is a valid response to his trauma, then the author's insistence might be misplaced. \n\nI think the answer is B\u2014No, the author is not in the wrong. They were trying to support their mom, and while their approach might not have been perfect, they weren't wrong in asking Jeff to consider helping. The obligation here is more about the family dynamic rather than a strict moral obligation. However, there's a gray area because Jeff's trauma is real. But the question is about being in the wrong, and the author's actions were from a place of trying to help, so they might not be in the wrong.\n"
