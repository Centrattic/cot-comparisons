Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves their brother, Jeff, who was abused by their dad and now refuses to help with the funeral. The author went to Jeff's place to convince him to help their mom, but Jeff got angry and refused.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The dad was abusive, especially to Jeff when he was a teenager. After the author was born, the dad mellowed out, maybe because he got sober. Jeff left home at 18 and hasn't returned. Now, the dad has died, and the author is trying to get Jeff to help with the funeral, which Jeff refuses because of the past abuse. The author is caught between supporting their mom and understanding Jeff's feelings.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for insisting Jeff help. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to decide based on the situation.\n\nSo, the main factors here are the right to refuse involvement in a funeral due to past trauma and the obligation to family. Jeff was abused, so his refusal might be a valid emotional response. The author's mom is upset because Jeff isn't helping, but the author is acting in her interest. However, the author might not have considered that Jeff's trauma is legitimate and that pushing him could be harmful.\n\nIn situations involving abuse, the victim's choices are often more about their well-being than obligation. If Jeff has chosen to cut ties, especially after the abuse, it's his right. The author, perhaps not fully understanding the depth of Jeff's trauma, may have overstepped by pressuring him. The author's intention was to help the mom, but they might not have considered that the mom should handle this with Jeff directly or that the author shouldn't mediate if Jeff's refusal is justified.\n\nOn the other hand, the author could argue that family obligations are important, and the mom is suffering. But given that Jeff has a history of abuse and possibly a justified resentment, the author might have been wrong to insist he help, especially if it caused conflict.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be A (Author is in the wrong) because they didn't respect Jeff's boundaries and trauma, even if their intention was good. The author didn't consider that Jeff might have a valid reason to refuse, and their approach could have been insensitive.\n"
