Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their brother he should help with their dad's funeral, despite the abuse. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The dad was abusive towards Jeff, especially when he was drinking. The author wasn't around for that as much, maybe because he was born later and the dad got sober. Jeff moved out at 18 and hasn't been involved. Now, the dad died, and the author's mom is upset that Jeff isn't helping with the funeral. The author tried to convince Jeff, but Jeff got angry and refused.\n\nSo, the author's argument is that Jeff should help for their mom's sake. Jeff's side is that he was abused and doesn't want to be part of the funeral. \n\nI need to consider if the author has a right to push Jeff. Family obligations can be tricky. On one hand, the author is trying to support their mom during a tough time. On the other hand, Jeff has valid reasons for not wanting to participate due to past trauma. \n\nIs it fair to pressure someone with a history of abuse to participate in a funeral? The author might not fully understand Jeff's trauma. But the author is also trying to be supportive of their mom. \n\nThe key points are: the dad's abuse, Jeff's refusal due to his experiences, and the author's attempt to mediate. The author isn't in the wrong for trying to help their mom, but maybe they should have considered Jeff's feelings more. However, they might not be in the wrong because they were acting out of concern for the mother.\n\nI think the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They were trying to mediate a family matter and support their mom, even though they might not have fully grasped Jeff's trauma. But they didn't force Jeff beyond talking to him, and their intentions were to help the mother.\n"
