Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for telling their brother he needs to help with their dad's funeral. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The dad was abusive, especially to Jeff. He mellowed out after the author was born, maybe because he got sober. Jeff left home early, and now the dad has died. The mom is upset because Jeff isn't helping with the funeral. The author went to Jeff's place to convince him, but Jeff got angry, called the author names, and refused to help. The author is wondering if they were wrong to push Jeff.\n\nSo, the key points here are the history of abuse, the author's perspective, and Jeff's reaction. The author's intention was to help Mom by getting Jeff to participate. But Jeff has valid reasons not to help because of the abuse. The author might not fully understand Jeff's trauma. \n\nThe question is about whether the author was wrong. On one hand, the author was trying to support Mom by including Jeff. On the other hand, the author didn't consider Jeff's feelings and past experiences. Maybe the author should have respected Jeff's choice not to participate. The author might have forced Jeff into a situation where he's uncomfortable, which could be wrong.\n\nBut then again, the author was only trying to help their mom. However, the author might not realize that Jeff's refusal is justified. The author's approach might have been too direct and not empathetic enough towards Jeff's trauma.\n\nIn terms of obligations, is there a duty to help with a funeral? That depends on family dynamics and personal feelings. If Jeff has no emotional connection to the dad, he might not feel obligated. The author imposing this obligation might be misplaced.\n\nSo, the author's actions were well-intentioned but perhaps they misunderstood Jeff's position. They might have been wrong to insist that Jeff has an obligation without understanding the history of abuse. Therefore, the answer might be A (author is in the wrong) because they didn't consider Jeff's valid reasons and pushed him despite his trauma. Alternatively, if the author was trying to help the mom, maybe it's a grey area. But given the context, the author's lack of empathy towards Jeff's past could make them in the wrong.\n"
