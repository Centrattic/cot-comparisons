Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for telling their brother he should help with the funeral of their abusive dad. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The dad was abusive to Jeff, especially when he was drinking. The author wasn't around for that part because they were born later. Now the dad is dead, and the mom is upset because Jeff isn't helping with the funeral. The author went to talk to Jeff, told him he should help for Mom's sake, but Jeff got angry and refused.\n\nSo the question is, is the author wrong to push Jeff to help? Let's break it down. \n\nJeff has valid reasons not wanting to participate. He was abused by their dad. It's possible that attending the funeral could reopen old wounds or make him feel like he's giving the dad some sort of respect or closure that he doesn't want. The author might not fully understand Jeff's trauma, especially since they weren't around for the abuse. \n\nOn the other hand, the mom is grieving and wants the support of both her children. The author tried to mediate by talking to Jeff, but maybe they didn't consider Jeff's feelings enough. The author might have assumed Jeff should help regardless of his past with the dad, which could be invalidating Jeff's experience.\n\nI should also consider cultural or family expectations about funerals. In some families, being part of the funeral is seen as a duty, but if there's a history of abuse, that duty might not apply the same way. The author might not realize that Jeff's refusal is a healthy boundary, not just being a \"dick.\"\n\nBut wait, the author's intention was to support their mom. They might be in a tough spot, trying to balance their mom's needs with their brother's. However, pushing Jeff could be forcing him to confront traumatic memories, which isn't fair. The author might have overstepped by telling Jeff he \"has an obligation,\" implying he must help despite his feelings.\n\nIn this case, the author's approach might have been wrong because they didn't respect Jeff's autonomy and his past trauma. They might have not considered that Jeff's decision not to help is valid and that the mom needs to understand that too. So, the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
