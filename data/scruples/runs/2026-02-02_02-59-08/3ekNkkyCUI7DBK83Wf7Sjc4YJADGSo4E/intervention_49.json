Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about whether the author was right to tell their brother he should help with their abusive dad's funeral.\n\nFirst, the dad was abusive to the brother, Jeff, when he was younger. The author wasn't around for that because they came later, so they didn't experience the abuse. Jeff moved out at 18 and hasn't been in contact, which is understandable given the dad's behavior. Now the dad died, and the mom is upset because Jeff isn't helping with funeral plans. The author tried to convince Jeff to help, leading to an argument where Jeff was angry and refused to participate. The author is now wondering if they were wrong to pressure Jeff.\n\nSo the key points here: Did the author have the right to tell Jeff he had an obligation to help with the funeral? The author's mom wants Jeff involved, but Jeff has a history of abuse from the dad. Is it fair to expect someone who was abused by their parent to participate in the funeral? \n\nOn one hand, the author is trying to support their mom, which is a valid concern. Families often want to keep things together, especially for the deceased. But on the other hand, Jeff has legitimate reasons to cut ties. If the dad was abusive, maybe Jeff's refusal is a way to protect his mental health and distance himself from the source of his trauma. The author might not fully understand Jeff's feelings since they weren't part of the abusive dynamic. \n\nThe author's approach was to tell Jeff he \"has an obligation,\" which might sound like they're imposing without considering Jeff's perspective. The obligation part is debatable. Do family members owe each other to participate in funerals, especially when there's a history of abuse? It's possible that the author didn't consider that Jeff might not feel any obligation, given the negative relationship with his dad. \n\nAlso, the way the author approached it\u2014telling Jeff he's making their mom sad and that he's being a \"dick\"\u2014might have been confrontational. That could have escalated the situation. Maybe a more empathetic approach would have been better, but the author's intention was to help their mom. \n\nSo, the author's actions were well-meaning, but maybe they didn't take into account the depth of Jeff's trauma and the fact that Jeff might not want any part in the funeral. The obligation angle could be the issue here. Families can have different expectations, but when abuse is involved, the surviving family member might feel justified in cutting ties. The author might not be in the wrong for trying to mediate, but they might be wrong in assuming Jeff has an obligation to participate. \n\nIt's a bit of a grey area. The author's concern for the mom is valid, but they might have overstepped by pressuring Jeff. The answer might depend on whether you think Jeff should be obligated to help despite the abuse. If the obligation is based on family duty regardless of past trauma, then maybe the author is not in the wrong. But if Jeff's mental health and past experiences mean he doesn't owe that help, then the author might be in the wrong for not respecting Jeff's boundaries.\n"
