Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for telling their brother he should help with their dad's funeral. The dad was abusive, especially to the older brother, Jeff. The author's mom wants Jeff to help with the funeral arrangements, but Jeff refuses, saying he won't help the \"asshole\" who was abusive.\n\nSo, the author went to Jeff's house to convince him, but Jeff got angry. The author is now torn between their mom's feelings and Jeff's justified anger. The key points here are the dad's abuse history, Jeff's experience with it, and the author's attempt to mediate between mom and Jeff.\n\nFirst, the author's intention was to help their mom by getting Jeff involved. But Jeff's refusal is based on past trauma. The author might not fully understand Jeff's pain because they weren't subjected to the abuse in the same way. However, it's understandable that the author wants to ease their mom's distress.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, family obligations can be complex. The author isn't wrong for wanting their mom to have support, but they might have overstepped by implying Jeff has an obligation he doesn't feel he has. Jeff's refusal is a personal choice based on his history. The author's approach was to tell Jeff he \"needs\" to contribute, which could be seen as not respecting Jeff's boundaries. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's concern for their mom is valid. The question is whether the author's actions were wrong. Since the author acted with good intentions but didn't consider Jeff's perspective fully, maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong), but there's room for gray. However, the key is that the author tried to mediate but Jeff's refusal is justified. So the author isn't necessarily in the wrong, but maybe could have handled it differently.\n"
