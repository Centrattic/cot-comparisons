Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their brother he needs to help with their father's funeral. The situation involves an abusive father who improved after the author was born, but the older brother, Jeff, had a really bad experience with him. Now that the dad has died, the author's mom is upset because Jeff isn't helping with the funeral. The author went to Jeff to convince him, but Jeff got angry and refused.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The father was abusive towards Jeff, which is a serious issue. Jeff moved out early and hasn't reconciled, which makes sense given the trauma. The author, who had a better relationship with the dad, feels Jeff should help for Mom's sake. But Jeff's refusal is understandable due to his past.\n\nThe author's intention was to support their mom, which is valid. But maybe they didn't consider Jeff's perspective enough. Was it right to push Jeff to participate in a funeral for someone who was abusive to him? The author might not realize the emotional impact on Jeff. Also, the author told Jeff he has an obligation, which Jeff might see as invalidating his trauma.\n\nOn the other hand, the mom is hurting, and the author wants to help her. But maybe there's a way to support the mom without forcing Jeff. The author might have overstepped by implying Jeff has an obligation, not considering his right to disengage from the abusive father's funeral.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a tough call. They had good intentions, but perhaps they didn't respect Jeff's boundaries enough. The answer might be A, but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe the obligation part is where the mistake was.\n"
