Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their brother he should help with their dad's funeral despite the abuse.\n\nFirst, the dad was abusive to Jeff, especially when drunk. Jeff moved out at 18 and hasn't been part of the family since. The author, who wasn't subjected to the same abuse, feels Jeff should help with the funeral for their mom's sake. But Jeff is upset and refuses, feeling the author doesn't understand his trauma.\n\nThe key points here are the author's perspective versus Jeff's. The author is in a middle ground between mom and Jeff. They tried to convince Jeff, but Jeff is holding onto past trauma. The author's intention was to help their mom, but maybe they didn't consider the emotional impact on Jeff enough. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? They might have overstepped by implying an obligation. Jeff has valid reasons to not participate. The author might not fully grasp the depth of Jeff's pain. But they were trying to help their mom, which is understandable. \n\nSo, it's a bit of a gray area. However, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting Jeff's boundaries, especially if Jeff made it clear he didn't want to be involved. The author should have maybe found another way to support their mom without pressuring Jeff.\n"
