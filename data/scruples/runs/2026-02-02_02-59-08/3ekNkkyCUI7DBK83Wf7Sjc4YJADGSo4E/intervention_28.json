Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is at fault for telling their brother he should help with their dad's funeral. The dad was abusive, specifically towards the older brother, Jeff. The author tried to convince Jeff to help their mom with the funeral arrangements, but Jeff got angry and refused.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The dad was abusive when Jeff was younger, which is a significant factor. The author didn't experience that abuse directly, so they might not fully understand Jeff's feelings. The author's intention was to help their mom, which is understandable. However, the key issue here is whether the author overstepped by demanding that Jeff help, especially given the history of abuse.\n\nIn many cases, family members who were victims of abuse have the right to set boundaries, even after the abuser's death. The author's message that Jeff \"has an obligation\" might not take into account Jeff's trauma and his decision to cut ties. The author might be projecting their own feelings about the dad (who mellowed out later) onto Jeff's situation. \n\nAdditionally, the author went to Jeff's house to confront him, which could be seen as intrusive. The way Jeff reacted shows he's hurt and resistant, possibly from past trauma. The author might not have considered that Jeff's refusal is a valid response to his own experiences, not just being a \"dick\" as the author put it. \n\nSo, while the author's intent was to support their mom, they might have failed to consider Jeff's perspective and boundaries. The obligation to help with a funeral isn't absolute, especially in cases of abuse. The author's approach could have been more empathetic and less confrontational. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting Jeff's autonomy and emotional state.\n"
