Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a family conflict regarding a funeral. The dad was abusive to the older brother, Jeff, but mellowed out after the younger sibling was born. Now that the dad has died, the mom is upset because Jeff isn't helping with the funeral. The author went to Jeff's house to tell him he should help for Mom's sake, and Jeff reacted angrily.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics. The author is trying to mediate between Mom and Jeff. The author's intention was to help Mom, who is grieving and upset. Jeff, on the other hand, has a history of abuse from their dad and is understandably reluctant to participate in the funeral. The author's approach was to tell Jeff he \"has an obligation\" to help. \n\nBut here's the thing: obligation can be a loaded term. Jeff might not feel he owes their dad anything, especially given the abuse. The author might not have considered Jeff's feelings or the reasons behind his refusal. Instead of understanding Jeff's perspective, the author framed it as Jeff being a \"dick\" and needing to stop being one. That could come off as dismissive of Jeff's trauma.\n\nThen there's the part where the author says they went to Jeff's house to \"convince him to be a part of the funeral.\" Convincing implies that Jeff's participation is necessary, but maybe the author should have respected Jeff's boundaries. The author might not have acknowledged that Jeff has the right to decide not to participate due to his past experiences with their dad.\n\nHowever, the author is also trying to support their mom, which is a valid concern. The mom is upset, and the author is caught in the middle. The key issue is whether the author had the right to pressure Jeff, given his traumatic history with their father. The author might not be in the wrong for wanting to help Mom, but their approach might have been flawed by not considering Jeff's perspective and emotions.\n\nIn terms of obligation, family responsibilities can be complex. If Jeff has cut off contact for a reason, especially related to abuse, it's reasonable for him not to participate. The author's message might have been more about duty rather than empathy. The author should have perhaps focused on Mom's feelings without making Jeff feel forced into an obligation he doesn't feel he has.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The author's intention was to help their mom, which is understandable, but their approach might have been inconsiderate of Jeff's past trauma. The author might not be in the wrong entirely, but their method of confrontation could be seen as insensitive. However, since they were trying to mediate and didn't force Jeff beyond a confrontation, maybe they aren't in the wrong. Alternatively, if pushing obligation is problematic, then maybe they are. \n\nHmm. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer depends on whether the author overstepped by not acknowledging Jeff's reasons and asserting obligation. I think the author isn't entirely in the wrong because they were trying to help Mom, but they could have handled it better. However, in terms of being in the wrong, maybe not. The answer would be B for No.\n"
