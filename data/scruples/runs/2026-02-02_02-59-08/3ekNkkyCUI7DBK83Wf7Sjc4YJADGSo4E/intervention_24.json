Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their brother he needs to help with their dad's funeral. The situation is that their dad was abusive to the brother but mellowed out when the author was born. The brother left when he was 18, and now the author is trying to get him to help with the funeral to support their mom, but the brother refuses.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the family dynamics. The dad was abusive to Jeff, so Jeff has a history of trauma. The author isn't directly affected in the same way, since the dad mellowed when they were born. The author's mom is upset because Jeff isn't helping, and the author tried to convince Jeff to help, which led to an argument.\n\nThe key points here are the author's intention and the brother's response. The author's motivation was to help their mom by getting Jeff involved, which is understandable. But Jeff's refusal is rooted in his past abuse, which is valid. So, is the author wrong to have approached Jeff? Well, the author was following their mom's request to ask Jeff to help. The author's action was to mediate between the mom and the brother. However, the author might have assumed that Jeff had an obligation, not considering that Jeff might not feel responsible due to his past. \n\nBut wait, the author did acknowledge that they understand why Jeff is upset. So maybe the author didn't fully respect Jeff's boundaries. The question is, does the author have the right to push Jeff to participate in a funeral for someone who was abusive to him? The author's argument is that it's for Mom's sake. But Jeff might feel that attending the funeral would be retraumatizing or not want to honor someone who was abusive. \n\nIn this case, the author might have overstepped by framing Jeff's refusal as being inconsiderate (\"needs to stop being such a dick to mom\") rather than understanding Jeff's perspective. The author's approach might have been judgmental, leading to the conflict. So, while the author's intent was to help, the execution might have been wrong by not respecting Jeff's autonomy and feelings. \n\nOn the other hand, the author was trying to support their mom, which is a family obligation. But the brother's right to decide his own level of involvement in the funeral for someone who abused him is also important. Therefore, the author's mistake might be in assuming Jeff's obligation without considering his trauma and boundaries. Hence, the author could be in the wrong for not approaching the situation with more empathy and understanding towards Jeff's past.\n"
