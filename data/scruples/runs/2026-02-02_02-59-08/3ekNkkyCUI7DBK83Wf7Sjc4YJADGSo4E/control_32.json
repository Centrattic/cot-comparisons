Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about their dad's funeral. The author's brother, Jeff, was abused by their dad when he was younger. Now that their dad is dead, the author is trying to get Jeff to help with the funeral because their mom is upset he's not involved. The author went to Jeff's house and told him he has an obligation to help for Mom's sake. Jeff got angry and refused.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author's dad was abusive to Jeff, but not so much to the author. Jeff left when he turned 18, and hasn't looked back. Now, the dad is dead, and the author is trying to reconcile Jeff's refusal to participate in the funeral with their mom's emotional state. \n\nThe author's main argument is that Jeff should help with the funeral for Mom's sake. But Jeff's response was that he doesn't want to honor the person who abused him. From Jeff's perspective, maybe he feels that helping with the funeral would be like condoning the abuse or honoring someone who caused him and his mom so much pain. The author might not fully grasp the trauma Jeff went through, especially since he wasn't there for Jeff's experiences.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is trying to support their mom by involving Jeff. They might feel that Jeff, as a brother, should have some responsibility here. But does that obligation extend to someone who was a victim of abuse? Maybe not. It's possible that Jeff's refusal is a healthy boundary after experiencing abuse. The author might be assuming that Jeff should put aside past trauma for the family's sake, but that could be unfair. \n\nThe key points here are: 1) Did the author overstep by pressuring Jeff to participate in something that might be triggering or against his will? 2) Is Jeff obligated to help with the funeral despite his past? 3) How does the mother's feelings factor into this?\n\nThe author's intention was good\u2014trying to help their mom. But maybe they didn't consider Jeff's trauma. The author might not be in the wrong because they were acting out of concern for their mom, but maybe they could have handled it differently. However, telling Jeff he \"has an obligation\" might be the wrong approach, especially if Jeff's trauma is valid. \n\nIn terms of ethics, people have the right to set boundaries, especially after abuse. The author might have a point in wanting unity, but forcing someone to participate in a funeral against their will could be harmful. The author could be in the wrong if they didn't respect Jeff's autonomy to decide for himself. But if the author was just trying to mediate and didn't force anything, maybe not. Wait, the author said Jeff refused and got angry. The author didn't force him, just told him he should help. However, the author might not have considered that Jeff's refusal is legitimate. \n\nSo, the answer could be A (the author is in the wrong) because they didn't consider Jeff's valid reasons and instead imposed an obligation. Alternatively, B (not in the wrong) if they were just trying to help their mom. But I think the key here is that the author didn't account for Jeff's trauma and the abuse. So, the answer is A.\n"
