Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their older brother Jeff that he has an obligation to help with their abusive dad's funeral. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The dad was abusive when Jeff was younger, but became mellow after the author was born. Jeff moved out at 18 and hasn't been in contact. Now the dad died, and the mom is upset because Jeff isn't helping with the funeral. The author went to Jeff and told him he should help for Mom's sake, but Jeff got angry and refused.\n\nSo, the key points here: the dad was abusive to Jeff, which is a serious issue. Jeff has a valid reason to be upset and not want to participate. The author is trying to mediate between Mom and Jeff. The question is whether the author is wrong to ask Jeff to help.\n\nI need to consider family obligations. Some might say that family should support each other even in death, but others argue that you shouldn't be forced to participate in events related to someone who was abusive. The author's intention was to help Mom, but Jeff's refusal is rooted in his past trauma. \n\nIs it the author's fault for pushing Jeff? The author might not have considered Jeff's feelings. However, they were trying to help their mother. But maybe they should have respected Jeff's boundaries. The line between helping a parent and respecting a sibling's trauma is blurry here.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's not a clear-cut yes or no. But the options are A (yes, wrong) or B (no, not wrong). The author's perspective is that they tried to get Jeff to help for Mom's sake, which is understandable, but they didn't consider Jeff's emotional state. However, the author might not be wrong because they were trying to support their mother. But if the author knew Jeff's history, maybe they should have been more sensitive. \n\nAlternatively, Jeff's refusal is his right, and the author shouldn't have forced him to participate. The answer might depend on the cultural context or family expectations. But in the context of the question, the options are A or B. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because they were trying to help their mother. Jeff's refusal is his choice, but the author's intention was to mediate. However, maybe the author should have respected Jeff's decision without pushing. But the question is about being \"in the wrong.\" Since the author didn't force Jeff to participate but asked him to consider Mom, perhaps they're not wrong. But if they insisted despite Jeff's past abuse, maybe they are. Hmm. This is a tough call. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), because the author was trying to reconcile family, but maybe A if pushing Jeff was wrong. The community's take on AITA posts often considers the intent and the trauma involved. Since Jeff was abused, the author might have been wrong to push him. So maybe A. Wait, but the author's mom is upset. It's a balance. Maybe the answer is B because the author acted out of concern for Mom and didn't know how to handle it, but not necessarily in the wrong. I'm a bit split. \n\nAlternatively, if you have a history of abuse, you don't have an obligation to participate in a funeral. So the author's insistence might be wrong. So A. But the answer depends on the reasoning. The user is asking for a binary answer. I'll go with B (No) because the author's intent was to help the mother, and while the approach might have been flawed, they aren't in the wrong. However, if the answer is A, that would mean the author was wrong to push Jeff despite his history. Given the context, maybe A is correct. I'm conflicted. Let me see examples. In similar AITA situations, if someone is asked to participate in a funeral for an abusive parent, the consensus is that they have the right to refuse. So the author's mistake was not respecting Jeff's decision. Therefore, the author is in the wrong. So answer A.\n"
