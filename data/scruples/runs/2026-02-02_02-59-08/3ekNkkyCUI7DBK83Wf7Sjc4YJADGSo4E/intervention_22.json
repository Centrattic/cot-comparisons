Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for telling their brother he should help with their abusive dad's funeral.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The brother, Jeff, had a really bad experience with their dad\u2014abuse, yelling, etc. The author, who was younger, didn't experience that same treatment. Now, their dad died, and the mom is upset because Jeff isn't helping with the funeral. The author went to Jeff's place to convince him, but Jeff got angry and refused, even calling the author out for not understanding his pain.\n\nThe key points here are the author's actions and the relationships involved. The author's intention was to help their mom by getting Jeff to contribute, but Jeff has valid reasons for not wanting to participate due to past abuse. The author might be in a position where they feel they have to choose sides, but is their action justified?\n\nThe question is whether the author was wrong to push Jeff. On one hand, the author was trying to support their mom. On the other, Jeff's trauma and refusal to participate in the funeral of someone who hurt him are valid. The author might not fully grasp Jeff's feelings, given they weren't subjected to the same treatment. Telling Jeff he has an obligation could be seen as invalidating his past experiences and current boundaries.\n\nSo, the author's mistake might be in assuming that Jeff should help despite his history with their dad. The obligation argument might not consider Jeff's emotional state and his right to set boundaries. The author might not be in the wrong entirely, but there's a case to be made that they didn't respect Jeff's feelings and trauma, leading to a conflict.\n\nUltimately, the answer depends on whether the author should have respected Jeff's decision not to participate, even if it upset their mom. If the author was in overstepping by imposing an obligation without understanding the depth of Jeff's trauma, then the author is in the wrong. Hence, the answer might be A (Yes, in the wrong).\n"
