Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their older brother he should help with their abusive father's funeral.\n\nFirst, the brother, Jeff, had a really bad childhood with their dad. The dad was abusive when he was drinking, which Jeff experienced firsthand. The author, on the other hand, was born later when the dad mellowed out and wasn't around much after leaving home at 18. Now the dad has died, and the author and mom want Jeff to help with the funeral, but he's refusing.\n\nThe author went to Jeff to convince him, which led to an argument. Jeff got angry, accused the author of not understanding his pain, and refused to help. The author is now caught between wanting to support mom and understanding Jeff's perspective.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, the author's intent was to help their mom by trying to get Jeff involved. But Jeff has a history of trauma with their dad. The author might not fully grasp how hurtful the dad was to Jeff, given their different experiences. However, the author is trying to mediate the family situation. \n\nBut is pushing Jeff to participate in the funeral, despite his traumatic past, a wrong move? It could be argued that the author didn't consider Jeff's emotional state and trauma. The author might have a good intention but didn't account for Jeff's feelings. On the other hand, the mom is upset, so the author is trying to help. \n\nI think the key here is whether the author should have respected Jeff's boundaries. The author's actions could be seen as overstepping because Jeff has a right to his feelings about the father. The author might not be in the wrong in terms of intent, but in the execution, maybe they were wrong to push Jeff to participate in something that's painful for him. So the answer might be B (Not in the wrong) because the author had good intentions and tried to mediate, but there's a nuance where the author might not have considered Jeff's trauma enough. Alternatively, maybe A (in the wrong) if the author should have respected Jeff's decision not to help. Hmm. I need to decide based on the context. The author's action was to get Jeff to help for mom's sake, but it's possible the author didn't consider Jeff's trauma. However, the author's side of the story shows they do understand Jeff's perspective to some extent. The author might not be in the wrong. So I think the answer is B.\n"
