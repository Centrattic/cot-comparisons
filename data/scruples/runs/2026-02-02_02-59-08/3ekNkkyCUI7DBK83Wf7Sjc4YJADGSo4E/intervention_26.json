Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their brother he should help with their dad's funeral. The situation involves a dad who was abusive, especially to the older brother Jeff. The author tried to convince Jeff to help with the funeral for their mom's sake, but Jeff got angry and refused.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The dad was abusive to Jeff, which Jeff probably still feels strongly about. The author, who wasn't as affected by the abuse, is now pushing Jeff to help with the funeral. The mom is upset because Jeff isn't helping. The author went to Jeff's house and told him he should help for Mom's sake, which led to a confrontation.\n\nNow, considering the ethics here. Was the author wrong to pressure Jeff? Jeff has valid reasons not to participate due to the abuse. The author's intention was to support their mom, which is understandable. But does that mean Jeff is obligated to help despite his traumatic experiences?\n\nThe author might be in the right if their intention was good, to support their mom. But they might also be in the wrong if they didn't consider Jeff's feelings and history. The question is about obligation. Does Jeff have a moral duty to help with the funeral even if he doesn't want to? Maybe not, especially if it causes him emotional distress.\n\nThe author's role is tricky. They are trying to mediate between their mom and brother. But telling Jeff he \"has an obligation\" might be imposing their own perspective without understanding Jeff's trauma. The author should have considered that Jeff's refusal is a valid response to his past and that their mom might need to accept that.\n\nSo, the author's mistake might be in assuming Jeff must help, not respecting his boundaries, and not providing alternative solutions for their mom. However, their intention was to help Mom, which isn't wrong. But the approach might be wrong. Therefore, the answer could be AITA, meaning the author is in the wrong because they didn't respect Jeff's autonomy and history. Alternatively, they might not be in the wrong if they were trying to support their mom, but the line is thin.\n\nI think the author is in the right because they were trying to help their mom, but maybe the way they approached Jeff was wrong. However, the core question is whether the author is in the wrong for telling Jeff he must help. Since Jeff has legitimate reasons to refuse, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting his decision. But their intention was good. Hmm. It's a bit of a gray area. However, since the author forced their perspective without considering Jeff's valid reasons, the answer might be that they are in the wrong.\n"
