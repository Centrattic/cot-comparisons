Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the AITA post) is in the wrong for telling their brother Jeff that he has an obligation to help with their dad's funeral.\n\nFirst, let me recap the situation. The dad was abusive towards Jeff and the mom, especially when he was drinking. Jeff moved out at 18 and hasn't been back. After the dad died, the author went to Jeff to convince him to help with the funeral. Jeff got angry and refused, leading to a conflict. The author is torn between their mom's needs and understanding Jeff's trauma.\n\nNow, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author is in the wrong. Let me consider the perspectives.\n\nFrom the author's side: They wanted to support their mom by getting Jeff involved. They might believe that despite past issues, Jeff has a responsibility as a brother. They might not see the trauma Jeff experienced and feel that Jeff should put aside the past for the family.\n\nFrom Jeff's perspective: He suffered abuse from their dad. The trauma is real, and he might feel that participating in the funeral would be retraumatizing. He might have valid reasons to not want to engage with the dad's legacy.\n\nThe author's approach was to tell Jeff he has an obligation. That could come off as dismissive of Jeff's feelings and trauma. Instead of being empathetic, the author framed it as a duty, which might have triggered Jeff's anger. The author might not have considered that Jeff's refusal is rooted in personal history and not just being a \"dick,\" as Jeff put it.\n\nAlso, the author's mother is upset because Jeff isn't helping. The author is caught between mom and Jeff. But the key point is whether the author had the right to impose an obligation on Jeff, especially without understanding his trauma.\n\nIn terms of ethics, respecting someone's trauma and boundaries is important. The author might be in the wrong for not acknowledging Jeff's pain and instead pushing for his participation without empathy. The approach was confrontational, stating \"you have an obligation,\" which could be seen as invalidating Jeff's experiences.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's intention was to help their mom, which is understandable. However, the method might have been flawed. A better approach could be to understand Jeff's reasons, validate his feelings, and maybe find a compromise that doesn't force him into participation.\n\nSo, considering the context, the author's message might have been hurtful and dismissive. Therefore, the answer might be that the author is in the wrong.\n"
