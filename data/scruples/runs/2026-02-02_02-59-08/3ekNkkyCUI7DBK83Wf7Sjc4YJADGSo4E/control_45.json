Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for telling their brother he should help with their dad's funeral. The situation is complicated because the dad was abusive, especially to Jeff, the older brother. The author, the younger sibling, went to Jeff to convince him to help with the funeral, and Jeff reacted angrily, refusing to participate. Now the author is wondering if they did the wrong thing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The dad was abusive towards Jeff, which is a serious issue. Jeff moved out as soon as he could and hasn't looked back, which makes sense given the abuse. The author's mom is upset because Jeff isn't helping with the funeral, and the author tried to mediate, but Jeff is resistant. \n\nThe author's intention was to help their mom by getting Jeff involved. But Jeff has legitimate reasons to be upset and not want to participate in a funeral for someone who abused him. The author might not fully understand Jeff's trauma. \n\nIs it the author's fault? Well, they were trying to help their mom, which is understandable. But they might not have considered Jeff's feelings enough. However, given that the author knows about the abuse, maybe they still had a right to ask Jeff to help for the mom's sake. But maybe they should have respected Jeff's decision to distance himself from the dad. \n\nThe key points here are family obligations versus personal trauma. The author might feel they're in the right because they're trying to support their mom, but Jeff's refusal is justified given his past. The author might be in the right if they approached it with good intentions, but they could have been more sensitive. However, the question is about whether they're in the wrong. \n\nIn similar situations, people often argue that you can't force someone to participate in a funeral for someone who wronged them. The author's approach might have been well-meaning, but Jeff's response indicates that he's not willing to help. So, maybe the author isn't in the wrong for trying to mediate, but they might have underestimated Jeff's trauma. However, the answer depends on whether their actions were justified. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), because the author was trying to help their mom, and while Jeff's refusal is understandable, the author isn't necessarily wrong for attempting to bridge the gap. However, they should have been more cautious in their approach. The main issue is the author's intention versus Jeff's right to refuse. So, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
