Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is at fault for telling their older brother he should help with their abusive dad's funeral. The author's brother, Jeff, experienced abuse from their dad when he was younger, which stopped after the author was born. The dad died, and the author's mom is upset because Jeff isn't helping with the funeral. The author went to Jeff and told him he should help for Mom's sake, but Jeff reacted angrily and refused.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The dad was abusive to Jeff, so Jeff might have valid reasons to not want to participate in the funeral. The author is trying to mediate between Jeff and their mom, but Jeff's reaction was hostile. The author is now conflicted between supporting their mom and understanding Jeff's stance.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key points are the author's right to intervene, the nature of the request, and the ethical considerations of pressuring someone to participate in a funeral for someone who abused them. \n\nOn one hand, the author is trying to help their mom, which is a family obligation. On the other hand, Jeff has a history of trauma and might not feel responsible to help. The author might not have considered that Jeff's refusal is rooted in past abuse, not just being a \"dick,\" as Jeff put it.\n\nThe author's message to Jeff was about obligation, which Jeff might find invalidating. The author might have been in the wrong if they didn't consider Jeff's perspective and trauma. However, the author's intention was to support their mom, which is also valid. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the author should have respected Jeff's boundaries instead of imposing an obligation. Since Jeff's trauma is significant, the author might have been wrong to push him for participation without understanding his reasons. So the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
