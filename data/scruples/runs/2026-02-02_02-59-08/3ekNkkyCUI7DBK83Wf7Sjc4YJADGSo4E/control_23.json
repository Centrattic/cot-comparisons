Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me.

My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral.

Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for telling their older brother Jeff to help with their abusive dad's funeral. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the dad was abusive to Jeff when he was younger, but after the author was born, he mellowed out, possibly because he got sober. The author and their mom are handling the funeral arrangements, and Jeff is refusing to help. The author went to Jeff's house to convince him, but Jeff reacted angrily, calling the author an idiot and refusing to help. Now the author is unsure if they did the right thing by approaching Jeff like that.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author was wrong to tell Jeff he has an obligation to help. Let's think about the key points here. The dad was abusive to Jeff, so Jeff might have a legitimate reason to feel resentful. The author, who wasn't subjected to the same abuse, is asking Jeff to help with the funeral. The author's mom is upset because Jeff isn't participating. The author's intention was to support their mom, but Jeff's response was hostile.\n\nEthically, family obligations can be tricky. On one hand, the author feels that Jeff should contribute for their mom's sake, as she was also a victim of the abuse. On the other hand, Jeff might feel that the abuse he endured is a reason to distance himself from any remembrance of their dad. The author's approach was to tell Jeff he has an obligation, which could come across as guilt-tripping, especially if Jeff has unresolved trauma. \n\nThe author's argument is that Jeff's obligation is for their mom. But Jeff might believe that he has no obligation to a man who abused him. The author might not fully understand the depth of Jeff's pain, having experienced a different side of their dad. The author's intervention could be seen as overstepping if they didn't consider Jeff's feelings and reasons for not wanting to participate. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's not a simple yes or no. The author's intention was to support their mom and find a compromise. However, imposing an obligation on someone who has a history of abuse might not be the best approach. It's important to respect Jeff's boundaries and his right to decide whether he wants to be involved in the funeral. The author might not be in the wrong for trying to mediate, but they could have handled it more sensitively. Instead of framing it as an obligation, maybe discussing it with empathy and understanding would have been better. \n\nSo, considering all that, is the author in the wrong? It depends on the approach. If the author acknowledged Jeff's past and offered support rather than demanding help, maybe they wouldn't be. But since they told Jeff he has an obligation, which could be seen as pressuring him, the answer might be A (Yes). However, the author's concern for their mom is valid. Maybe the right answer is B (No) because they were trying to help their mom, even if the method was flawed. But I'm a bit torn here. Let me re-read the scenario to make sure.\n\nThe author said Jeff is making their mom super upset and that he needs to stop being a dick. That's pretty harsh. Obligating Jeff to help might be the problem. The author might not have considered that Jeff's refusal is a personal choice due to his trauma. So, the author's action was well-intentioned but perhaps insensitively phrased. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for not respecting Jeff's feelings and boundaries, and possibly for using a confrontational approach.\n"
