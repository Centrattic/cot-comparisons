Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for telling their older brother he needs to help with their abusive dad's funeral.\n\nFirst, the context: The dad was abusive towards Jeff when he was younger, but after the narrator was born, he mellowed out. Jeff left home at 18, hasn't been in contact much. Now the dad died, and the mom is upset because Jeff isn't helping with funeral arrangements. The narrator went to Jeff's house to convince him, but Jeff was angry, called him an idiot, and refused to help. The narrator is conflicted between their mom and understanding Jeff's perspective.\n\nSo, the question is whether the narrator is in the wrong. Let's consider the key points. \n\nThe narrator's mom is grieving and wants support from both kids. The narrator tried to mediate, which could be seen as trying to help the mother. However, the dad was abusive to Jeff, which is a valid reason for Jeff not wanting to participate. The narrator might not have considered Jeff's trauma and pushed him to help, which could be seen as insensitive. \n\nOn the other hand, the narrator isn't wrong for wanting to support their mom and trying to reach out. They might not have considered Jeff's feelings, but their intention was to help the family. \n\nBut is that enough to say they're in the wrong? Or is it a matter of understanding both sides? The narrator didn't force Jeff, they went to talk and were met with anger. The issue is whether it's fair to expect Jeff to help given his history. \n\nLegally and morally, there's no obligation to attend a family funeral unless specified by the family, but in family dynamics, there's often an expectation. However, given the abuse, Jeff's refusal might be justified. The narrator might have overstepped by implying Jeff had an obligation, not considering his trauma. \n\nBut then again, the narrator was trying to bridge the gap between their mom and Jeff. It's a complex situation where both sides have valid points. The narrator isn't in the wrong for trying to mediate, but maybe they could have approached it differently. \n\nIn terms of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) context, the community often looks at intent and context. The narrator's intent was to help their mom, which is understandable. Jeff's refusal is based on past trauma. The narrator isn't necessarily at fault here. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but it's a close call. However, some might argue that pushing someone with trauma to participate in a funeral related to the source of their trauma is insensitive, making the narrator at least partially wrong. \n\nBut the key here is that the narrator didn't force Jeff; they just asked him to help for Mom's sake. Since Jeff is an adult and his decision is his to make, the narrator isn't wrong for trying to communicate their mom's feelings. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
