Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their older brother, Jeff, that he has an obligation to help with their abusive dad's funeral. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the background: Jeff experienced abuse from their father when he was younger. The dad mellowed out later, maybe after the author was born. Mom is upset because Jeff isn't helping with the funeral arrangements. The author went to Jeff to convince him to help for Mom's sake, but Jeff got angry and refused. The author is now questioning if they did the wrong thing.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether the author was right to push Jeff to help with the funeral despite his past trauma. From what I understand, the author's intention was to help Mom by getting Jeff involved. But Jeff's reaction suggests that the author might not have considered the emotional impact of the request.\n\nI need to think about the ethics here. Obligations can be complex, especially with family. If someone has a history of abuse, expecting them to participate in a funeral for the abuser could be seen as adding to their trauma. The author might not have fully grasped Jeff's feelings or the depth of his trauma, hence the conflict.\n\nOn the other hand, the author was trying to support their mom, which is a valid concern. However, the way the author approached it\u2014telling Jeff he \"has an obligation\"\u2014might have been insensitive. It's possible the author didn't acknowledge Jeff's valid reasons for not wanting to participate. \n\nSo, considering that Jeff has a right to set boundaries based on his experiences, the author might have overstepped by framing it as an obligation rather than understanding Jeff's perspective. The author could have been more empathetic and explored other ways to support Mom without involving Jeff if he's not willing. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting Jeff's boundaries and for not considering the emotional toll.\n"
