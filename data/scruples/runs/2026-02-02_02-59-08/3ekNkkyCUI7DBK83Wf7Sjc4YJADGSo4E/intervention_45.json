Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who posted the situation is in the wrong for telling their older brother he should help with the funeral of their abusive dad.\n\nFirst, the brother, Jeff, was abused by their dad when he was younger. The author wasn't around during that time, so they probably didn't experience the same abuse. The mom is upset because Jeff isn't helping with the funeral, and the author went to talk to Jeff, urging him to help for their mom's sake. But Jeff reacted angrily, saying he won't help because of the abuse he endured.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? The author's intention was to support their mom, which is understandable. However, they might have overlooked Jeff's valid reasons for not wanting to participate. The author might not fully grasp the emotional trauma Jeff went through. By pressuring Jeff, they could be invalidating his feelings. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is trying to mediate between their mom and Jeff. They might not have malicious intent. But is it right to push someone to participate in a funeral for someone who was abusive to them? Maybe the author should have approached it differently, respecting Jeff's boundaries while still trying to support their mom. \n\nIt's a tough spot. The author's actions were likely well-meaning but might have been misguided. They might be in the right in wanting to help their mom, but maybe they didn't consider Jeff's perspective enough. So, depending on the balance between these factors, the answer could be either way. However, since Jeff's trauma is a significant factor, the author might be in the right because they were trying to help their mom, but also in the wrong for not respecting Jeff's feelings. Hmm, this is tricky. Maybe the answer leans towards not in the wrong (B), as the author's intentions were good even if the outcome wasn't ideal.\n"
