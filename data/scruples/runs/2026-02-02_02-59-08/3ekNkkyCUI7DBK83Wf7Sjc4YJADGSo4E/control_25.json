Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their brother he has an obligation to help with their dad's funeral. The situation involves abuse from their father, Jeff being the older brother who left when he turned 18, and now the author tried to convince Jeff to help with the funeral because their mom is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The dad was abusive towards Jeff, and Jeff has no contact since he was 18. The author, who was born later, didn't experience the same abuse. Now the author is pushing Jeff to help with the funeral, which Jeff refuses, leading to conflict.\n\nThe author's main point is that Jeff has an obligation for Mom's sake. But Jeff's perspective is valid\u2014he's dealing with trauma from the abuse. The author might not fully understand Jeff's feelings since they weren't there for those experiences. \n\nThe key here is whether the author had the right to tell Jeff that he \"has an obligation.\" Obligations can be complex in family dynamics, especially when there's a history of abuse. Jeff's refusal could be a result of his trauma and a need to distance himself from his father's legacy. The author might be trying to protect their mom's feelings but isn't considering Jeff's emotional state.\n\nHowever, the author's intention was to help their mom, which is understandable. But forcing someone to participate in a funeral for their abuser might not be fair. The author might not have considered that Jeff's refusal is a form of self-care or protecting his mom by not perpetuating the cycle of abuse.\n\nSo, the author's argument that Jeff \"has an obligation\" might be the wrong approach. The author should have perhaps supported Jeff's decision and found another way to help their mom without pressuring Jeff. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for not respecting Jeff's boundaries and his past experiences.\n"
