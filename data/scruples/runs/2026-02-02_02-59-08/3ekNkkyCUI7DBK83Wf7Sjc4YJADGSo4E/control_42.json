Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for telling their brother he has an obligation to help with their abusive dad's funeral.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The brother, Jeff, had a bad relationship with their dad. He was abused, and the dad was an alcoholic. The author, who is the younger sibling, didn't experience the same abuse. Now, the dad has died, and the author is trying to get Jeff to help with the funeral to make their mom feel better. Jeff is resistant and angry, so the author confronted him, which led to a conflict.\n\nThe key points here are the family dynamics and the nature of the obligation. The author believes Jeff should help because of their mom's feelings. Jeff, however, has a history of abuse and doesn't want to honor a person who was abusive. The question is whether the author is wrong to push Jeff to participate despite his reasons.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, family obligations can be complex. The author's intention was to support their mom, which is understandable. However, Jeff's trauma and refusal to engage with their dad's legacy is also valid. Pressing Jeff to help might invalidate his feelings and past experiences. The author might not have considered that Jeff's refusal is a personal boundary, not just a lack of empathy. \n\nThe author might be in the wrong if they didn't respect Jeff's emotional needs and boundaries. Everyone has the right to decide how they handle their relationship with a deceased parent, especially one who was abusive. The author's approach could be seen as imposing their own perspective without considering Jeff's trauma. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is trying to help their mom, which is a noble intent. But the method of confrontation and asserting obligation might be misguided. The author didn't force Jeff, but the way they phrased it (\"needs to contribute\") could feel coercive. \n\nSo, considering both sides, the author's actions might be well-meaning but not respecting Jeff's autonomy. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they didn't account for Jeff's justified reasons and possibly forced an emotional burden on him.\n"
