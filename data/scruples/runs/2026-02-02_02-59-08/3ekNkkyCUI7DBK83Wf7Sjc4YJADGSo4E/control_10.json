Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the story is at fault for telling their brother he should help with the funeral of their abusive dad.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The brother, Jeff, had a bad experience with their dad, who was abusive when he was younger. The author, the other sibling, didn't experience the same abuse. The dad died, and now the mom is upset because Jeff isn't helping with the funeral. The author went to Jeff to convince him, but Jeff got angry and refused.\n\nThe key points here are the history of abuse, the author's intent to help the mom, and Jeff's right to refuse. The author's actions were motivated by wanting to support their mom, but they didn't consider Jeff's perspective. However, Jeff's refusal is understandable given his past trauma. The question is whether the author was wrong to push Jeff to help despite his negative feelings towards their dad.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the author isn't wrong for wanting to help their mom. However, they might have overstepped by not respecting Jeff's boundaries. The author's intention was good, but they didn't account for Jeff's trauma. It's a balance between family obligations and personal trauma. The author's mistake was not considering Jeff's feelings and past, leading to conflict.\n\nSo, the answer is B (No). The author isn't in the wrong because they acted out of concern for their mom, but they could have handled it more sensitively. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong at all. Since their intent was to support their mother, and they didn't force Jeff, it's more about a communication issue rather than being in the wrong. Jeff's refusal is valid, but the author's approach could be improved. Still, the answer leans towards B.\n"
