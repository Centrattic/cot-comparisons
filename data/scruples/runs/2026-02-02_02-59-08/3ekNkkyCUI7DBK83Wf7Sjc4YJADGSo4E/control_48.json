Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author's dad was abusive to their older brother, Jeff, but mellowed out after the author was born. Now that the dad is dead, the author's mom is upset because Jeff isn't helping with the funeral. The author went to Jeff to convince him, but Jeff got angry and refused. The author is asking if they were wrong to pressure Jeff.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The dad was abusive to Jeff, which is a serious issue. Jeff moved out as soon as he could, which makes sense given the abuse. The author, on the other hand, was treated better, maybe because the dad got sober after they were born. So the author's perspective might not fully understand Jeff's trauma.\n\nWhen the author told Jeff he had an obligation to help with the funeral, maybe they didn't consider that Jeff might not want to participate because of the abuse. Obligation could mean different things. The mom might feel it's important for the family to come together, but Jeff's experience with the dad is different. \n\nThe author's intention was to help their mom, which is understandable. But was it wrong to pressure Jeff, who has a history of abuse? Maybe the author didn't realize that Jeff might not want to engage with the dad's funeral at all. The author might have assumed that since the dad mellowed with them, Jeff should also have some responsibility. But Jeff's trauma could make any participation painful.\n\nAlso, the author didn't tell their mom what happened, which could lead to more issues. But the main question is whether the author was wrong to approach Jeff that way. The key points are the history of abuse and the author's understanding of it. If the author didn't fully grasp the depth of Jeff's pain, then maybe they were wrong to push him. On the other hand, the author was trying to support their mom, which is a valid concern too.\n\nIn situations where there's a history of abuse, people often have different boundaries. Forcing someone to participate in a funeral could be triggering or retraumatizing. The author might not have considered that Jeff's refusal is a boundary he needs to set. So maybe the author is wrong for not respecting Jeff's possible need to distance himself from the dad's funeral. \n\nOn the flip side, the author might think that family obligations are important, especially for the mom's sake. However, the abuse aspect complicates that. The author should have perhaps approached Jeff with more empathy, explaining the mom's feelings without framing it as an obligation. Instead, they told Jeff he \"needs\" to contribute, which might not be the right approach when there's unresolved trauma.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't consider Jeff's trauma and his right to set boundaries, even if it's difficult for their mom. The answer is probably A (Yes), but I need to make sure there's no nuance I'm missing. Alternatively, if the author's intention was good and they just didn't realize the depth of Jeff's feelings, maybe it's not entirely their fault. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since they pushed for an obligation without considering Jeff's trauma, I think the answer is A.\n"
