Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person (the author) is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation carefully.\n\nThe author has an older brother, Jeff, who had a really bad experience with their dad. The dad was abusive when Jeff was younger, but after the author was born, he mellowed out. Now the dad died, and the author and mom are planning the funeral. Jeff isn't helping and is being upset. The author went to Jeff's house to tell him he should help because it's making mom sad. Jeff got angry and refused to help. The author is now wondering if they were wrong to ask Jeff to help.\n\nFirst, I should consider the dynamics here. Jeff was abused by their dad, and he's clearly still hurt. The author understands that but also wants to support their mom. The author's intention was to get Jeff to help, which is for their mom's emotional well-being. \n\nIs the author obligated to make Jeff help? Well, Jeff isn't under any legal obligation to attend or help, but maybe there's a family expectation. The author's mom is upset because Jeff isn't contributing. The author decided to confront Jeff, which led to a confrontation. \n\nOn one hand, the author is trying to support their mom and maybe thinking that family should come together, even for a funeral. On the other hand, Jeff has valid reasons to be upset and might not want to participate in any way that honors the abusive father. The author might not fully appreciate the depth of Jeff's trauma.\n\nBut was the author wrong to ask? They didn't force Jeff or threaten him; they just expressed their mother's feelings and tried to convince him. It's a family matter, and different people handle things differently. The author might not be in the wrong because they were trying to mediate the situation. However, they might not have considered Jeff's feelings enough. But since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, it's about whether they overstepped.\n\nIn some cases, people might feel that the author should have respected Jeff's decision not to participate, given the history. But others might think the author was right to try to reconcile the family for the mother's sake. So it's a bit of a toss-up. But I think the answer leans towards B (not in the wrong) because the author's intention was to help their mom, even if the approach could be seen as a bit heavy-handed. However, the author could have handled it more sensitively, but that doesn't make them wrong. The key is whether they had the right to ask Jeff, and since family obligations can be subjective, the author isn't necessarily wrong.\n"
