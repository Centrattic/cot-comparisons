Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their brother he should help with the funeral of their abusive dad. \n\nFirst, the context: the dad was abusive towards Jeff, the older brother, but mellowed out after the author was born. Jeff moved out at 18 and hasn't been in contact. Now, the dad died, and the mom is upset because Jeff isn't helping with the funeral. The author went to Jeff and told him he should contribute for Mom's sake. Jeff reacted angrily, saying he won't help because of the abuse.\n\nThe author is caught between Mom and Jeff. They tried to mediate by asking Jeff to help, but Jeff refused. The question is whether the author is at fault.\n\nLooking at the situation, the author might be in the right because they tried to support their mom, who's grieving. It's reasonable to want family to come together, even if there's past issues. However, Jeff's trauma from the abuse is valid, and the author might have overstepped by insisting he help despite his feelings. The obligation to help might be culturally or family-based, but the author didn't consider Jeff's perspective enough. They might have forced a choice between two difficult sides without fully understanding Jeff's refusal. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's intention was to help their mom, which is understandable. They might not have realized the depth of Jeff's trauma. But the author's approach could be seen as pressuring Jeff, which might not be fair given the history. So there's a balance here.\n\nIn the end, the author might not be in the wrong because they were trying to support their mom, but they could have handled it differently. However, the answer depends on whether the obligation to help the funeral is fair given Jeff's history. If the author pushed without considering Jeff's valid reasons, they might be partly at fault. But since the user thinks the author is in the wrong, maybe the answer is A. But I need to decide based on the reasoning.\n"
