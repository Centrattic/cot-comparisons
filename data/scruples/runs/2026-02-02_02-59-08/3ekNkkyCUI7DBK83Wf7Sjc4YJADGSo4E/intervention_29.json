Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their brother Jeff that he has an obligation to help with their dad's funeral. The dad was abusive towards Jeff when he was younger, which is a big part of why Jeff doesn't want to participate now.\n\nFirst, the author's mom is upset because Jeff isn't helping. The author tried to mediate, but Jeff got angry and refused. Now the author is torn between supporting their mom and understanding Jeff's perspective. \n\nThe key points here are the obligation Jeff might feel. The author assumed Jeff should help, but Jeff's trauma and anger from past abuse probably make that a non-starter. The author might not have considered Jeff's feelings enough. They went over to confront him, which might have been too direct. Also, the author didn't tell the mom what happened, maybe to avoid conflict, but that could lead to more issues later.\n\nThe author's intention was to help their mom, which is understandable, but they didn't consider Jeff's valid reasons for not participating. Obligation isn't always clear-cut in family situations, especially with abuse. So, the author might have been wrong to push Jeff into helping without respecting his boundaries.\n"
