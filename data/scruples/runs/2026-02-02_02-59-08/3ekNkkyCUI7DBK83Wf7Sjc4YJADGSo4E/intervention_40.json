Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their brother he has an obligation to help with their dad's funeral. The situation is that their dad was abusive, especially to Jeff, the older brother. Jeff moved out when he was 18, and now the dad has died. The author's mom is upset because Jeff isn't helping with the funeral. The author went to Jeff's place to convince him, but Jeff got angry and refused.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the moral obligation here. The author believes Jeff should help because of their mom's sake. But Jeff has a history of abuse. The key points are: Jeff was abused, which might make it hard for him to participate in a funeral for someone who hurt him. The author might not fully understand Jeff's trauma. Also, the author's mom is struggling, but does that mean Jeff is obligated to help if he doesn't want to?\n\nThe author's intention was to help their mom, but maybe they didn't consider Jeff's feelings or history. The author's comment about Jeff being a \" dick\" for not helping might not take into account the emotional impact of the abuse. The author is caught between their mom and Jeff, but pushing Jeff to participate might be invalidating his experiences.\n\nOn the other hand, the author isn't wrong for trying to help their mom. However, the approach could be seen as insensitive. The author might not have realized that Jeff's refusal is a valid response to past trauma. So, the author's mistake is in assuming Jeff has an obligation without considering his perspective and history. Therefore, the author is partially in the wrong for not respecting Jeff's boundaries and past experiences.\n"
