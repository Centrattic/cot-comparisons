Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The situation is about a family conflict regarding a funeral. The main question is whether the author (the younger sibling) is in the wrong for telling their older brother, Jeff, that he has an obligation to help with their abusive father's funeral.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The father was abusive towards Jeff and the mother, especially when he was drinking. Jeff left home when he was 18, got sober after the author was born, and the author didn't experience the same level of abuse. Now, the father has died, and Jeff refuses to help with the funeral, which is causing their mom distress. The author tried to convince Jeff to help but was met with anger and refusal.\n\nThe author's action was to tell Jeff he has an obligation to help. The key here is whether the author overstepped or not. The author's intention was to help their mom, but they might not have considered Jeff's feelings and experiences. The author might not fully understand the trauma Jeff went through, especially since they weren't around for the worst parts.\n\nIs it wrong to ask a brother to participate in a funeral for their parent, even if the parent was abusive? That's a tricky question. On one hand, family obligations can be strong, and the mother is suffering. On the other hand, Jeff has valid reasons not to want to be involved with someone who was abusive to him. The author might not have considered the emotional impact of their words on Jeff.\n\nThe author's message to Jeff was framed as an obligation, which could come across as dismissive of Jeff's past. The author might not have given Jeff enough agency to make his own decision without pressure. They might have assumed that their perspective (that the father had a redemption arc with the author) was the only valid one, not considering the lasting trauma on Jeff.\n\nAdditionally, the author's approach led to conflict. Jeff reacted strongly, which suggests that the author's approach wasn't sensitive. The author's role as a mediator between their mom and Jeff might have been handled better by supporting Jeff's choice rather than demanding involvement.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting Jeff's boundaries and for not acknowledging the depth of Jeff's trauma. They might have acted out of a desire to help their mom but without considering the emotional complexities Jeff faces. Therefore, the answer would be A.\n"
