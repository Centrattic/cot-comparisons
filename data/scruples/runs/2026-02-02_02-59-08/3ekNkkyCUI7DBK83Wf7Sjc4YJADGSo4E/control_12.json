Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about whether their older brother, Jeff, should help with their dad's funeral. The author's dad was abusive to Jeff when he was younger, but became better after the author was born. Now that the dad is dead, the author is telling Jeff he has an obligation to help with the funeral. Jeff is refusing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's actions. They went to Jeff's house and told him he needs to help for their mom's sake. The author might think that because Jeff is their brother, he should help, especially since their mom is upset. However, Jeff has a valid reason not to help because of the abuse he suffered. The author might feel they're standing up for their mom, but Jeff has his own trauma.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author tried to convince Jeff, but Jeff is justified in his anger. The author might have assumed that Jeff should help regardless of past abuse. However, the author's intent was to help their mom, which is understandable. But forcing Jeff to participate in a funeral for someone who was abusive could be traumatic for him. The author didn't consider Jeff's emotional state and the fact that he might not want to engage with their dad's funeral at all.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's mom is suffering, and maybe the author feels they need to support her. But the author should have considered Jeff's perspective more. They might not realize that Jeff's refusal is a coping mechanism. The author's approach might have been too direct without showing empathy for Jeff's past. So, the author might not be entirely in the wrong, but they could have handled it more sensitively. However, the key point is whether they were wrong in asserting that Jeff has an obligation. Since Jeff has a legitimate reason to refuse, the author's expectation that Jeff should help might be misplaced. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting Jeff's decision and not understanding his trauma.\n"
