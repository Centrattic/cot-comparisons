Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for telling their brother he has an obligation to help with the funeral. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the dad was abusive towards Jeff, as he described. He was an alcoholic who hit Jeff and was verbally abusive. The author wasn't around when that happened because they were born later, so their experience with the dad was better. Jeff left home when he was 18, and hasn't been involved since. Now the dad died, and the mother is upset because Jeff isn't helping with the funeral. The author went to Jeff to ask him to help, but Jeff got angry and refused. The author is now wondering if they were wrong to push Jeff.\n\nSo the key points are: Jeff had a traumatic experience with their dad, which the author acknowledges. Jeff is in his right to not want to honor a person who was abusive to him. The author felt for their mom and wanted Jeff to help, but maybe imposing an \"obligation\" on Jeff without considering his feelings could be the issue here. The author might not realize that Jeff's trauma and resentment are valid reasons to not participate. \n\nThe question is whether the author overstepped by telling Jeff he had an obligation. Obligations can be cultural or familial, but if Jeff's experience was so negative, maybe the author shouldn't have framed it as an obligation. They might have considered Jeff's feelings more. The author might have approached it from the mom's perspective without understanding Jeff's trauma. So, the answer could be AITA (Am I the Asshole) but depends on the cultural context and the family dynamics.\n\nIn some cultures, family obligations are strong, but if Jeff was abused, forcing him to participate might be invalidating his trauma. The author might not have considered that Jeff's refusal is a healthy boundary. Therefore, the author could be in the wrong for not respecting Jeff's feelings and boundaries, pushing him to help despite his reasons not to. So the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
