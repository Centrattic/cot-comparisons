Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their brother Jeff he should help with their dad's funeral. The situation involves an abusive father, and Jeff's history of being abused by him. The author's mom wants Jeff to help with the funeral, but Jeff refuses, saying he won't help his dad's funeral because of the abuse.\n\nSo, the main question is: Was the author wrong to pressure Jeff into helping? Let me break this down. \n\nFirst, the context: Jeff endured abuse from their dad. The author didn't experience it as much, maybe because the dad mellowed after the author was born. Jeff moved out and cut ties. Now the dad is dead, and the mom is upset because Jeff isn't helping with the funeral. The author went to Jeff to convince him, but Jeff got angry and refused.\n\nThe author is in a middle between their mom and Jeff. The key points here are about obligation and family dynamics. The author's mom feels Jeff should help, but Jeff has a history of abuse and trauma. \n\nSo, is the author wrong? Well, the author's intention was to help their mom, which is understandable. However, Jeff has a right to not engage with his father's funeral if it's traumatic for him. The author might not have considered Jeff's feelings and trauma when asking. \n\nBut the author's mom is upset, so the author is trying to mediate. However, the way the author approached Jeff might have been insensitive, especially since Jeff has valid reasons for not wanting to participate. The author might have assumed Jeff should help more because of family obligation without considering Jeff's past.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's mom is grieving and wants closure, which is valid too. The author's action was to try to ease that. But the problem is that Jeff's trauma is real, and the author might not have the right to push Jeff into something he's not comfortable with. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author's actions were to help their mom, but they might not have respected Jeff's personal boundaries and trauma. So the author might be in the wrong for not considering Jeff's perspective first. Alternatively, the author isn't in the wrong because they were trying to support their mom. \n\nBut considering that Jeff has valid reasons, the author's approach might have been misguided. So the answer could be that the author isn't in the wrong, but maybe they should have considered Jeff's feelings more. However, the key is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nIf the author's action was to pressure Jeff to help despite his trauma, that could be seen as inconsiderate. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong (A). But if the author's intention was good and they were trying to help their mom, maybe they aren't (B). \n\nHmm. It's a bit of a gray area. I think the main point is that Jeff has a valid reason not to help, so the author's insistence might be wrong. But the author's mom needed support. But the author's action was to tell Jeff he has an obligation, which might not be fair. \n\nSo, the answer is likely B (not in the wrong) because the author was trying to mediate and help their mom, even if they didn't consider Jeff's feelings as much. But some might argue A. But the key is whether the author is in the wrong. Since Jeff's refusal is based on trauma, the author's push might be wrong, but the author's intention was to help mom. \n\nProbably, the answer is B. The author isn't in the wrong for trying to support their mom, even if they could have been more considerate. But the actual answer depends on the perspective. In the AITA context, sometimes the person is seen as not wrong if their intentions are good. So I'll go with B.\n"
