Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about whether their brother should help with their abusive father's funeral. The author went to their brother Jeff and told him he has an obligation to help, which led to a big argument. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The dad was abusive towards Jeff, especially when he was younger. He drank a lot and was violent. Jeff left home as soon as he could, and he's been cut off since. Now that the father is dead, their mom is upset because Jeff isn't helping with the funeral. The author tried to mediate and convince Jeff, but Jeff was angry and refused.\n\nSo the question is whether the author made a mistake by pressuring Jeff. On one hand, the mom is grieving and wants closure, and maybe expects both kids to help. The author might feel responsible for trying to support their mom. On the other hand, Jeff has valid reasons to be angry and not want any part in the funeral. The author's approach might have been too direct, making Jeff feel blamed instead of understanding his pain.\n\nThe author's intention was to help their mom, but they didn't consider Jeff's feelings. They told Jeff he \"has an obligation,\" which sounds like a demand rather than a request. Jeff might feel that the author is dismissing his past trauma. Instead of respecting Jeff's choice not to participate, the author tried to guilt-trip him. That could be where they went wrong.\n\nBut maybe the author didn't know how to approach it. They might not have realized that Jeff's trauma is so deep. Still, the act of pressuring someone who has a history of abuse to participate in a funeral might not be fair. The author might have assumed that Jeff should help for the mom's sake, but that could be another form of pressure on Jeff.\n\nIn the end, it's about empathy. The author might have been trying to help, but their method wasn't considerate of Jeff's feelings. So the answer is probably A, the author is in the wrong because they didn't respect Jeff's boundaries and instead of being supportive, they were confrontational.\n"
