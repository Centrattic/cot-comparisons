Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their brother he has an obligation to help with their dad's funeral, even though the dad was abusive.\n\nFirst, the context: The dad was abusive towards Jeff and their mom, especially when drinking. After the author was born, he mellowed out. Jeff left home at 18, and the dad later got sober. Now the dad died, and Jeff refuses to help with the funeral, causing mom distress. The author tried to convince Jeff but got yelled at and Jeff refused.\n\nThe author is caught between supporting mom and understanding Jeff's feelings. The main question is whether the author is in the wrong for pushing Jeff to help.\n\nSo, considering the situation: The author's intent was to help their mom by trying to get Jeff involved. However, Jeff has valid reasons for not wanting to participate due to past abuse. The author didn't force Jeff but spoke to him out of concern for mom. Jeff's refusal is his right given his past trauma. The author didn't know Jeff's stance beforehand and tried to mediate, which seems reasonable. However, maybe the author should have considered Jeff's feelings more before pushing. But given the mom's emotional state, the author's action is understandable. So, the answer might hinge on whether the author overstepped by implying obligation despite Jeff's history. However, the author's action seems well-meaning, even if the outcome wasn't what they hoped. So maybe B (not in the wrong) is the better choice.\n"
