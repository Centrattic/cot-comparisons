Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here.\n\nThe user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is at fault for telling their brother he needs to help with their dad's funeral. The situation involves abuse from their father, which primarily affected their older brother, Jeff. The author, who is younger, wasn't subjected to the same level of abuse because their father mellowed out after the author was born. \n\nSo, the key points here are the history of abuse, the brother's refusal to participate in the funeral due to his past, and the author's attempt to mediate between their mom and Jeff. The question is whether the author was wrong to push Jeff to help with the funeral despite Jeff's valid reasons for not wanting to.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspect. The author is trying to support their mother by encouraging reconciliation or at least participation from Jeff. But Jeff has legitimate reasons for not wanting to be involved, given the abuse he endured. The author might not fully understand the depth of Jeff's trauma, especially since he wasn't subjected to the same treatment. \n\nHowever, the author's intention is to help their mother, who is upset. The problem is that forcing Jeff to participate when he's emotionally unwilling could cause more harm. The author might be overstepping by implying that Jeff has an obligation to help, without considering Jeff's right to not engage with someone who caused him so much pain. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might not be aware of the extent of Jeff's trauma. But given that Jeff explicitly stated his reasons and the author still pushed, there's a case to be made that the author didn't respect Jeff's boundaries. The obligation to a parent's funeral isn't absolute, especially when there's a history of abuse. So, maybe the author is in the wrong for not respecting Jeff's decision, even if the intention was good.\n\nBut wait, the mother is the one who asked the author to talk to Jeff. So the author is trying to fulfill the mother's request. However, the mother's emotional state is also a factor here. The author is caught in the middle, but does that absolve them of responsibility? \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the author should have considered Jeff's perspective more. The author's message was that Jeff \"has an obligation\" to help, which might not be the right approach. Jeff has the right to choose not to participate. The author's role is to communicate the mother's feelings, but not to impose obligations without understanding the trauma. So, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting Jeff's autonomy and for not recognizing the validity of Jeff's reasons.\n"
