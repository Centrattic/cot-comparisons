Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about their older brother not helping with the funeral of their abusive dad.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the main points. The brother, Jeff, had a really bad childhood with their dad being abusive when he was younger. The author wasn't around for that as they were born later, so the dad mellowed out. Now that the dad is dead, the mom is upset because Jeff won't help with the funeral. The author went to Jeff's place to convince him, but Jeff got angry and refused.\n\nThe question is whether the author was wrong to push Jeff to help. The author's argument is for the mom's sake. Jeff's side is understandable because of the abuse. But the author is caught in the middle.\n\nNow, considering the options: A is yes, the author is in the wrong. B is no, they are not. \n\nThe author tried to mediate between their mom and Jeff. The issue is whether it's right to pressure Jeff to participate in a funeral for someone who was abusive. The author might have a point in wanting to support their mom, but Jeff has valid reasons for not wanting to help. However, the author might have overstepped by telling Jeff he has an obligation, especially considering the trauma Jeff experienced. \n\nObligations can be tricky. While family obligations are common, in cases of abuse, it's more complex. The author's approach might have been too direct without considering Jeff's feelings. Maybe a softer approach or understanding Jeff's perspective more fully would have been better. \n\nBut the author's intention was to help their mom. However, forcing Jeff might not be fair. So, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. \n\nIn AITA posts, usually, if someone is respecting another's boundaries and trauma, they're not in the wrong. The author might have been well-meaning but didn't account for Jeff's trauma. So maybe the answer is A. But some might say that the author was trying to help their mom and isn't in the wrong. \n\nBut the key here is whether the author had the right to tell Jeff he has an obligation. Since Jeff has the right to his own feelings and trauma, the author might have been wrong to impose that obligation. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
