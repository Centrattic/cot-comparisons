Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who posted this situation is in the wrong. The post is about the author telling their older brother, Jeff, that he has an obligation to help with their dad's funeral. The dad was abusive to Jeff when he was younger, but the author was born later, so their experience was different. The mom is upset because Jeff isn't helping, and the author tried to convince Jeff, which led to an argument.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. Jeff experienced direct abuse from their father, which is a serious issue. The author, on the other hand, might not have the same level of trauma. The author's intention was to help their mom by getting Jeff involved. But Jeff's refusal is based on his past experiences. \n\nIs the author wrong for pushing Jeff? Well, the author is trying to support their mom, which is understandable. However, they might not fully grasp Jeff's feelings. The author's approach might have been too direct, leading to Jeff's hostile reaction. \n\nOn the other hand, family obligations can be complex. Even if Jeff had a bad relationship with dad, there might be an expectation to help with the funeral, especially for the mom's sake. The author's position is in the middle, trying to mediate. But Jeff's right to his feelings is valid. \n\nSo, the key points are: Did the author have the right to tell Jeff he has an obligation? It's possible the author didn't consider Jeff's trauma enough. But Jeff's responsibility towards the family event might still be expected. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author's intentions were good, but maybe they didn't approach it sensitively. However, it's not entirely wrong to want the family to come together. The answer might be that the author is not in the wrong because they're trying to support their mom, even if Jeff's feelings are valid. But the approach could be questioned. \n\nAlternatively, some might say the author is in the wrong because they didn't respect Jeff's boundaries and his decision not to participate. Each person has the right to decide their involvement, especially after abuse. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the author respected Jeff's autonomy. The author might not be in the wrong for trying to mediate, but the method could be improved. However, the main question is if the author is in the wrong for asserting that Jeff has an obligation. Since Jeff's trauma is valid, the author might have overstepped, making them partially at fault. But it's a nuanced situation. \n\nConsidering all that, the answer is likely B (Not in the wrong) because intentions were good, and family obligations can be tricky. However, there's room to argue A (in the wrong) if the author didn't consider Jeff's trauma enough. But given the options, B seems more correct.\n"
