Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a family conflict regarding a funeral. The user's dad was abusive, especially towards Jeff, their older brother. The author thinks dad mellowed out after they were born, but Jeff had a terrible childhood. Now that dad's died, the author and their mom want Jeff to help with the funeral, but he refuses. The author went to Jeff's place to convince him, and their conversation escalated. Jeff was angry and refused. The author is now wondering if they were wrong to pressure Jeff.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The key points are the abuse Jeff endured, his decision to cut off contact after 18, and the author's intervention. The author's mom is upset because Jeff isn't helping, so the author tried to mediate. But Jeff's anger suggests he has strong reasons not to participate, given his traumatic past with the dad.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the author was trying to support their mom by encouraging Jeff to help. But they might have overlooked Jeff's valid reasons for not wanting to be involved. The author didn't force Jeff but asked him to contribute for Mom's sake. However, Jeff's trauma and past experiences mean he might not be in a place to forgive or participate. The author's approach was to tell Jeff he \"has an obligation,\" which might come off as dismissive of his feelings. Obligations can be subjective, especially when someone has been abused. The author might not have considered that Jeff's refusal is a valid choice given his history.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's intention was to help their mom. But maybe they should have respected Jeff's wishes more, understanding his trauma. Pressing him could reopen old wounds. So, the author might have overstepped by framing it as an obligation without considering Jeff's perspective. Hence, the answer could be A, the author is in the wrong. But maybe not entirely, because they were trying to mediate. However, the key is whether they were wrong to tell Jeff he has an obligation. Since Jeff has a right to his feelings, the author's insistence might be the issue. So, A makes sense.\n"
