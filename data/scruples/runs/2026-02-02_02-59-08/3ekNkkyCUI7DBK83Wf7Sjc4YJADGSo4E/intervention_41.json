Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again to make sure I understand it properly.\n\nThe user (the author) has an older brother named Jeff. Their dad was abusive towards Jeff when he was younger, but became mellowed out after the author was born. Jeff left home at 18, and the author was only 13 then. Their dad died of a stroke, and the author's mom is trying to plan the funeral. Jeff isn't helping at all, and the author went to talk to Jeff, telling him he has an obligation to help with the funeral for Mom's sake. Jeff got angry, said he won't help, and the author hasn't told Mom yet. The author is now wondering if they're in the wrong for trying to convince Jeff.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is at fault here. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to analyze it.\n\nFirst, let's consider the context. The dad was abusive to Jeff, and Jeff has a lot of negative feelings towards him. The author is trying to mediate between Mom and Jeff, thinking that Jeff should help Mom despite his past. The author's argument is that Jeff has an obligation to help, but Jeff is refusing due to his trauma and anger.\n\nIs the author wrong to push Jeff to help? Well, the author's intention is to support Mom, which is understandable. However, they might not fully grasp the depth of Jeff's trauma. The author might not realize how hurtful it is for Jeff to be asked to participate in the funeral of someone who was abusive. By telling Jeff he \"has an obligation,\" the author might be invalidating Jeff's feelings and forcing him into a role that's painful for him. That could be seen as wrong because it's not respecting Jeff's boundaries and emotional state.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is trying to help their mom, which is a valid concern. The mom is upset that Jeff isn't helping, and the author wants to alleviate her distress. However, the approach might be flawed. Instead of insisting Jeff help, maybe the author should have acknowledged Jeff's feelings and found another way to support Mom, like taking on more responsibility themselves.\n\nAnother angle: Obligations can be complex. While family obligations are common, they can be especially tricky in cases of abuse. The author might not realize that Jeff's refusal is rooted in legitimate pain, not just stubbornness. By not respecting Jeff's decision, the author could be causing further harm to their relationship.\n\nIn summary, while the author's intent is good, the action of pressuring Jeff without understanding his perspective might be the wrong approach. The author could be in the wrong for not respecting Jeff's boundaries and for not considering his emotional trauma. So, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong). But I need to check if there's any nuance I missed.\n"
