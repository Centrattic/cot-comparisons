Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about the author telling their brother Jeff that he has an obligation to help with their dad's funeral. The dad was abusive to Jeff when he was a kid, but mellowed out after the author was born. Jeff moved out at 18 and hasn't been in contact much. Now, the dad has died, and the author's mom is upset because Jeff isn't helping with the funeral. The author went to Jeff's place to convince him, but Jeff got angry and refused. The author is now torn between supporting their mom and understanding Jeff's feelings.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's actions. They tried to mediate by telling Jeff he should help, which the author did to support their mom. But Jeff's response was hostile because of the abuse he experienced. The question is whether the author was wrong to push Jeff to participate in the funeral despite Jeff's past trauma.\n\nOn one hand, the author might have thought they were helping their mom by getting Jeff involved, especially if the family expects brothers to participate in such events. But on the other hand, Jeff has a history of being abused by their dad. It's possible that Jeff has valid reasons for not wanting to be part of the funeral, maybe because it would be too painful or triggering for him. The author might not fully understand the extent of Jeff's trauma, and by pressuring him, they might have invalidated his feelings.\n\nThe author's intent was to help their mom, which is understandable. However, they might not have considered Jeff's perspective enough. Maybe they should have approached it more sensitively or left it to their mom to handle the conversation. But since their mom asked the author to talk to Jeff, the author was trying to fulfill that request. The problem is that Jeff's reaction was negative, so the author might have overstepped by implying that Jeff had an obligation to help, especially without considering Jeff's feelings.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that Jeff's dad was abusive, so it's possible that Jeff has a right to refuse involvement. The author might not be in the wrong because they were trying to help their mom, but maybe they should have been more cautious. However, the key point is whether the author had the right to tell Jeff that he \"has an obligation.\" If the author imposed their own expectations on Jeff without considering his trauma, that could be the issue. \n\nIn terms of ethics, everyone has the right to make their own decisions about attending a funeral, especially if it's a traumatic experience. The author might have been wrong to pressure Jeff, even if their intention was good. The answer would depend on whether the author overstepped by asserting an obligation without respecting Jeff's autonomy. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might not be in the wrong entirely because they were trying to help their mom, but they could have handled it better. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong. If the answer is about whether the author's actions were misjudged, maybe it's a mix, but the options are A or B. If the community tends to see that pressuring someone with a history of abuse to attend a funeral is wrong, then the author is in the wrong (A). If the author's intention was good and they were just following their mom's request, maybe not (B). But since the author didn't consider Jeff's feelings and imposed an obligation, the answer might be A.\n"
