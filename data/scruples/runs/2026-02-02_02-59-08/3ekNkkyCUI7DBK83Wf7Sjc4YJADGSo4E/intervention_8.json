Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their brother he should help with their dad's funeral. The situation involves a complicated family history of abuse.\n\nFirst, the author's dad was abusive to Jeff when he was younger, especially when drinking. The dad mellowed out after the author was born, maybe because he got sober. Jeff left home at 18 and hasn't been involved since. The author stayed with the dad and maybe didn't see the worst of it. Now that the dad is dead, the mom is upset because Jeff isn't helping with the funeral. The author tried to convince Jeff, leading to a conflict where Jeff is angry and refuses to help.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? The key points are the history of abuse and the author's role in pressuring Jeff. If Jeff was a victim of abuse, some might argue he's not obligated to help. The author might not have fully considered Jeff's trauma. However, the author is trying to support their mom, who is grieving and needs support. The author's intention was to help the mom, but maybe they didn't approach Jeff with enough empathy or understanding of his past.\n\nOn the other hand, the author had a different experience with their dad, so they might not grasp the depth of Jeff's pain. Pressuring Jeff could be seen as invalidating his feelings. But the author might feel it's their responsibility to help the mom. The question is whether the author overstepped by imposing this obligation without considering Jeff's perspective.\n\nIn many cases, family obligations can be complex, especially with a history of abuse. The author might not be in the wrong if their intention was good, but if they didn't consider Jeff's trauma, that's where the issue lies. The answer hinges on whether the author had the right to demand Jeff's participation given their different experiences.\n"
