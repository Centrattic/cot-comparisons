Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their older brother he should help with their abusive dad's funeral. \n\nFirst, the context: The dad was abusive to Jeff, especially when drinking. He mellowed out after the author was born and got sober. Jeff left home at 18 and hasn't been involved since. The dad died, and their mom is upset because Jeff isn't helping with the funeral. The author went to Jeff to convince him to help, leading to an argument where Jeff refused and was hostile.\n\nThe author's main point is that they told Jeff he had an obligation to help for their mom's sake. Jeff's response was defensive, and the author is now conflicted between their mom's feelings and Jeff's justified anger.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author was wrong. From an ethical standpoint, family obligations can be complex. The author believes Jeff should help because it's important for Mom, but Jeff has valid reasons for not wanting to participate due to past abuse. The author's approach might have been well-intentioned, but forcing someone to participate in a funeral for someone who was abusive to them could be seen as insensitive. The author might not have considered Jeff's trauma and the possibility that his presence could cause more harm than good. Additionally, the author's statement about obligation might overlook the fact that Jeff's feelings are legitimate and that the family should respect that. The author's action of confronting Jeff without a nuanced approach could have been the wrong move. So, the answer is A.\n"
