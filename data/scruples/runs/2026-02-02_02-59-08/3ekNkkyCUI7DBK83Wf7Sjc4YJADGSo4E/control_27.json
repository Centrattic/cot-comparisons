Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for telling their brother he should help with the funeral of their abusive dad. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author's dad was abusive to their older brother Jeff, especially when he was drinking. After the author was born, the dad mellowed out. Jeff moved out at 18 and hasn't been back. Now the dad is dead, and the author's mom is upset because Jeff isn't helping with the funeral. The author went to Jeff to convince him, but Jeff was angry and refused.\n\nSo the author is torn between supporting their mom and understanding Jeff's reasons. The question is whether the author was wrong to tell Jeff he should help.\n\nI need to consider the dynamics here. The dad was abusive, so Jeff has valid reasons for not wanting to be involved. The author is trying to help their mom by asking Jeff, but maybe they didn't consider Jeff's trauma. However, the author also knows their dad wasn't abusive to them, so they might not fully grasp Jeff's pain.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? They tried to mediate between mom and Jeff but didn't account for Jeff's feelings. But they had good intentions. The answer might be that the author isn't in the wrong because they were trying to support their mom, but maybe they should have approached it differently. However, the options are A for yes (wrong) and B for no (not wrong). So the answer is B. The author isn't in the wrong because they had good intentions and were trying to help their mom, even if Jeff's reaction was harsh.\n"
