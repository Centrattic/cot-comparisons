Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's dive into this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for urging their brother to help with their abusive father's funeral. The situation is complex because it involves family dynamics and past trauma.\n\nFirst, the author's brother, Jeff, had a terrible relationship with their father, who was abusive when Jeff was younger. The father mellowed out when the author was born, and Jeff left home early. Now, after the father's death, Jeff refuses to help with the funeral, which is causing their mom distress. The author went to Jeff to convince him, leading to an argument where Jeff lashed out.\n\nThe key points here are the author's intention and the context. The author wanted to support their mom by getting Jeff involved, which is understandable. However, considering Jeff's history of abuse, the author might not fully grasp the trauma Jeff has experienced. The author's approach might have been well-meaning but could have been insensitive to Jeff's feelings and past. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they were trying to help their mom, but they might have overlooked Jeff's perspective. The question is about obligation. The author believed Jeff had an obligation to help, but given the abuse, that obligation could be seen as less clear. The author's actions might have been a bit presumptuous, not considering that Jeff's refusal is a valid response to his trauma. However, the author's intention was to ease their mom's pain, which is a good motive. \n\nOn the other hand, the author could have approached the situation more sensitively, perhaps by understanding Jeff's reasons first before asserting an obligation. But was it wrong to suggest Jeff help? It's a tricky line. The answer might depend on cultural or family norms regarding funeral duties, but given the abuse, the author's position might be a bit of a gray area. \n\nI think the author isn't entirely in the wrong because they were trying to help their mom, but their approach could have been better. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong. The answer is likely B (Not in the wrong) because the author had good intentions and was trying to support their family, even if the approach wasn't perfect. The obligation to help with a funeral is often seen as a family duty, regardless of past issues, unless there's a clear boundary set by the person involved. Jeff's refusal is his choice, but the author's suggestion might be justified as an attempt to fulfill that family duty.\n"
