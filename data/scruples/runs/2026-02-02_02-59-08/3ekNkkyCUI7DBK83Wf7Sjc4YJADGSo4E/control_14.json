Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for telling their brother he has an obligation to help with their abusive father's funeral.\n\nFirst, the context: The dad was abusive to Jeff, the older brother, but mellowed out after the narrator was born. Jeff left home at 18 and hasn't been back. The mother is upset because Jeff isn't helping with the funeral. The narrator went to Jeff's house to convince him, which led to an argument.\n\nNow, considering whether the narrator is in the wrong. The key points here are the nature of the obligation and the approach taken. Obligations in such family matters can be tricky. If the family expects Jeff to participate, maybe financially or in planning, but he has a history of trauma from the father's abuse, there's a conflict here.\n\nThe narrator's intention was to support their mom's emotional needs. However, Jeff's refusal is rooted in past abuse. The narrator might not have considered that Jeff's trauma could make attending the funeral harmful. The question is whether the narrator overstepped by pressuring Jeff, implying he has an obligation despite his feelings.\n\nAlso, the way the narrator approached it might have been confrontational. Telling Jeff he's being a \"dick\" and that he owes it to mom could have triggered Jeff's anger. The narrator might not have acknowledged Jeff's valid reasons for not wanting to participate.\n\nOn the other hand, the narrator is trying to support their mom, which is understandable. However, the obligation to help with a funeral isn't absolute, especially when there's a history of abuse. The narrator's approach might have been too direct without considering Jeff's boundaries and trauma.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the narrator's intention was good, but the method and the assumption that Jeff has an obligation might be misplaced. The answer depends on whether the obligation exists beyond personal feelings. Since Jeff has a right to choose not to participate given his history, the narrator's insistence could be seen as inconsiderate of Jeff's trauma.\n\nSo, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they pressured a family member to participate in a funeral for someone who abused them, not considering their emotional boundaries. Alternatively, if the family collectively decided everyone must participate, maybe not. But given the context, the trauma is a valid reason for Jeff's refusal.\n"
