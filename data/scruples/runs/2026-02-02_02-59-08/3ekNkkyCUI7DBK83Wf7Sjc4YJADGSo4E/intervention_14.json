Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a family dealing with their dad's funeral. The author, let's call them Person A, has an older brother, Jeff, who had a really bad experience with their dad when he was younger. The dad was an abusive drunk, especially to Jeff and their mom. Jeff left home when he turned 18 and hasn't been involved since. Now that the dad has died, their mom is upset because Jeff won't help with the funeral. Person A went to talk to Jeff, told him he has an obligation to help for Mom's sake, and Jeff got angry and refused.\n\nSo the question is whether Person A is in the wrong for pushing Jeff to help. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author's intention was to support their mom, which is understandable. Mom is grieving and needs support, and maybe the author thought involving Jeff would help her heal. But Jeff has valid reasons for not wanting to participate. He was the primary victim of the abuse, and the author acknowledges that. Jeff's refusal is based on his own trauma and the fact that the father was a terrible person to him. \n\nObligations in such situations can be tricky. The author might feel Jeff should help because it's a family obligation, but Jeff might feel that participating would be retraumatizing or that the father didn't deserve their respect. The author's approach was to tell Jeff he \"has an obligation,\" which might not consider Jeff's boundaries. \n\nAlso, the author didn't consult Jeff's perspective beforehand; they just assumed Jeff should help. Maybe they should have tried to understand Jeff's feelings more deeply instead of framing it as an obligation. The author's message could come off as dismissive of Jeff's past, especially since Jeff was defensive and felt the author couldn't understand his experience. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's a gray area. The author's actions were to help their mom, but they didn't consider Jeff's emotional state and boundaries. Pressuring someone with a history of abuse to attend a funeral for the abuser could be harmful. The author might be in the wrong for not respecting Jeff's choice, even if they have good intentions. \n\nOn the other hand, the author was trying to support their mom, which is also important. But the key here is whether the author's actions were respectful of Jeff's needs. Since Jeff has a legitimate reason to refuse, the author might have overstepped by insisting on an obligation without considering his trauma. \n\nSo, the answer is probably A, the author is in the wrong because they didn't respect Jeff's boundaries and his valid reasons for not participating, even if their intention was to help their mom.\n"
