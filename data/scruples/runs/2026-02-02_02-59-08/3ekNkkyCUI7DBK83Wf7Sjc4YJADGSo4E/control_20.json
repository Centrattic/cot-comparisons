Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their older brother, Jeff, that he should help with their father's funeral, despite Jeff's past abuse.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The father was abusive to Jeff when he was younger, especially when drinking. He mellowed out after the author was born. Jeff left home at 18, hasn't been involved since. Now the father died, and the mother is upset because Jeff isn't helping with the funeral. The author tried to convince Jeff, but Jeff was angry and refused. The author is caught between their mom's feelings and Jeff's justified anger.\n\nThe key points here are obligations, forgiveness, and understanding. Should someone be obligated to help with a funeral for someone who was abusive to them? The author's intention was to help their mom, which is understandable. But Jeff has a right to protect himself from emotional pain.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, pushing someone to participate in a funeral for an abuser can be seen as invalidating their trauma. The author might not realize the depth of Jeff's feelings. However, the author is also trying to support their mother's emotional needs. \n\nIt's a complex situation. The author isn't wrong for trying to mediate, but maybe they should have approached it differently. However, the question is whether they're in the wrong. Since they acted out of a desire to help their mom without considering Jeff's trauma, they might share some responsibility. But it's more about lack of awareness than malicious intent. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but there's nuance. Alternatively, some might argue A if they think the author overstepped. I think the correct answer is B because intentions matter, but they could have handled it better.\n"
