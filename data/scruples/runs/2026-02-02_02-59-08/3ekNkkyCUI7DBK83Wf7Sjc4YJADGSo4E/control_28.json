Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their brother Jeff that he has an obligation to help with their abusive father's funeral. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Jeff had a really bad experience with their dad, who was abusive when Jeff was younger. The author, on the other hand, didn't experience that abuse directly and perhaps only heard about it from Jeff and their mom. \n\nThe author's mom is upset because Jeff isn't helping with the funeral. The author went to Jeff's house to convince him to help, but Jeff reacted angrily, saying the author doesn't understand and refuses to participate. The author now feels caught between their mom and Jeff's justified anger.\n\nNow, the key points here are about obligation and empathy. The author might feel that family obligations require Jeff to help, especially for their mom's sake. However, Jeff might feel that not being part of the funeral is a way to protect himself from trauma or to stand up against the abuse he suffered. \n\nIs the author wrong for trying to convince Jeff? Well, the author's intention was to help their mom, which is understandable. But did they overstep by implying Jeff has an obligation? The author might not fully grasp the emotional impact of the abuse on Jeff. Jeff's refusal could be a valid emotional response, and the author might have approached it without considering Jeff's feelings. \n\nOn the other hand, the author was trying to mediate a family matter, which is often a sensitive situation. They might not have realized the depth of Jeff's resentment. However, the author's action was to facilitate, not to force. The question is whether the author should have done that. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit gray. The author's action was born out of concern for their mom, but they might have underestimated Jeff's feelings. However, they weren't necessarily wrong in trying to reach out. It's more about communication and understanding rather than a clear-cut wrong. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No) because the author's intention was to help and they were in a difficult position, trying to support their mom. They might have made a mistake in approach, but it's not that they were in the wrong.\n"
