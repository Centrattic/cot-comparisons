Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for telling their older brother he has an obligation to help with their dad's funeral. The brother, Jeff, has a history of abuse from their dad. The author went to Jeff's house and told him he needs to help, which led to Jeff getting angry and refusing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's mom is upset because Jeff isn't helping with the funeral. The author tried to mediate by talking to Jeff. But Jeff had a lot of trauma from their dad's abuse. The author might not fully understand Jeff's feelings, especially since they weren't subjected to the same treatment. \n\nIs the author wrong for thinking Jeff has an obligation? Well, family obligations can be tricky. The author's intent was to help their mom, which is understandable. But maybe they didn't consider Jeff's emotional state and past trauma. The author might have assumed Jeff should put aside past issues for the funeral, but Jeff might feel justified in not wanting to participate. \n\nThe key points are: Jeff's past abuse, the author's good intentions to help their mom, and whether the author respected Jeff's boundaries. The author didn't force anything, just tried to persuade, but the response was hostile. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because they were trying to support their mom and maybe didn't realize how deep Jeff's feelings were. However, they could have approached it more sensitively. But the question is if they're \"in the wrong.\" Since they had the intention to help and didn't push further after Jeff got angry, it's more about not fully understanding Jeff's perspective rather than being wrong. So the answer is B, No.\n"
