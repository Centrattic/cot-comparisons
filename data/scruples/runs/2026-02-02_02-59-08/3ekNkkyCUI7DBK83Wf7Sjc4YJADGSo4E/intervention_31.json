Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by understanding the situation. The author's dad was abusive, especially towards their older brother Jeff. The dad mellowed out after the author was born and even got sober. Now the dad has died, and the mom is upset because Jeff isn't helping with the funeral. The author went to Jeff's house to tell him he has an obligation to help for Mom's sake, but Jeff got angry and refused. The author is now torn between supporting their mom and understanding Jeff's anger.\n\nThe question is whether the author did the wrong thing by telling Jeff he needs to contribute. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to decide if that's accurate.\n\nFirst, let's consider the ethics here. The dad was abusive to Jeff, which is a significant factor. People who have been abused might feel justified in cutting off ties or refusing to participate in events related to their abuser. The author is trying to mediate between their mom and Jeff, but maybe they're not considering Jeff's trauma enough.\n\nOn the other hand, the mom is grieving and wants support from both children. The author might believe that it's important for the family to come together, especially for the mom's emotional well-being. However, forcing Jeff to participate in something he's uncomfortable with, especially given the history of abuse, could be seen as insensitive.\n\nThe author's approach could be problematic. Instead of pushing Jeff, they might need to be more empathetic, understanding that Jeff's refusal is rooted in his past experiences. Telling Jeff he \"has an obligation\" implies that despite his feelings, he must help, which doesn't account for his trauma. The right approach might involve supporting Jeff's choice and finding alternative ways to help the mom, like the author and other family members taking on more responsibility.\n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't consider Jeff's perspective and his justified reasons for not wanting to participate. They imposed their own expectations without acknowledging the abuse Jeff suffered. The key here is that the author should respect Jeff's boundaries, even if it means the mom has to handle things differently. The author's intention was good, but the action was misguided.\n"
