Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about whether their older brother, Jeff, should help with the funeral for their dad, who was abusive towards Jeff. The author went to Jeff and told him he has an obligation to help their mom, but Jeff got angry and refused.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The dad was abusive when Jeff was younger, which is a serious issue. Jeff left home early and hasn't looked back. Now that the dad is dead, the mom is upset that Jeff isn't helping with the funeral. The author tried to mediate, but Jeff is clearly still hurt and doesn't want to be involved. \n\nThe author's argument is that Jeff owes it to their mom to help, but Jeff feels he can't because of the past abuse. Is the author wrong to push Jeff to participate despite his trauma? The author might think family obligations are important, but forcing someone to engage with a situation that triggers bad memories could be problematic. \n\nOn the other hand, the mom is hurting, and the author wants to support her. But maybe the author didn't consider Jeff's feelings enough. It's possible that the author assumed Jeff should let go of past hurt for the family's sake, but that might be unfair. Jeff has valid reasons for not wanting to help. The author might be in the wrong for not respecting Jeff's boundaries and experiences.\n\nSo, balancing these factors, the answer might be that the author is in the wrong because they didn't adequately consider Jeff's perspective and the trauma he's dealing with. Therefore, the answer would be A.\n"
