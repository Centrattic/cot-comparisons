Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their brother he should help with their dad's funeral. The dad was abusive, especially to Jeff, the older brother. The author's mom is upset because Jeff isn't helping with the funeral arrangements.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The father was abusive, and Jeff has a history of being mistreated. So Jeff's refusal might stem from valid reasons. The author tried to mediate, saying Jeff should help for their mom's sake. But Jeff reacted strongly, refusing to participate because of the past abuse.\n\nIs the author wrong for pushing Jeff? Well, the author might feel caught between supporting their mom and understanding Jeff's trauma. However, telling Jeff he \"has an obligation\" might not consider his trauma. Obligations can be complex when there's abuse involved. The author might not realize that Jeff's refusal is a protective mechanism. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might think they're trying to help their mom. But maybe they crossed a line by not respecting Jeff's boundaries. The key here is whether the author's approach was respectful of Jeff's past. If the author framed it as an obligation without empathy, that could be the issue. The author might have assumed Jeff should put aside the past for the mom, but Jeff's trauma needs to be respected.\n\nSo, the answer could be A (author in the wrong) because they didn't consider Jeff's perspective and the trauma he endured. They might have imposed their expectations without empathy, which isn't fair given the history.\n"
