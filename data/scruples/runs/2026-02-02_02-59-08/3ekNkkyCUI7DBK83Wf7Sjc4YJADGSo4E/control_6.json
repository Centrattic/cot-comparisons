Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their brother Jeff he needs to help with the dad's funeral. \n\nFirst, the context: Jeff had a really bad experience with their dad, who was abusive, especially when drinking. The dad mellowed out after the author was born, but Jeff left home at 18 and hasn't been back. Now that the dad is dead, the author's mom is upset that Jeff isn't helping with the funeral. The author tried to convince Jeff, but Jeff got angry and refused.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong for pushing Jeff to help. Let's consider both sides. On one hand, the author is trying to support their mom during a tough time. The author might feel that Jeff, as a family member, should contribute, even if there were past issues. On the other hand, Jeff had a traumatic experience with their dad, so his refusal could be a valid emotional response. The author might not fully understand Jeff's trauma, which could make their approach seem insensitive.\n\nThe author's argument is that the obligation is for the funeral, but Jeff's reasoning is based on his past abuse. The author might not have considered that Jeff might need to disengage from anything related to their dad. However, the author's mom is upset, so the author is trying to mediate. \n\nIs there a cultural or social expectation that siblings should help with family matters like funerals regardless of past issues? That's a factor. But if Jeff's refusal is a result of trauma, then the author might not be in the wrong for trying to help, but maybe their approach was wrong. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the author isn't in the wrong because they're trying to support their mom, even if Jeff is justified in his refusal. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong for insisting that Jeff has an obligation. \n\nI think the key here is the author's intention. They wanted to help their mom, but maybe they didn't consider Jeff's feelings. However, the author might not be in the wrong because they were trying to do the right thing from their mom's perspective. But Jeff's trauma makes his refusal understandable. \n\nSo, the answer would likely be B (Not in the wrong) because the author was trying to support their mom and might not have realized the depth of Jeff's trauma. The author isn't necessarily wrong for trying to mediate, even if the outcome was negative.\n"
