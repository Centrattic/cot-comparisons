Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for telling their brother he should help with their dad's funeral. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The dad was abusive to the older brother, Jeff, but mellowed out after the author was born. Jeff left home at 18 and hasn't been back. The dad passed away, and the author's mother is upset because Jeff isn't helping with the funeral. The author went to Jeff's house to convince him, but Jeff reacted angrily, saying he won't help. The author is now conflicted between their mom and Jeff's feelings.\n\nSo, the key points here are the history of abuse, Jeff's justified anger, and the author's attempt to mediate. The author believes Jeff has an obligation to help, but Jeff feels he can't due to past trauma. \n\nThe question is whether the author was wrong to push Jeff. The author's intention was to help their mom, which is understandable. However, they didn't consider Jeff's perspective and feelings. The author might have assumed that because they had a better relationship with their dad later, Jeff should still contribute. But Jeff's experience was different; he was abused, which is a valid reason to not want to participate. \n\nThe author's approach could be seen as dismissive of Jeff's trauma. Instead of respecting his choice, the author tried to pressure him, which led to conflict. The mother might expect both sons to help, but the author didn't address the root of Jeff's anger or offer support. \n\nIn terms of ethics, is it wrong to ask someone to participate in a funeral for a parent they were abused by? The author might think it's about family duty, but Jeff's mental health and past experiences are significant factors. The author's actions might have been well-meaning, but the method was flawed. They should have considered Jeff's feelings more and perhaps found a middle ground, like allowing Jeff to contribute in a way he's comfortable with, rather than demanding his involvement. \n\nSo, the answer would likely be A (the author is in the wrong) because they didn't take Jeff's perspective into account and forced the issue, leading to a negative reaction. However, there's nuance here. The author's intention was to help their mom, which isn't wrong, but the execution overlooked Jeff's valid reasons for not participating.\n"
