Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is at fault here. The situation is about the author telling their brother Jeff that he has an obligation to help with their dad's funeral despite the abuse. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics. The dad was abusive towards Jeff when he was younger, became sober after the author was born, and then mellowed out. Jeff left home at 18 and hasn't been in contact since. Now that the dad died, the mom and author are handling the funeral, but Jeff refuses to help. The author tried to convince Jeff, leading to an argument.\n\nThe key points here are the obligation to help a parent's funeral and the history of abuse. On one side, the mom is upset and wants Jeff's support. On the other, Jeff doesn't want to associate with their dad's memory due to past trauma. The author tried to mediate, but Jeff was hostile.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for expecting Jeff to help. Legally, there's no obligation to pay for a parent's funeral unless there's a will specifying that. Emotionally, it's different. Jeff's refusal is due to valid reasons\u2014he was abused. The author might not see the severity of that trauma. But the author's intention was to support their mom.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, people often feel guilty for causing conflict. The author's mistake might be not understanding Jeff's perspective. However, the author was trying to help their mom, which is also valid. It's a tough spot. The answer might hinge on whether pressuring Jeff was fair given his history. Since Jeff has a right to disassociate from his abusive past, the author might be in the right for trying to help mom, but perhaps not considering Jeff's feelings enough. Hmm. I think the author isn't in the wrong because they were trying to support their mom, but maybe they should have been more empathetic. But the question is if they're in the wrong. The answer is B.\n"
