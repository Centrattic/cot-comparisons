Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their older brother he has an obligation to help with their abusive father's funeral. \n\nFirst, the context: The father was abusive to Jeff, the older brother, especially when he was younger. He became less abusive after the author was born, maybe due to sobriety. Jeff left home as soon as he could. Now the father has died, and the author and their mom are handling the funeral, but Jeff is refusing to help. The author was asked by the mom to convince Jeff, and when they did, Jeff got angry and refused.\n\nThe main issue here is whether the author was right to pressure Jeff to help with the funeral, given the abusive past. On one hand, the author is trying to support their mom, who is upset because Jeff isn't helping. On the other hand, Jeff has a valid reason not to want to be involved in the funeral of someone who was abusive to him. The author might not fully understand the trauma Jeff went through, and by pushing Jeff, the author might be invalidating his feelings.\n\nObligations can be subjective. Some might argue that family obligations are important, but others would say that someone shouldn't be forced to participate in a funeral for someone who was abusive to them. The author's approach might have been too direct and not empathetic enough towards Jeff's past experiences. Instead of framing it as an obligation, perhaps the author should have tried to understand Jeff's perspective first and maybe found a middle ground.\n\nSo, considering that Jeff's refusal is rooted in his traumatic experiences, the author's insistence on obligation might be inappropriate. The author could have handled it more sensitively. Therefore, the answer might be A, the author is in the wrong. But I need to check if there's a point where the author had a right to involve Jeff for the mother's sake. However, the mother's feelings are significant too. But the key is whether the author's approach was wrong. Telling Jeff he has an obligation without considering his feelings might be the mistake. So I think the answer is A.\n"
