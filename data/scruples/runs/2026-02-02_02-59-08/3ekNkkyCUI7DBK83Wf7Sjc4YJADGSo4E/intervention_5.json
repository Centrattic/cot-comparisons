Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the narrator is in the wrong for telling their brother he should help with their dad's funeral. The key points here are the context of the abusive past, the brother's refusal, and the narrator's actions.\n\nFirst, the dad was abusive towards Jeff, as he described, but the narrator didn't experience the same treatment. Jeff moved out early, got sober, and cut ties. Now, the mom is upset that Jeff isn't helping with the funeral. The narrator went to Jeff to convince him, which led to an argument where Jeff refused.\n\nThe question is whether the narrator is wrong for expecting Jeff to help. Considering the abuse Jeff endured, it's reasonable that he's reluctant. The narrator might not fully grasp the trauma Jeff went through. By pushing Jeff to contribute, the narrator is prioritizing the mom's feelings over Jeff's well-being. The mom's staying with the abusive dad was a choice, but that doesn't negate Jeff's trauma. The narrator's intervention might have been well-intentioned, but it's possible they didn't consider Jeff's perspective. The answer likely leans towards the narrator being in the right because they wanted to support the mom, but maybe there's nuance. However, the main issue is whether demanding Jeff to participate despite his trauma is wrong. The narrator might not be in the wrong because they were trying to help the mom, but they could have handled it differently. However, the correct answer based on the analysis might be B, not in the wrong. Wait, but if Jeff was abused and the narrator is making him help, maybe the narrator is in the right to let the mom know Jeff can't help. Hmm. The user initially thought the author is in the wrong, but maybe the answer is B.\n"
