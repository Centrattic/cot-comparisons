Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for telling their older brother Jeff that he should help with their dad's funeral. The key points here are the abuse Jeff suffered, the author's perspective, and the conflict between family members.\n\nFirst, the dad was abusive towards Jeff, especially when drunk, which Jeff and their mom both experienced. The author didn't face the same treatment, probably because the dad mellowed out after they were born. Jeff left home as soon as he could, which suggests he's been trying to distance himself from the toxic environment. \n\nThe author's mom is upset because Jeff isn't helping with the funeral. The author went to Jeff to convince him, which led to Jeff lashing out. The author now feels caught between Mom's needs and Jeff's justified anger. \n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong for urging Jeff to help. On one hand, the author might think it's important for the family to come together for the funeral, especially to support Mom. On the other hand, Jeff has valid reasons to be angry and disconnected from the dad. The author might not fully grasp the trauma Jeff went through, especially since he wasn't the one abused. \n\nI need to consider if the author overstepped. The author's intention was to help Mom, but maybe they didn't take into account Jeff's emotional state and history. The author assumed Jeff should feel obligated despite the abuse, which might be unfair. Obligations in such cases can be complex, especially with unresolved trauma. \n\nAlso, the author's approach might have been confrontational, leading to Jeff's outburst. Perhaps a more empathetic approach, acknowledging Jeff's pain, would have been better. The author might have acted without fully understanding the depth of Jeff's resentment. \n\nSo, while the author's intention was to support Mom, they might have dismissed Jeff's legitimate reasons for not wanting to participate. That could be seen as inconsiderate. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting Jeff's boundaries and past trauma.\n"
