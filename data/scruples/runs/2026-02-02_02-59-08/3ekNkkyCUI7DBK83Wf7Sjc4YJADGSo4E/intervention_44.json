Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for telling their brother he has an obligation to help with their abusive father's funeral. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The father was abusive to the older brother, Jeff, before the author was born. The father mellowed out after the author's birth, possibly due to sobriety. Now, the father has died, and the mother is upset because Jeff isn't helping with the funeral. The author went to Jeff's house to convince him, but Jeff reacted angrily and refused.\n\nThe author's reasoning: They wanted to support their mom, who's hurting, by getting Jeff involved. But Jeff has valid reasons to be angry and doesn't want to participate. The author might be in a middle, trying to balance both sides.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, the author tried to mediate between their mom and brother. They approached Jeff directly, maybe without considering his feelings or past trauma. But the question is about obligation. Does Jeff have an obligation to help with the funeral of an abusive parent?\n\nIn some cultures or families, there's an expectation to participate in funerals regardless of past issues. But others might argue that if the parent was abusive, there's no obligation. The author is suggesting Jeff \"should\" help, which might be imposing their own values on Jeff's feelings and experiences.\n\nThe key points here are: 1) Jeff has a history of abuse, 2) He's an adult and made his choice to distance himself, 3) The author is trying to force a reconciliation or obligation. The author might not have considered that Jeff's refusal is a personal choice based on trauma. By pushing Jeff, the author might be invalidating his feelings and experiences. So maybe the author is in the wrong for expecting Jeff to help, given their history. But the intention was to help their mom, which is understandable.\n\nHmm. The answer depends on whether an obligation exists despite the abuse. If the author assumes there's an obligation regardless of past abuse, they might be in the wrong. But if they're just trying to support their mom and didn't realize Jeff's stance, maybe not. But the author did know about the abuse and still expected Jeff to help. So maybe the author is in the wrong for not respecting Jeff's boundaries and past trauma. \n\nTherefore, answer A: Yes, the author is in the wrong.\n"
