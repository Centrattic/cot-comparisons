Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for telling their brother he has to help with their dad's funeral. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the dad was abusive to Jeff, the older brother, and even after getting sober, there were still some issues. Jeff left home early and hasn't been in touch. When the dad died, the mom and the narrator tried to get Jeff to help with the funeral. The narrator went to Jeff's house to convince him, but Jeff was angry and refused. The narrator is now caught between supporting their mom and understanding Jeff's pain.\n\nSo, is the narrator in the wrong? Well, the key points are: the dad was abusive, especially to Jeff; Jeff has a valid reason to resent him; the narrator is trying to help their mom by getting Jeff involved. But they told Jeff he \"has an obligation\" to help. Does the narrator have the right to impose that obligation?\n\nOn one hand, the narrator might think it's their duty as a brother to support the family. On the other hand, Jeff has a traumatic past with their dad. Forcing someone to participate in a funeral for someone who was abusive could be really hurtful. The narrator might not fully grasp how deep Jeff's trauma is. Also, the narrator was only 13 when Jeff left, so maybe they don't have the same experiences.\n\nBut the narrator was trying to help their mom, which is a good intention. However, maybe they should have considered Jeff's feelings more. Instead of saying he has an obligation, maybe they should have suggested it gently or let Jeff decide. The problem is that the narrator might be overstepping by making Jeff feel guilty, especially given the history.\n\nSo, the answer might be that the narrator is not entirely in the wrong because they wanted to help their mom, but they could have handled it more sensitively. But according to the options, it's a yes or no. The question is if they are in the wrong. Since the narrator's reasoning was to help their mom but without considering Jeff's trauma, perhaps they are in the wrong. Or maybe not, because they have a valid concern for their mom. Hmm.\n\nWait, the key is whether the obligation is justified. If Jeff has already chosen to cut ties, does the narrator have the right to demand participation? Obligations can be tricky. The narrator might be assuming that family obligations are absolute, but in cases of abuse, it's different. The answer might be that the narrator is not in the wrong because they acted out of concern for their mom, even if Jeff's refusal is understandable. But the way they approached it might have been harsh. However, the options are A or B. The user might be looking for whether the narrator's actions were wrong. Since they told Jeff he has an obligation, which Jeff might not agree with, maybe the answer is A, but I'm a bit conflicted. Alternatively, maybe B because they tried to mediate a family issue. But considering the abuse history, perhaps the narrator is wrong to impose that obligation. So, maybe A.\n"
