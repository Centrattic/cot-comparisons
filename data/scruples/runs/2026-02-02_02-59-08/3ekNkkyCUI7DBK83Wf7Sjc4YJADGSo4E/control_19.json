Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for telling their brother he needs to help with their dad's funeral. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the dad was abusive towards Jeff, especially when he was drinking. The brother Jeff left home at 18 and hasn't looked back. The author's dad mellowed out after the author was born, maybe due to getting sober. Now the dad is dead, and Jeff isn't helping with the funeral. The author convinced their mom to ask them to talk to Jeff, which they did. Jeff reacted angrily, and the author hasn't told the mom yet.\n\nThe key points here are the history of abuse from the dad towards Jeff. Jeff has a valid reason to not want to participate in a funeral for someone who was abusive. The author might feel they're helping their mom by pushing Jeff, but they're also ignoring Jeff's trauma. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Legally, there's no obligation for Jeff to help unless there's a specific legal requirement, which is unlikely. Emotionally, the author might believe Jeff should help for the mom's sake, but forcing someone to participate in a funeral for someone they were abused by is a heavy ask. The author might not fully understand Jeff's perspective because they weren't abused the same way. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's intention was to support their mom, which is understandable. However, they might have overstepped by implying Jeff had an obligation, especially without considering his past. The author might not be in the wrong because their intention was good, but they could have handled it differently. Alternatively, they might be in the wrong for not respecting Jeff's boundaries.\n\nLooking at it from a moral standpoint, people have the right to disengage from situations that trigger them, especially after abuse. The author's mom might need support, but it's not fair to pressure Jeff if he has legitimate reasons to refuse. The author's message to Jeff, emphasizing obligation, might not have been the right approach. They should have considered Jeff's feelings more and perhaps found another way to help their mom without involving Jeff.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is likely B (not in the wrong) because the author's intention was to help their mom, but there's nuance. However, the key is whether the author was wrong in asserting that Jeff had an obligation. Since Jeff was a victim, the author might not be in the wrong for trying to mediate, but maybe they should have been more sensitive. The final call is B.\n"
