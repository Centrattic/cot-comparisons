Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who posted the story (AITA) is in the wrong for telling their older brother he has an obligation to help with their abusive dad's funeral.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The dad was abusive to Jeff, especially when drunk. He mellowed out after the narrator was born. Jeff left home at 18 and hasn't been back. Now the dad died, and the mom is upset because Jeff isn't helping with the funeral. The narrator went to Jeff to convince him to help for Mom's sake, but Jeff got angry and refused.\n\nSo, the question is: Did the narrator do the wrong thing by insisting Jeff should help?\n\nFrom one side, the narrator is trying to support their mom during a difficult time. They might believe family should support each other, even for a deceased parent. They might feel Jeff's refusal is hurting their mom, and they want to help her.\n\nOn the other side, Jeff has valid reasons. He was abused by their dad and chose to cut ties. Making him participate in the funeral could be retraumatizing. The narrator might not fully understand Jeff's trauma, especially since they weren't present for the abuse. Forcing Jeff to engage might not be fair, even if the intention is to help Mom.\n\nThe key points here are intent vs. outcome. The narrator's intent was good\u2014to help Mom. But Jeff's feelings and history need to be considered. The narrator might be in a position where they don't grasp the depth of Jeff's trauma. Obligating someone to participate in a funeral for a parent who was abusive can be seen as insensitive. The narrator might have overstepped by implying Jeff has an obligation without considering his perspective.\n\nHowever, the narrator is also caught between two family members. They're trying to mediate but didn't handle it well. Instead of pushing Jeff, maybe they should have suggested other ways to support Mom without involving Jeff. But the act of trying to convince Jeff, despite his reasons, might be seen as the narrator being in the wrong.\n"
