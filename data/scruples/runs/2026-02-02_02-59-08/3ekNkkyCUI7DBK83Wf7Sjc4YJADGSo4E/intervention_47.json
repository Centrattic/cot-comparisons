Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for telling their brother Jeff that he has an obligation to help with their dad's funeral, even though their dad was abusive.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The dad was abusive towards Jeff and their mom, especially when he was drinking. Jeff moved out when he was 18, and the dad mellowed out later. Now the dad has died, and the mom is upset that Jeff won't help with the funeral. The author went to Jeff's place to convince him, leading to an argument. The author is now torn between supporting their mom and understanding Jeff's perspective.\n\nThe key points here are the obligation to help with the funeral despite the abuse. The author might think that family responsibilities override past issues, but Jeff is justified in not wanting to participate because of the abuse. The author's actions were well-intentioned (to help their mom) but may have overstepped by implying Jeff has an obligation, which he might not feel. The author didn't consider Jeff's trauma and boundaries, which could be why Jeff reacted so strongly.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they tried to mediate, but maybe they shouldn't have pressured Jeff without understanding his stance. The author might not realize that Jeff's refusal is about protecting his mental health. So, the answer could be A (the author is in the wrong) because they didn't respect Jeff's boundaries and forced him into a situation he's not comfortable with. But maybe some would argue that the author was trying to help their mom, so it's a gray area. However, considering the abuse history, the author's insistence on obligation might be misplaced.\n"
