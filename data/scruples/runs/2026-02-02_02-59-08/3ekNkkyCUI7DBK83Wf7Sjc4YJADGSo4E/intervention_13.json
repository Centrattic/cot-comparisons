Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation is about the author telling their older brother, Jeff, that he has an obligation to help with their father's funeral, even though their dad was abusive to Jeff.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The father was abusive when Jeff was younger, but he mellowed out after the author was born. Jeff moved out at 18 and hasn't been in contact. Now that their dad died, the mom is upset because Jeff isn't helping with the funeral. The author went to Jeff's place to convince him, but Jeff reacted angrily, refusing to help. The author is now torn between supporting their mom and understanding Jeff's feelings.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to evaluate both sides. \n\nOn one hand, the author tried to mediate and help their mom. They might feel that since their brother is part of the family, he should contribute to the funeral, especially for their mom's sake. The author might believe in family obligations, even if there's past conflict.\n\nOn the other hand, Jeff has a valid reason to refuse. He was abused by their father and may not want to participate in any way. Forcing him to help could be seen as invalidating his trauma. The author might not fully understand the depth of Jeff's pain, hence the argument that the author is in the wrong for not respecting Jeff's boundaries.\n\nBut is the author wrong for trying to reach out? If the author's intention was to help their mom, maybe they didn't consider that Jeff might not want to engage. However, the approach of telling Jeff he \"has an obligation\" might come off as demanding, which could escalate the situation. The author might have been well-meaning but didn't handle it sensitively.\n\nAnother angle is the concept of family responsibility. Some might argue that even in cases of abuse, families should support each other in death. Others would say that if someone cut ties for a valid reason, they shouldn't be pressured. \n\nThe key here is whether the author overstepped by implying obligation without considering Jeff's trauma. The author might have thought they were doing the right thing by their mom, but the method could be flawed. So maybe the author isn't entirely in the wrong, but there's room for criticism in the approach.\n\nBut the user says they think the author is in the wrong. So I need to decide if the author's actions were wrong. The answer hinges on whether the author had the right to impose family obligations on someone who has a history of abuse. The author might have done it for their mom's benefit, but Jeff's autonomy and trauma are important factors. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting Jeff's decision, even if the intent was good. So the answer would be A.\n"
