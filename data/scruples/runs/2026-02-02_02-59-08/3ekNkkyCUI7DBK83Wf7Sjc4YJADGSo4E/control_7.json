Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong (AITA) for telling their older brother he has an obligation to help with their dad's funeral. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The father was abusive towards Jeff when he was younger, but mellowed out after the author was born. Jeff left home at 18, and the author stayed with their mom. Now the dad has died, and the mom is upset because Jeff isn't helping with the funeral. The author went to Jeff to convince him, but Jeff was angry and refused.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author was wrong to tell Jeff he should help. Let's break it down. \n\nThe author's mom is upset, and they want to support her. They might think it's important for the family to come together, especially for the mother's sake. On the other hand, Jeff has a valid reason not to participate because of the abuse. The author might not fully understand Jeff's trauma. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the author's intention was to help their mom, which is understandable. But they might have assumed Jeff has an obligation without considering his feelings. However, the author also acknowledges that Jeff has reasons to be upset. The key point is whether the author was wrong in expecting Jeff to help despite his past.\n\nIn situations like this, people often have different boundaries. Jeff's refusal could be about his own mental health and healing. The author might not have been in the wrong for trying to mediate, but maybe they should have been more sensitive to Jeff's perspective. However, since the author's intention was to support their mom, it's a delicate balance. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because they were trying to help their mom and might not have intended to disregard Jeff's feelings. But they could have approached the situation more carefully. Since the answer is A or B, and the options are whether they're in the wrong, I think the answer is B (not in the wrong) because their actions were motivated by concern for their mother and they might not have understood the depth of Jeff's trauma. However, there's nuance here. But according to AITA standards, the author is probably not in the wrong.\n"
