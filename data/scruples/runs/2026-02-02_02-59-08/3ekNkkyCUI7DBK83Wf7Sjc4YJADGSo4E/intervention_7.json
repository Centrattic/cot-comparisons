Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who posted the story (AITA) is in the wrong for telling their brother he has an obligation to help with their dad's funeral. The dad was abusive, especially to Jeff, and Jeff has been avoiding contact since moving out. The author went to Jeff's house to convince him to help with the funeral to make their mom feel better.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of the abuse. Jeff was a victim of domestic abuse here, which is a serious issue. The dad's behavior towards Jeff was harmful, and the fact that he moved out immediately at 18 suggests he's been cutting off ties for a long time. The author, on the other hand, had a somewhat mellowed dad after being born, so they might not fully understand Jeff's trauma.\n\nThe author's motivation is to support their mom, which is understandable. However, pushing Jeff to participate in the funeral might be ignoring his emotional boundaries. Jeff's anger and refusal make sense given his history. Obligating someone to participate in a funeral for someone who was abusive can be seen as invalidating their experiences.\n\nThe key here is whether the author had the right to tell Jeff he \"has an obligation\" to help. Obligation implies a duty, but in cases of abuse, people might have different emotional needs. The author might not realize that Jeff's refusal is a form of self-preservation. The author's approach was confrontational, leading to an argument, which didn't resolve the issue.\n\nSo, the author's mistake was framing it as an obligation rather than understanding Jeff's perspective. They should have approached the situation with more empathy, acknowledging Jeff's past and not forcing him to participate. Therefore, the answer leans towards the author being in the wrong (A).\n"
