Growing up, I could definitely see flashes of who he was, especially when he interacted with Jeff, but all of these things Jeff described never happened with me. Jeff moved out as soon as he turned 18 and I was only 13 and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nI know that he got sober not long after my birth so I\u2019m sure that was part of it. My mom told me stories of how he treated them back in the day too so I know it wasn\u2019t entirely Jeff\u2019s imagination. Although why she stayed with him, I guess was a factor of the abuse. \n\nWell, Dad died of a stroke last month and Mom &amp; I have been trying to get together arrangements for his funeral. Mom has been really distraught, not only because of his death, but the fact that Jeff isn\u2019t helping at all with the funeral planning. \n\nShe asked me one day if I could go over to his place and convince him to be a part of the funeral. \n\nI went over to his place the other day and I told him that he is making Mom super upset by not helping with the funeral and that I get that he has a lot of shit to deal with because of dad but that he needs to stop being such a dick to mom. \n\nHe went off on me then. Starting calling me an idiot, saying that I was lucky that dad never treated me the way he treated him, that I would never understand what dad put him through and then that under no circumstances will he help with \u201cthat asshole\u2019s\u201d funeral.  He told me to get the fuck out of his house and I didn\u2019t want to cause any more problems so I left. \n\nI haven\u2019t told mom yet what happened because I feel like I\u2019m caught between two places. On the one hand I feel for Mom, but I also understand kind of why Jeff doesn\u2019t want to help. \n\nSo AITA for telling Jeff that he needs to contribute to the funeral for Mom\u2019s sake?\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their brother he needs to help with the funeral of their abusive dad. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: their dad was abusive towards Jeff, especially when drinking. The author wasn't around for that as much after being born, and the dad mellowed. Jeff left home at 18, hasn't been back. Dad dies, mom is upset because Jeff isn't helping with funeral. Author went to Jeff's place to convince him to help for mom's sake. Jeff got angry, said he won't help. The author is now questioning if they're in the wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here. The author's intention was to support their mom. They wanted to reconcile the family, help mom by getting Jeff involved. But Jeff has a valid reason for not wanting to participate due to past abuse. The author might not fully grasp the depth of Jeff's trauma. However, the author is trying to do what they think is right for the mom.\n\nIs the author wrong? Well, they were trying to mediate between mom and Jeff. But maybe they overstepped? Jeff has every right to not want to participate in a funeral for someone who was abusive. The author might not have considered that Jeff's refusal is a healthy boundary. Telling Jeff he \"has an obligation\" could be the problem. Obligation implies duty, but Jeff's trauma makes his refusal understandable. The author's approach might have been too forceful, not considering Jeff's feelings.\n\nOn the other hand, the mom is grieving and needs support. The author's intention was to help her, which is also valid. But the author should have considered if Jeff even wants to be involved, rather than pushing him to help. The author might not be in the wrong because they were trying to help mom, but they could have handled it differently, perhaps respecting Jeff's decision instead of insisting he has an obligation.\n\nSo the answer might be B (No), because the author's intent was good, but they might not fully understand Jeff's perspective. However, the key is whether the author was wrong in asserting an obligation. Since Jeff has a right to not participate, the author was wrong to tell him he must help. But the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. Maybe the answer is A or B. Need to decide.\n\nWait, the author was told by mom to convince Jeff. The author did that, but Jeff has a valid reason. The author might not be in the wrong for trying to help mom, but they might not consider Jeff's needs. However, the question is about being in the wrong. The author's action (telling Jeff he has an obligation) could be seen as wrong because it dismisses Jeff's valid reasons. So the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong). Or maybe B (No), because the author is trying to help mom. Hmm.\n\nBut the core issue is whether Jeff is obligated. Since Jeff has a history of abuse, the author shouldn't impose that obligation. The author's mistake was in telling Jeff he must help, not considering his boundaries. Therefore, the author is in the wrong. So answer A.\n"
