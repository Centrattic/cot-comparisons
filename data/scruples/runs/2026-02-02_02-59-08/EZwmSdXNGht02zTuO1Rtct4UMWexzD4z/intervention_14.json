The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. So the question is whether the teacher is in the wrong for not helping a student from another school. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the teacher offers free tutoring to their own students after school. They mention the school is in a low-economic area, and they provide snacks themselves. They have a set schedule, 45-minute sessions starting right after school at 2:50 PM. \n\nThen a parent from another school contacts them, asking if they can tutor her son. The problem is that this child is in a different county and their school lets out later, so he can't come at 2:50. The teacher offered to tutor him separately, which would mean the kid arrives at 4:15 PM. The teacher's workday ends at 6:30, so by 4:15, they're already tired. Plus, they have to drive home (40 minutes) and help their own son with homework. The teacher asks for $25 per session, but the parent gets angry, calling them names and accusing them of caring only about money.\n\nNow, the teacher is conflicted. They feel they're not in the wrong for asking for compensation, but the parent's reaction is hurting them. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know if others agree.\n\nSo, let's consider the factors. The teacher is already providing free tutoring for their own students, which is a generous gesture, especially in a low-income area. They have a set schedule that's already demanding. Adding another student from another school would require them to stay after 2:50, which might not be feasible. Also, the teacher has personal commitments (helping their own son) and the drive home. \n\nThe parent's request is understandable\u2014she's trying to help her child. But the teacher isn't obligated to tutor outside their school or their set schedule. However, asking for $25 when the going rate is $30 might seem reasonable, but the parent's reaction is extreme. The teacher isn't in the wrong for not agreeing to the arrangement, especially if it's not feasible. \n\nBut wait, the teacher is in a position of authority and might be seen as gatekeeping resources. However, the teacher is not the one who caused the situation; the parent imposed an impractical request. The teacher's offer was conditional on the child arriving on time. When that's not possible, the teacher is within their rights to decline. \n\nThe parent's anger stems from feeling that the teacher is prioritizing money over kids. But the teacher is already giving their time for free. The fact that the parent couldn't meet the scheduling constraints isn't the teacher's fault. \n\nSo, the answer is likely B (No, the author isn't in the wrong). The teacher isn't obligated to provide tutoring beyond their capacity or outside their school. The parent's request was impractical, and the teacher was within their right to decline, especially considering the personal and logistical challenges.\n"
