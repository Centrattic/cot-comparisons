The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. Let me read through the scenario again to understand the details.\n\nThe teacher is in a rural, low-income area and offers free tutoring sessions after school. A parent from another school, whose friend's child is being tutored, asks if the teacher can also tutor her son. The son is in a different county and school, which releases later, making it impossible to join the existing sessions. The parent wants the teacher to adjust their schedule to accommodate the son, which would mean the teacher has to stay later. The teacher offers to do it for $25 per session, but the parent gets angry, calling her names and accusing her of not caring about kids.\n\nThe question is whether the teacher is in the wrong for not helping and charging for the extra time. The user initially thinks the teacher is in the wrong but is curious about the answer.\n\nFirst, let's look at the teacher's perspective. She's already providing free tutoring, using her own time and money for snacks. She's in a position where she's giving of her own resources. When asked to accommodate another student, she can't adjust her schedule because she has her own son to take care of at home. She offers to do it for $25, which is below the market rate. The parent reacts negatively, implying that the teacher is selfish and only in it for money.\n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, the teacher isn't under any obligation to tutor students outside her school or county. The existing tutoring is already a voluntary, unpaid effort. The parent is asking for an additional service that would require the teacher to work extra hours beyond her capacity. Charging for that time is reasonable, especially since she's using her own time and energy. The parent's reaction is hostile and personal, which seems unwarranted given the teacher's offer to help for a fee.\n\nHowever, maybe the teacher could have been more empathetic. The parent's child is struggling with reading, which is a serious issue. But the teacher does mention that she has her own family responsibilities and is already stretched thin. She's not refusing to help entirely; she's just setting boundaries and offering an alternative solution. The parent's anger seems to stem from the teacher setting a boundary, which might be where the misunderstanding lies.\n\nThe key points here are: the teacher's existing unpaid efforts, the logistical impossibility of including the new student in the current setup, the teacher's personal limitations (energy and time after work), and the parent's refusal to accept a paid option. The teacher isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries and charging a reasonable rate. The parent's accusations are baseless and personal, especially since the teacher isn't obligated to help at all. Therefore, the answer would be B, the teacher is not in the wrong.\n"
