The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the teacher who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for not helping a student from another school. The teacher provides a detailed explanation of the situation.\n\nFirst, the teacher tutors her own students for free after school, providing snacks and managing her own time. Then a parent from another school approaches her about tutoring her son. The student is in a different county and school, with a later dismissal time. The teacher offers to tutor him but at a cost of $25 per session because she can't accommodate the time for free. The parent gets angry, calling her names and accusing her of being selfish and money-driven.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants to know what I think. I need to decide between A (Yes, author is in the wrong) or B (No, not in the wrong).\n\nLet me break it down. The teacher's initial tutoring is free for her own students because of district policies. She's already taking time after school, which she mentions is draining. When the parent from another school asks, the teacher can't adjust her schedule to fit the other student's later dismissal because she has her own energy limits and family responsibilities. She offers to tutor the other student but at a fee, which the parent refuses to accept and attacks her for it.\n\nIs it the teacher's fault? Well, the teacher is following her district's rules (no charging for tutoring students). She's already giving her time and resources to her own students. She's trying to help the other child but can't do it for free due to time constraints. The parent's reaction is extreme. The teacher isn't obligated to help outside her job, especially with someone else's child. Charging for the time is reasonable since she's giving up her personal time that she needs for family. The parent might have expected the teacher to help for free, but that's not fair. The teacher set boundaries, which is understandable.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the teacher could have been more understanding of the parent's situation. But the teacher has her own limits. She's not the one who started the tutoring; the parent approached her. She made it clear the time constraints and offered a fee. The parent's reaction is inappropriate, but the teacher's actions are justified. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
