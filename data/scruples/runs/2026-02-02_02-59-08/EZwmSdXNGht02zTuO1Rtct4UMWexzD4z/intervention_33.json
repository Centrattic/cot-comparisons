The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The teacher is offering free tutoring to her students after school, which she can't charge for because of conflict of interest. She's doing this because the area is low-income, and she's even providing snacks out of her pocket. Then a parent from another school asks if she can tutor her son. The problem is the boy is in a different county and school, so he can't make the usual time.\n\nThe teacher says he can come later, but that would be after 4:15, and she's exhausted by then. She offers to do it for $25 per session. The parent gets angry, calls her names, and accuses her of not caring about the kids.\n\nSo, the question is whether the teacher is in the wrong. First, she's already giving her time for free to her students. She's not required to help students outside her school or district. The parent approached her asking for a favor, and she's saying she can't do it for free. She's charging because she's using her own time and energy after work. The parent's reaction is uncalled for, but the teacher's asking for compensation isn't really her fault. She's in a position where she's already giving a lot without pay. The parent might be in the wrong for expecting free help and reacting so harshly. The teacher isn't obligated to help, especially with her own responsibilities. So probably the answer is B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
