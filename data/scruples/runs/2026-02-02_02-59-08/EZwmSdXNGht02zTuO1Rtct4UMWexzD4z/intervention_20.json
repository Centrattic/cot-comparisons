The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not helping a student from another school. The situation involves a teacher who offers free tutoring after school, but when a parent from another school asks for help, the teacher charges $25 per session. The parent got upset, saying the teacher is in it for the money.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The teacher is in a low-income rural area and provides free tutoring, including snacks, which they pay for themselves. The parent from another school's child can't come during the regular tutoring time because of the school's dismissal time. The teacher offers to tutor but charges a fee, which the parent reacts negatively to.\n\nThe teacher's reasoning is that they can't stay past 4:15 because they get home too late and have their own child to help. The parent claims the teacher doesn't care about the kids and is selfish. The author feels hurt but thinks they're not in the wrong.\n\nSo, the main points are: free tutoring for their own students, willingness to help but with a time constraint, charging for extra time, and the parent's harsh reaction.\n\nIs the teacher in the wrong? Well, the teacher is already providing a service for free. When asked to extend beyond their capacity, they set boundaries. Charging a fee might be reasonable given the time and effort outside their normal schedule. However, the teacher's response might come off as cold, but considering their own limitations, maybe it's justified. The parent's reaction is extreme, but the teacher might have a right to say no or charge if they can't do it for free.\n\nAlternatively, some might argue that as a teacher, they should help regardless of payment. But the teacher isn't obligated to provide services beyond their school's students, especially when it's outside their contracted hours. The teacher is also balancing personal time and family responsibilities.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether charging for the service is acceptable. Since the teacher already works for free, charging a nominal fee for extra time isn't clearly wrong. The parent's accusations are unjustified, so the teacher isn't the asshole here. The answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
