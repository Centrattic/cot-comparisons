The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the teacher is in the wrong for not helping a student from another school. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the teacher is already offering free tutoring after school in a low-income area. They even provide snacks themselves. Then a parent from another school asks if the teacher can tutor her son, who is in a different county and has a later dismissal time. The teacher offered to tutor him separately but then set a fee of $25 per session. The parent got angry, called the teacher names, etc. The teacher is now wondering if they're an asshole.\n\nSo the main points are: the teacher was already doing a lot for free, the parent's child is in a different school and county, making timing an issue. The teacher asked for $25, which the parent took offense to. The teacher can't get to the child on time because of their own work and family responsibilities. \n\nI need to consider the ethics here. The teacher is within their rights to set boundaries. They can't be expected to offer free tutoring beyond their own students, especially when it's logistically impossible due to timing and their own commitments. Charging $25 is reasonable since the parent's area might have different resources. The teacher isn't obligated to help a student from another school, especially without reimbursement for their time. The parent's reaction is aggressive and unfair, attacking the teacher's motives. The teacher's decision to charge is to compensate for their time and energy, which is understandable. So, the teacher isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
