The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the question is whether the teacher is in the wrong for not tutoring the student from a different school. The user says they think the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate this.\n\nFirst, the teacher offers free tutoring to their own students. She's in a low-income area, pays for snacks, and does this after school. The parent of a student she's tutoring asks if she can also tutor her son, who's in a different county and school. The teacher initially agrees on the condition that the kid arrives on time. But when it's clear he can't make it until later, the teacher offers to tutor him for $25 per session. The parent gets angry and calls her names, accusing her of being selfish and only in it for money.\n\nSo the key points here: The teacher is providing a service outside her job, which is already unpaid. She's already committed to helping her own students, maybe even going beyond her duties. Now someone else's parent is asking her to take on another student, but the timing is an issue. The teacher isn't obligated to help, especially since the kid isn't in her school. She's trying to compensate for her time because she can't do it for free when it's after her own workday. The parent then gets angry about the fee.\n\nI need to consider if charging for that time is reasonable. Since tutoring the student would be outside her job responsibilities and after her own work hours, and considering the teacher isn't getting paid by the school for this, it's reasonable for her to ask for compensation. The parent's expectation might be that since she's a teacher, she should help for free, but that's not fair. Teachers aren't required to provide their services beyond their paid job. \n\nAlso, the teacher is dealing with personal responsibilities after work, like helping her own son. The parent's reaction is harsh, but the teacher isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries and charging for her time. She's already offering her time for free for her own students, but this new request would require additional time and effort. \n\nSo maybe the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong). She's protecting her own time and energy, and it's reasonable to charge for services not covered by her job. The parent's anger seems unwarranted. The teacher isn't obligated to help, especially under different circumstances. She's being fair by asking for compensation when it's beyond her initial offer.\n"
