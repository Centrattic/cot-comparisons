The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not helping a student from another school. The situation involves a teacher offering free tutoring to her own students but being asked by a parent from another school to tutor their child, which involves different logistics and time. The teacher offered to do it for $25 per session, but the parent was upset, calling her names and accusing her of being selfish.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The teacher provides free tutoring for her students, which she does out of her own time and pays for snacks. The parent of another student, whose child is in a different school and county, approached her. The teacher initially agreed but later realized the logistical challenges\u2014the other school lets out later, so the child would arrive after her own tutoring sessions. She offered to tutor the child separately for $25 per hour, which is below the local going rate. The parent reacted negatively, leading to the teacher questioning if she was wrong.\n\nThe main issue here is whether the teacher is in the wrong for setting boundaries and charging for her time. On one hand, the teacher is already giving her time and resources for free to her own students, which is commendable. She's in a low-economic area and the parents might not have the means to pay for tutors. On the other hand, the teacher has a legitimate need for rest after a long day, a commute, and helping her own son. She's not obligated to help another school's student, especially when it's not within her school's policy or her own time constraints. \n\nThe parent's reaction seems extreme. The teacher did offer to help but set a reasonable price, which is lower than the market rate. The parent's accusation that she's in it for money is unfair because she's already providing free tutoring. The teacher's decision to charge for the additional time makes sense, given that she's sacrificing personal time and energy. \n\nI should consider the policies of the district. The teacher mentioned that charging for tutoring her own students is a conflict of interest, but for another school's student, it might be allowed. However, the parent's hostility is misplaced. The teacher isn't obligated to take on extra work outside her commitments. So, the teacher isn't in the wrong here. She's setting boundaries, which is necessary for her well-being. The parent's actions were inappropriate, and the teacher's request for compensation is reasonable. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
