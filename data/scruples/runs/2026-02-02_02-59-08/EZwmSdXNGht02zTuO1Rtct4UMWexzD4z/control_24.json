The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the teacher is in the wrong for not helping a student from another school. The teacher already does free tutoring for her own students, providing snacks and spending her own time. Then another parent asks for tutoring, but the kid is in a different county and school, so timing is an issue. The teacher offers to do it for $25 per session, but the parent gets upset and calls her names.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The teacher is already giving her time and resources. She's in a low-income area, so she's doing this for free. She's not supposed to charge her own students because of conflict of interest. When the new parent asks, the teacher is being reasonable by asking for compensation because it would require her to stay late and then drive home later, affecting her personal time. The parent's reaction is pretty harsh, but the teacher is within her rights to set boundaries.\n\nThe key points here are: the teacher is already overextending herself, the new student's situation is logistically difficult, and the teacher is asking for fair pay for her time. The parent's accusations that the teacher is selfish or in it for money don't hold up since she's already giving free tutoring. The teacher isn't in the wrong for setting reasonable limits, especially considering her own time and well-being. So, the answer should be B.\n"
