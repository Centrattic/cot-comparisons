The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. The question is from an AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario, so I need to analyze the facts presented and determine if the author did something wrong.\n\nFirst, the author is a first-grade teacher in a rural, low-income area. They offer free tutoring after school for their own students, providing snacks they pay for themselves. The tutoring is 45 minutes after school ends at 2:40, starting at 2:50. \n\nThen, a parent from another school contacts the teacher, asking if they can tutor her son. The child is in a different county, about an hour away, and their school lets out 30 minutes later. The parent wants the teacher to adjust the tutoring time to accommodate the child arriving at 4:15. The teacher, who gets to work at 6:30 AM and has to help their own son with homework, is already exhausted by 4:15 PM. They offer to do the tutoring for $25 per session, which is below the local rate of $30/hour. The parent reacts angrily, calling the teacher names and accusing them of not caring about kids and being in it for money.\n\nThe author is questioning if they're in the wrong for not agreeing to tutor the boy for free and asking for compensation, leading to the parent's anger. The user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants the AI's opinion.\n\nSo, factors to consider: \n\n1. The teacher is already providing free tutoring for their own students, which is generous given their own circumstances. They're in a low-income area, so maybe the parent expected free help as well. But the child isn't the teacher's student; the teacher isn't obligated to help another school's student. \n\n2. The parent is asking for a significant time shift. The teacher's current schedule is already demanding, and adjusting to 4:15 PM would require staying much longer after work. The teacher mentions being out of energy by 4:15, and the commute home is about an hour. Also, they have their own son to help with homework, which is a valid personal responsibility.\n\n3. The teacher offered to tutor for $25/hour, which is actually a discount compared to the local $30 rate. The parent was upset about the cost, but the teacher isn't being unreasonable here. They're not asking for the market rate, but a lower amount, which shows they're still willing to help but need compensation for their time. \n\n4. The parent's reaction seems extreme and unprofessional. Accusing the teacher of being selfish and not caring about kids is harsh, especially since the teacher is already giving their time for free for other students. The parent might be projecting their own expectations onto the teacher without considering the teacher's capacity.\n\n5. The teacher isn't obligated to help another school's student. The tutoring is part of their voluntary commitment to their own students. The parent's son attends a different school, so the teacher isn't under any professional obligation to assist. The teacher's refusal to extend their services beyond their existing commitments isn't wrong.\n\n6. The teacher's request for compensation is reasonable given the time and energy required. They can't be expected to offer free services outside their current setup, especially when they're already sacrificing their time and money for their own students.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong. They provided a generous offer at a discounted rate, but the parent was unreasonable in their expectations and reaction. The teacher has limits and personal responsibilities, which they have the right to prioritize.\n"
