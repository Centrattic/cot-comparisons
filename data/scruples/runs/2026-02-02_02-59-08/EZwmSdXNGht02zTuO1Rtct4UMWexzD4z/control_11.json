The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the teacher is in the wrong for not tutoring the student from another school. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the teacher already offers free tutoring after school for her own students. She provides snacks and does this for forty-five minutes right after school ends. The parent from another school asks if she can tutor their child, but the child is in a different county, an hour away, and their school dismisses later. So the timing doesn't work with the teacher's current schedule.\n\nThe teacher is already giving her time for free to her own students. If she takes on this other student, it would require her to stay an extra hour and a half after school, which she's not physically able to do because she gets home late and has her own son to take care of. She offers to do it for $25 per session, which is below the local tutor rate. The parent gets angry and calls her names, accusing her of not caring and being selfish.\n\nNow, the teacher is asking if she's an asshole for not helping. The key points here: she's already providing free tutoring, which is a generous gesture. She's not obligated to help another school's student, especially when it's a logistical nightmare. The parent expected her to take on more without compensation, which isn't unreasonable, but the teacher is clearly overburdened. The fact that she offered a reduced rate shows she's trying to help but can't do it for free. The parent's reaction is extreme and unfair, attacking her character.\n\nSo, the teacher isn't in the wrong. She's already doing a lot for her own students. The parent's expectations were unreasonable given the circumstances. The answer should be B, the teacher is not in the wrong.\n"
