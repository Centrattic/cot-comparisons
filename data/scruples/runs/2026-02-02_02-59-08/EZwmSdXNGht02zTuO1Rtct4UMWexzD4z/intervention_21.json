The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the teacher is in the wrong here. The situation is about whether the teacher should offer free tutoring to a student from another school.\n\nFirst, the teacher already offers free tutoring to her own students, which she pays for herself. That's generous. Then another parent approaches, asking for tutoring for her son who's in a different school. The teacher agrees to help if the student can make it on time. But the student can't because of the school's dismissal time. The parent then asks if the teacher can wait until the student arrives later. The teacher is tired by 4:15 PM and has her own son to take care of. She offers to tutor for $25 per session. The parent gets angry and accuses her of not caring about kids and being greedy.\n\nSo, the teacher's main points are: she's already doing free tutoring, she's under personal time constraints, and she's offering to be paid for the extra time. The parent is upset because they expected free help, even though the student isn't one of hers. \n\nNow, the teacher isn't obligated to help another school's student. Her time is limited, especially after a long day. Charging the market rate for the tutoring time makes sense here because she's offering her own time beyond her normal work hours. The parent's reaction is extreme and unfair because they didn't have any right to expect free services outside the teacher's own responsibilities. The teacher isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries and asking for compensation for her time. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
