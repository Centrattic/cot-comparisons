The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The teacher is offering free tutoring to her own students, which is commendable and shows dedication. She's already doing this for her class, and she's even providing snacks herself. Now, a parent from another school asks if she can tutor their son, who's in a different county and school. The timing doesn't work because the other school lets out later, so the kid can't make the after-school session.\n\nThe teacher then offers to tutor the other kid separately, but when discussing payment, she asks for $25 per session. The parent reacts negatively, leading to the teacher feeling hurt and questioning if she's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the teacher is not obligated to help other students outside her school. She's already providing free tutoring for her own students, which is a generous act. The other parent's son isn't her student, so there's no professional responsibility there. The teacher probably had good intentions but realized the logistical challenges\u2014energy levels, time to get home, and helping her own child. \n\nAsking for payment is reasonable. She's giving up personal time, which she might not have due to her own family responsibilities. The parent's reaction was harsh and unfair, but the teacher isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries. She's not obligated to help everyone, especially when it's not feasible. The teacher's decision to charge is justified because her time is valuable, and she's not being compensated for the free tutoring she's already providing. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. She's maintaining her own well-being and setting appropriate boundaries. The parent's anger stems from unmet expectations, but the teacher isn't required to accommodate all requests, especially those outside her school's scope. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
