The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The teacher is in a low-income rural area and offers free tutoring to her own students after school. She provides snacks and spends her own time. Then, a parent from another school (different county) asks if she can tutor their child who has terrible reading skills. The catch is the child's school ends 30 minutes later, so getting them there by the usual tutoring time isn't possible. The parent wants the teacher to adjust her schedule.\n\nThe teacher offers to do a separate session but starts to feel like she can't do it because she's already exhausted by 4:15 PM. She mentions she has her own son's homework to help with, a 40-minute drive home, and that she's not getting paid for this. So she asks for $25 per hour, which is below the local rate. The parent gets angry, calls her names, and accuses her of not caring about kids. The teacher is now questioning if she's an asshole for not helping.\n\nSo, is she in the wrong? Well, she's already taking time to tutor her own students for free, using her own energy and resources. She's not obligated to help another student from a different school district, especially when it's not feasible with her schedule. The parent's child is in a different school, so maybe the parent should seek other resources. The teacher isn't at fault for setting boundaries here. She's even offered to help when she can, but the circumstances make it impossible without compensation. Asking for a fair rate for her time isn't unreasonable, especially since she's working long hours and has her own family responsibilities. The parent's reaction seems over the top. So the answer is B.\n"
