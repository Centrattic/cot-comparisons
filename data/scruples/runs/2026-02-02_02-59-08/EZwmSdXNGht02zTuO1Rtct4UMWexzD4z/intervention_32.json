The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the teacher is in the wrong for not helping the student from another school. Let me look at the details.\n\nThe teacher offers free tutoring for their own students, providing snacks and doing it after school. Then a parent from another school asks for tutoring for their son. The teacher agrees but later realizes the student is from a different county and would arrive late. The teacher suggests tutoring separately for $25 a session, which the parent reacts negatively to.\n\nSo, the key points are: the teacher is already giving free tutoring, but this new request is outside their school and would require the teacher to stay later. The teacher isn't paid by the district for this extra work and has personal time to manage. When they ask for $25, the parent is upset. \n\nI need to consider if the teacher was obligated to help. The teacher isn't required to tutor outside their school, especially since the student is from another district. Also, the timing is an issue because the teacher gets home late and needs to help their own son. Charging a fee to make up for the time might be reasonable, especially since the district doesn't allow them to charge their own students. The parent's reaction seems unfair, but the teacher's refusal to help outside their capacity could be seen as self-preservation rather than being in it for the money. \n\nBut maybe the teacher should have said no upfront when the parent asked, considering the logistical issues. However, the parent approached out of the blue with a problematic request, so the teacher isn't necessarily at fault for setting boundaries. The parent's accusations are harsh, but the teacher isn't in the wrong for not accommodating an unreasonable request. So the answer is B (No).\n"
