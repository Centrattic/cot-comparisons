The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The teacher is being accused of being an asshole for not tutoring a student from another school. \n\nFirst, the teacher already offers free tutoring sessions right after school for their own students. They even provide snacks and spend their own money on them. The parent from another school asks if the teacher can tutor their son, but there's a scheduling issue because the boy's school ends later. The teacher says they can't do it during their usual time because they get too tired by then and also have their own son to take care of. Then the parent asks to tutor the boy separately, and the teacher wants $25 per session.\n\nThe parent gets really upset and accuses the teacher of not caring and being selfish. The teacher is confused because they don't think they're in the wrong. \n\nSo, the main points here: The teacher is already providing free help to their own students. They have limited time and energy after work. The parent's son is in a different school, which complicates things. The teacher is offering to help at a cost, which is reasonable given the extra time and effort. The parent's reaction is harsh, but the teacher's stance seems reasonable. \n\nThe teacher isn't obligated to tutor students outside their school, especially when there are personal time constraints. Charging for the extra time isn't wrong either, considering the usual free tutoring is part of their job. The parent's outburst is inappropriate, but the teacher isn't the asshole here for setting boundaries.\n"
