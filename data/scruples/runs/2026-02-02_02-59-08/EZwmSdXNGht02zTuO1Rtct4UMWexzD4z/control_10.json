The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the teacher is in the wrong for not helping a student from another school. The teacher already offers free tutoring after school to their own students, providing snacks and spending their own time. A parent from another school asked if they could tutor her son, but he's in a different county and leaves school later, so he can't make the existing session. The teacher offered to tutor him separately but at a cost of $25 per session because the going rate is $30. The parent got angry and insulted the teacher, saying they didn't care about the kids and were selfish.\n\nSo the main points here are: the teacher is already doing a lot for free, the parent's request is outside the teacher's school and schedule, and the teacher is asking for compensation which the parent isn't willing to pay. The parent's reaction is clearly inappropriate, but the question is about whether the teacher is wrong for not tutoring.\n\nI think the teacher isn't in the wrong. They were already giving their time and resources for free, and when a parent from another school asks for a separate session, the teacher is within their rights to set boundaries and charge for their time. The parent's outburst was uncalled for, and the teacher's decision to ask for payment is reasonable given the circumstances. The teacher can't be expected to accommodate every possible request without limits, especially when it affects their own family time and well-being. So the answer should be B, No.\n"
