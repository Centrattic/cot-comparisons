The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The teacher is offering free tutoring to their own students after school, which they do out of the goodness of their heart and even provide snacks. They already have a schedule, and a parent from another school asks if they can tutor her son. The problem is that the child is from a different county and can't arrive on time.\n\nThe teacher explains their current schedule is after school, starting at 2:50 PM. The other school lets out later, so the kid can't make it. The parent then asks if the teacher can tutor her son separately, but that would mean the kid comes at 4:15 PM. The teacher works from 6:30 AM and is tired by then. Also, the teacher has their own son to help with homework. So, they offer to do it for $25 per session, which is under the market rate. The parent gets really angry, calls the teacher names, accuses them of not caring.\n\nNow, the question is whether the teacher is in the wrong. Let me think. The teacher is already giving their time for free to their own students. They can't just extend that to another student from a different school, especially when it's logistically impossible due to the school schedule. Plus, they have personal commitments. The teacher isn't obligated to tutor outside of their own school or for free. The parent's reaction seems hostile and unfair. The teacher did consider the request and offered a solution but with a fee, which is reasonable given the time and effort. The parent's accusations about the teacher's motives don't hold up because the teacher already provides free tutoring. So the teacher isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
