The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author (the teacher) is in the wrong for not helping a student by offering paid tutoring. \n\nFirst, the context: The teacher already provides free tutoring for their own students after school, using their own time and money for snacks. A parent from another school (different county) asks if the teacher can tutor her son, who's in a different school and has a later dismissal time. The teacher offers to tutor if the parent can get the kid there on time, which she can't. Then the parent asks if the teacher can tutor the child separately at a later time. The teacher says they can't because they're too tired and have other commitments, and offers to do it for $25 per session. The parent gets angry and calls the teacher names.\n\nSo the core issue is whether the teacher was wrong to ask for compensation. The teacher is already doing free tutoring for their own students, which is unpaid and out of their own pocket. The new request is for a student from a different school, which isn't the teacher's responsibility. The teacher offers to do it but wants to be paid since it's outside their normal unpaid tutoring. \n\nThe parent might not understand that the teacher can't just extend their unpaid hours indefinitely, especially since they have their own family to take care of. The teacher's job is already demanding, and they're in a rural, low-economic area where resources might be stretched. \n\nBut the parent's child needs help, and the teacher is a professional who can provide that help. However, the teacher isn't obligated to work extra hours for free. The teacher is within their rights to ask for compensation for their time, especially since it's outside their current commitments. \n\nThe parent's reaction is clearly inappropriate, but the teacher's decision to charge is understandable. The key here is that the teacher is not in the wrong for not providing free tutoring beyond what they've already agreed to. They are not responsible for students outside their school, and they have valid reasons for not working late without compensation. \n\nSo the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
