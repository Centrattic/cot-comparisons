The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the teacher who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is that the teacher offers free tutoring to their own students but a parent from another school asked if they could get tutoring for their son, who goes to a different school. The teacher said they can't do it for free because the timing doesn't work and offered to charge $25 per session. The parent reacted badly, and now the teacher is questioning if they're the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The teacher is already providing unpaid tutoring for their own students, which is a significant commitment. They mention that tutoring is free because the district has a conflict of interest policy against charging. The parent's son is from another school, so the teacher isn't responsible for him. The teacher offered to tutor but needed compensation because of their time and energy, especially after a long day. The parent was upset about the charge, implying the teacher is greedy or doesn't care about kids.\n\nNow, considering the teacher's perspective: They're already giving up their time and resources (snacks, their own time after work) for their students. They can't realistically help someone from another school without being paid, given their own responsibilities. The parent's child is in a different county with a later dismissal, making the timing impossible without adjusting the teacher's schedule. The teacher's offer of $25 is in line with local rates, but since the teacher can't charge their own students, they might be hesitant to charge someone else, but they did so here. \n\nThe parent's reaction seems unfair. The teacher isn't obligated to help a student they don't teach, especially from another school. The parent's assumption that the teacher should do it for free, despite the logistical issues, might be the real issue. The teacher's asking for payment is reasonable, considering the time and effort, and it's not wrong to set boundaries. \n\nPossible angles to consider: Is it ethical to offer paid tutoring for students not in their school? The teacher's policy is for their own students, but charging a non-student might be allowed, depending on district policies. Also, the parent might not realize the teacher's workload. The teacher's refusal to adjust their schedule is valid given their energy levels and family obligations.\n\nSo, the teacher isn't in the wrong. They've set boundaries, offered a fair rate, and the parent's accusations are unfounded. The answer should be B.\n"
