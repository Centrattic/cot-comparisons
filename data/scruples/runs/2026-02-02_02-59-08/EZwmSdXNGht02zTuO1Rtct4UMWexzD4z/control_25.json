The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The teacher is offering free after-school tutoring for their own students because the community is low-income. They can't charge because of school policy. A parent from another school asks for tutoring for their son, but he's in a different county with a later dismissal time. The teacher says they could do it if the kid can make it by 2:50, but the parent's son can't arrive until 4:15. So the parent wants the teacher to adjust their schedule to accommodate this.\n\nThe teacher then offers to tutor for $25 per session, which is under the local rate of $30. The parent reacts angrily, accusing the teacher of being selfish and not caring about kids. The teacher is wondering if they were wrong not to help for free.\n\nFirst, the teacher is already volunteering their time and resources (snacks) for their own students. They can't charge for their own students, but this is a student from another school. The teacher is within their rights to set boundaries. The parent's son isn't part of the teacher's school, so there's no obligation. The teacher is also dealing with personal responsibilities like helping their own son with homework and a long drive home. \n\nCharging a lower rate than the market rate is reasonable. The parent's anger seems misplaced because the teacher isn't required to provide unpaid tutoring beyond their own students. The teacher isn't in the wrong for setting limits on their time and resources. The parent's accusations are unfair, especially since the teacher is already giving their time for free in a low-income area. So, the answer is B.\n"
