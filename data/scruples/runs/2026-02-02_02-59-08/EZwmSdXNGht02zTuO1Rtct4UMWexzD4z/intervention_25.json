The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the teacher (the author) is in the wrong for not helping another student who's from a different school. \n\nFirst, the situation: The teacher tutors her own students for free after school, providing snacks. A parent from another school asks the teacher to tutor her son, who is in a different county and a different school. The parent's son can't make the existing tutoring time, so she wants the teacher to adjust her schedule, which would mean the teacher has to stay till 4:15 PM and then drive home, which would take her until 5:45 PM. Also, the teacher has to help her own son with homework. She charges $25 per session for this extra time, but the parent gets angry and insults her.\n\nThe user thinks the teacher is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate. \n\nThe key points here are the teacher's obligations. She's already volunteering her time for her own students, which is commendable. The parent is asking for something outside of that\u2014tutoring a student from another school. The teacher isn't required to do this. She's already stretched thin, with her own responsibilities (her son's homework, her energy levels after a day's work). Charging for this extra service seems reasonable since she's not allowed to charge for her current tutoring (due to conflict of interest). The parent might not have considered the teacher's personal time and the fact that the student isn't even in her school. \n\nThe teacher's refusal isn't about the child's need but about the practicality and her own circumstances. The parent's outburst was uncalled for, but the teacher didn't have an obligation to help. So, the teacher isn't in the wrong for saying no and asking for compensation for her time beyond her existing commitments. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
