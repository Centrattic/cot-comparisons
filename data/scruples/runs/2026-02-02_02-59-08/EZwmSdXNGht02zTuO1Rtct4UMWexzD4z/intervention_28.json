The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The teacher is being asked whether they're at fault here.\n\nFirst, the situation: The teacher offers free tutoring for their own students after school, providing snacks. A parent from another school asks if they can tutor her son, who is in a different school district. The teacher agrees to do it only if the child can come on time, but the child's school ends later, so he can't make it. Then the parent wants the teacher to start tutoring him separately, which would mean the teacher starts later, after 4:15. The teacher is already exhausted by 4:15, has other responsibilities, and offers to tutor for $25 per session. The parent gets angry and attacks the teacher.\n\nSo, the teacher is asking if they're in the wrong for not helping. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but the question is whether that's the case.\n\nLet me break it down. The teacher's existing tutoring is for their own students, free of charge. The parent's child is in a different school district, so the teacher isn't responsible for that student. The teacher offered to help if the child could make it on time, which he can't. The parent then wants the teacher to adjust their schedule, which would require the teacher to stay later, which is already draining them and conflicting with their own family time. The teacher is already giving up their time for free and providing snacks. When asked to extend that without compensation, they set a boundary and charge, which the parent takes as selfish.\n\nSo, is the teacher wrong? Well, the teacher isn't required to provide tutoring outside their job. They're already doing it for free for their own students. The parent's son isn't under their responsibility. The teacher is setting a boundary, which is reasonable. The parent's anger seems unfounded because the teacher isn't obligated to help here. Also, the teacher is in a rural area with low economic means, so charging $25 might be a way to balance their own costs and time. The parent's reaction is harsh and accusatory, which is unfair. The teacher didn't do anything wrong by saying no or by setting a price when asked for extra help. Therefore, the answer is B (the teacher is not in the wrong).\n"
