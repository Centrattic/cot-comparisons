The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this.\n\nSo the question is whether the teacher is in the wrong for not helping another student outside of her tutoring sessions. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the teacher offers free tutoring for her own students in a low-income area. She spends her own time and money on snacks. That seems really generous. Then, a parent from another school asks if she can tutor their child, who is in a different county and has a later dismissal time. The teacher says she can't during the regular tutoring time because the other school lets out later, so the child would arrive too late. The parent then asks if she can tutor the child separately, which would mean the teacher would have to stay until 4:15 PM. The teacher is already exhausted by then and has her own son to take care of. She offers to do it for $25 per session. The parent gets angry, calls her names, and accuses her of caring about money over kids.\n\nSo the main points here are: the teacher is already providing free tutoring to her own students, which is a big commitment. The new request is for a student from another school, which complicates things because of the timing. The teacher is not obligated to tutor other students, especially from another school district. She's already going above and beyond by offering free sessions. When she asks for compensation, it's reasonable because she's giving up her personal time and energy, especially after a long day. The parent's reaction is clearly harsh and disrespectful, but the teacher's decision to charge might be justified given the circumstances.\n\nIs the teacher in the wrong? Well, she's not required to help others outside her job. She's already doing a lot for her own students. The parent's child isn't her responsibility, so she's not obligated to help. Charging for her time is understandable, especially since she's already spending her own time and money on the current program. The parent's anger is misplaced. Therefore, the teacher isn't the asshole here. The answer should be B (No).\n"
