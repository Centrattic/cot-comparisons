The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the teacher is in the wrong for not helping a student from a different school. The teacher already offers free tutoring to their own students, which is commendable. They provide snacks themselves and do it for 45 minutes after school.\n\nThe parent from another school approached the teacher, wanting their son tutored too. The issue is that the boy is in a different county and school, which ends later. The teacher offered to help if the kid could come on time, but the parent's son can't arrive until 4:15, which is way after the teacher's usual tutoring time. The teacher's workday starts at 6:30 AM, and by 4:15 PM, they're already exhausted. Plus, they have to drive home, help their own son with homework, etc. So, the teacher asks for $25 per session, which is less than the local rate.\n\nThe parent reacted angrily, calling the teacher names and accusing them of caring only about money. The teacher is now doubting if they're an asshole for not helping.\n\nHmm. The main points are: the teacher is already providing free service to their own students, and the new student is outside their responsibility. The teacher has personal time and family obligations. They offered to help but set boundaries when it's not feasible. The parent expected free help without considering the teacher's time. \n\nI think the teacher isn't in the wrong. They offered to help but couldn't accommodate due to time constraints and personal life. It's reasonable to ask for compensation if they're going to adjust their schedule. The parent was unreasonable. So answer B.\n"
