The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the teacher (the author) is in the wrong for not helping a student from another school. \n\nFirst, the teacher already offers free tutoring for her own students, which is generous. The parent from another school asked for help, but the timing was impossible because the other school dismisses later. The teacher offered to tutor the child separately but set a fee of $25, which is below the local rate. The parent got angry, called the teacher names, and accused her of being selfish and in it for money.\n\nSo, the teacher is in a rural, low-income area. She provides free snacks, spends her own time after school, and even pays for snacks. She's already giving her time without charge. When asked to extend that to a student from another school with different hours, she's not in a position to do so without compensation. The parent then reacts negatively, implying that the teacher is uncaring.\n\nThe key points: The teacher's offer is free for her own students. The other parent's child can't fit into the existing schedule. The teacher is willing to help but can't do it for free and asks a reasonable fee (under market rate). The parent's reaction is unprofessional and harsh. \n\nIs the teacher wrong for not helping without charging? Well, she can't be expected to give up more of her time and energy without some form of compensation, especially when it's outside her already free service. The parent's demands are unreasonable given the circumstances. The teacher isn't obligated to help a student outside her school district, especially when it would require her to work later and cut into her personal time. \n\nThe parent's anger seems misplaced. The teacher is already giving a lot. The fee is a fair request to balance her time and needs. The parent's accusations are untrue and unfair. So, the teacher isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
