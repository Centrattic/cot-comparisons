The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The teacher is in a rural, low-income area and offers free tutoring after school. They have their own kid to help with homework, which adds to their time constraints. A parent from another school asks for tutoring for her son, who's in a different county and can't get there on time. The teacher offers to tutor separately but sets a fee of $25, which is under the local rate. The parent reacts angrily, calling the teacher harsh names and accusing them of not caring about kids.\n\nThe user is asking if the teacher is in the wrong. The teacher is already giving free tutoring to students from their own school, which is commendable. The new parent's son is from a different school and county, making timing impossible. The teacher is clearly overburdened with work and family responsibilities. Charging a fee here makes sense, especially since the parent is asking for a service outside the teacher's existing commitments. The parent's reaction seems out of proportion and disrespectful. \n\nThe teacher isn't obligated to provide free services beyond their own students. They have a right to set boundaries and charge for their time, especially when it's outside their normal duties. The parent's assumption that the teacher should do it for free or face being called an asshole is unfair. The teacher is not in the wrong here for setting limits and asking for compensation for their time. So the answer should be B, the teacher isn't in the wrong.\n"
