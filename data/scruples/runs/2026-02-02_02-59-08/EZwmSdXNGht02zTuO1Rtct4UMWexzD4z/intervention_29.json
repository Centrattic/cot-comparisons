The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the teacher is in the wrong for not helping a student from another school. The situation is that the teacher offers free tutoring after school for their own students, but a parent from another school asked if they could tutor their son, who's in a different county and arrives later. The teacher offered to do it for $25 per session, which led to the parent getting angry and calling them names.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the teacher's perspective. They're already doing free tutoring for their own students, which they pay for themselves (snacks, time, etc.). They have a strict schedule, and the new student would arrive an hour and a half later. The teacher probably has limited time and energy, especially since they also have their own child's homework to handle. The teacher isn't obligated to tutor outside of their school or for other students, and they mentioned that charging isn't allowed for their own students, so asking for $25 might be their way of compensating for the extra time and effort here.\n\nOn the other hand, the parent is in a difficult economic situation, as the area is low-income. The parent's son is struggling academically, and they reached out for help. The teacher's offer to tutor for $25 might be considered reasonable, but the parent could see it as an obstacle when they can't afford it. However, the teacher isn't at fault for setting boundaries. They were already giving their time for free for others, and the parent's anger seems misplaced because the teacher isn't required to help outside their responsibilities.\n\nThe key points are: the teacher is within their rights to say no, especially since it's outside their school's policy and their personal time. They offered a solution (paid tutoring) which the parent couldn't accept, leading to the conflict. The parent's reaction was hostile, but the teacher isn't in the wrong for prioritizing their own capacity and asking for compensation for extra work. So the answer would be B, the teacher isn't in the wrong.\n"
