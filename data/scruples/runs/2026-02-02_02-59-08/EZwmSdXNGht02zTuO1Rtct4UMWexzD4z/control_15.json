The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the teacher in the scenario is in the wrong for not tutoring the student. So, the teacher already provides free tutoring for their own students, which is commendable. The parent of a student from another school (different county) contacts the teacher, asking for help. The teacher offers to do it for $25 per session, which the parent is upset about.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The teacher is in a low-economic area and already gives free tutoring. They can't charge their own students due to conflict of interest. The other parent's son is in a different school, which is an hour away. The timing doesn't work because the other school dismisses later. The teacher is already exhausted by 4:15 PM and has her own son to help with homework. So, the teacher's time is limited, and she's offering a fair rate compared to the local going rate of $30.\n\nThe parent reacts angrily, accusing the teacher of not caring and being selfish. But the teacher's argument is that she's already giving her time for free to others, and doing this extra would take a toll on her. Charging a reasonable fee is a way to compensate for her time, which is understandable. The teacher isn't obligated to help outside her current commitments. The parent's son is in a different school, so maybe the teacher isn't responsible for him. The teacher's boundaries are valid here. She's not in the wrong for setting limits and asking for fair compensation for additional work. The parent's reaction is more inconsiderate, but the teacher's decision is justified. So, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
