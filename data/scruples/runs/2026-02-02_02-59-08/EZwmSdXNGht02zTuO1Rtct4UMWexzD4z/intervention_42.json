The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the teacher is in the wrong for not helping another student from a different school. The teacher already offers free tutoring for their own students, which they fund themselves, including snacks. Then a parent from another school approaches them, asking for their son to be tutored. The teacher agrees only if the kid can make it on time, but he can't. The parent then asks for a separate session, which would require the teacher to stay later. The teacher offers to do it for $25, which is below the local rate. The parent gets angry and insults the teacher.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know my opinion. Let's break it down. The teacher is already providing free tutoring, which is commendable. They set boundaries about time because of their own personal commitments. The parent's request is for a student from a different school, which isn't part of the teacher's usual responsibility. The teacher is not obligated to help another school's student, especially when it conflicts with their own time and energy. However, the teacher offered to help if the child could attend the existing session. When that wasn't possible, they proposed a different arrangement with a fee. The parent took offense, but the teacher is within their rights to set boundaries and charge for their time, especially since they're already spending personal time and money on the existing program.\n\nIs the teacher in the wrong? They didn't force the parent to agree to the terms. They offered help under certain conditions, and when those couldn't be met, they proposed an alternative. Charging a lower rate than the market price shows they're not trying to exploit. The parent's anger might stem from unmet expectations about public service, but the teacher isn't required to work beyond their set hours or personal capacity. Therefore, the teacher isn't in the wrong for not helping further.\n"
