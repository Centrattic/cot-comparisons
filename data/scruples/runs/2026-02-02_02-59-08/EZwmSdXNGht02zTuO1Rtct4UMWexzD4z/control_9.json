The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the teacher is in the wrong here. The situation is about whether she should have offered to tutor a student from another school district even though she's already tutoring her own students for free.\n\nFirst, the teacher is already providing free tutoring sessions for her own students. She pays for snacks and spends her time after school. So she's already going above and beyond her job. Now, a parent from another school asks her to tutor their child. The problem is that the other child's school ends later and the parent can't get the child to the teacher's school on time. The teacher is considering offering one-on-one tutoring for this child, but not for free. She asks for $25 per session because she's already exhausted by 4:15 PM and needs to get home to help her own son.\n\nThe parent reacts negatively, calling her names and accusing her of not caring about the kids and being selfish. The teacher is hurt and wants to know if she's the asshole for not helping.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the teacher is already doing a lot for her own students without compensation. She's being asked to take on more work that's not part of her job, especially for a student not in her school. She's offering to do it for a fee, which is reasonable given the time and effort, but that's seen as selfish. However, the teacher has her own responsibilities and limits. She can't be expected to work beyond her capacity without compensation, especially in a low-economic area where she might not have the resources to give more for free.\n\nThe parent's reaction seems unreasonable because the teacher is not obligated to help outside her job. The teacher is within her rights to set boundaries and charge for her time when it's not part of her professional duties. The parent's insults are invalid because the teacher isn't in the wrong here. So the answer should be B, the teacher is not in the wrong.\n"
