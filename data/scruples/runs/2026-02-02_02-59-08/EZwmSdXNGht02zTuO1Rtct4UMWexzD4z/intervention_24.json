The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the teacher (the author) is in the wrong for not helping a student from another school. The teacher offers free tutoring to their own students but is approached by a parent from another school whose child is struggling. The parent asks for help, but the logistics are tough because the child is in a different county and leaves school later. The teacher initially agrees to tutor if the child can make it on time, but when the parent can't, the teacher offers to tutor separately but charges $25 per session. The parent gets upset, calls the teacher names, and accuses them of being in it for the money.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is wrong for not tutoring. The user thinks the author is wrong, but I need to decide. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the teacher's existing arrangement: free tutoring for their own students after school. They provide snacks, pay for them themselves. That's generous. Now, the parent from another school asks for help. The teacher is already stretched, given their own workload and family responsibilities. The new student can't come at the same time, so the teacher offers to do it separately for a fee. The parent is upset because they expected free help, perhaps?\n\nThe teacher is in a rural, low-income area. Charging $25 might be a lot for some families. But the teacher can't do it for free because they have their own time and energy to manage. The parent's reaction is harsh. But is the teacher wrong?\n\nWell, the teacher isn't obligated to tutor outside their school. They were helping one student from another school (the best friend's daughter) but that's within their own student base. Now, a new student from another school. The teacher can set their own boundaries. Charging for the time is reasonable since they're not getting paid for this extra work. The parent might not have expected a fee, but the teacher isn't required to volunteer their time beyond what they already do. The teacher's reasons are practical\u2014energy after a long day, family responsibilities. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. The parent's reaction is unwarranted. The teacher isn't obligated to tutor another school's student for free. Charging for the time is acceptable, especially when they're already giving their time for free to their own students. The parent's insult is the real issue here, not the teacher's decision to charge or not tutor. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
