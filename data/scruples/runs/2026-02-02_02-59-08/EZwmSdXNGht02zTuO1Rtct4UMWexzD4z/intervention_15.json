The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the teacher (author) is in the wrong for not helping a student from another school. The parent was upset because the teacher offered free tutoring to her friend's child but then charged when the parent wanted tutoring for her own child, even though the timing didn't work.\n\nFirst, the teacher is already providing free tutoring sessions for their own students. The parent from another school approached asking for tutoring for their child, who is in a different county and school. The teacher offered to do it if the child could come on time, but the parent's child couldn't make it due to the later dismissal. So the teacher suggested a different time but then asked for $25 per session. The parent got angry and accused the teacher of being selfish and money-driven.\n\nThe teacher is in a rural, low-income area and can't charge their own students due to conflict of interest. They pay for snacks themselves. The parent's child is in a different school, so the teacher isn't obligated to help them. Charging $25 is below the going rate of $30, so the teacher is being reasonable. The parent seems to have unrealistic expectations, thinking the teacher should provide free tutoring for their child as well, even though it's a different school and the teacher has personal time and energy constraints.\n\nThe teacher's main duty is to their own students and their own family. The parent's child isn't under the teacher's responsibility. The teacher isn't at fault for setting boundaries and asking for compensation for their time, especially since they already give their time for free to their own students. The parent's reaction was unreasonable and disrespectful. Therefore, the teacher is not in the wrong.\n"
