The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The teacher is in a rural, low-income area and offers free after-school tutoring. They provide snacks and tutor for free. A parent from another school asks if the teacher can tutor their son, who is in a different county and has a later dismissal. The teacher says they can't tutor at the regular time but offers to do it separately if the child comes later. However, the teacher is already exhausted by 4:15 PM after working until 2:40 PM, driving home, and helping their own son with homework. They set a fee of $25 per session, which the parent took very badly, leading to insults.\n\nFirst, the teacher is already giving their time for free, which is generous. The parent's son is in a different district with different schedules, so the initial offer wasn't feasible. The teacher, after working long hours, can't handle an extra session without compensation. Charging $25 is reasonable, considering the local rate is $30. But the teacher is in a position where they can't ethically charge their own students, so they set a lower rate. However, the parent reacts negatively, implying the teacher is selfish. \n\nIs the teacher wrong for charging? They had to spend their own time and energy, which isn't feasible without compensation. The teacher isn't obligated to help outside their school or district. The parent's reaction seems unfair because the teacher is already giving their time for free in the first place. The teacher's limits are reasonable, especially considering their workload and personal time. So the answer is B\u2014they're not in the wrong.\n"
