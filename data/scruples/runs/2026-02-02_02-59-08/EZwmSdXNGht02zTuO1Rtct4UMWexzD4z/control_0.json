The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the teacher is wrong for not helping a student from another school by tutoring them, especially after the parent got upset when the teacher asked for compensation.\n\nFirst, the teacher already offers free tutoring sessions for their own students. They can't charge, so they do it for free and even pay for snacks. That shows dedication and a willingness to help without expecting money. \n\nThen, a parent from another school asks for help. The teacher agrees to help if the child can make it on time, but the child can't. The parent then asks the teacher to wait for the other child, which would require the teacher to stay until 4:15. But by that time, the teacher is already tired from work, has to help their own son, and driving home would take a while. So the teacher offers $25 per session as compensation. \n\nThe parent reacts angrily, accusing the teacher of being selfish and caring only for money. The teacher is now questioning if they did the right thing by not offering free tutoring beyond their current commitment.\n\nSo, considering the circumstances: the teacher is already giving their time for free, has limited capacity, and has personal responsibilities. Asking for a fee when there's a time conflict and personal strain seems reasonable. The parent's outburst is unreasonable, especially given the free services the teacher already provides. The teacher isn't obligated to tutor outside their own school, especially when it's not feasible. Therefore, the teacher isn't in the wrong here.\n"
