The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking whether the teacher is in the wrong for not helping a student from another school. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nFirst, the teacher is in a rural, low-economic area and offers free tutoring sessions after school. These sessions are funded by the teacher's own time and money, including snacks. They mention that they can't charge their own students because of conflict of interest rules. \n\nThen, a parent from another school contacts the teacher, asking if they can tutor her son. The teacher agrees on the condition that the child arrives on time, but it turns out the child's school ends later, making it impossible. The parent then asks if the teacher can adjust their schedule to accommodate, which would mean tutoring the child later in the day. The teacher is already tired by 4:15 PM and has other responsibilities, like helping their own son with homework. So, the teacher offers to do it for $25 per session. The parent reacts negatively, calling the teacher names and accusing them of caring only about money.\n\nThe teacher is now questioning if they were wrong to ask for compensation. The user wants to know if the teacher is the asshole here. The options are A (Yes) or B (No).\n\nHmm. So, the key points here are the teacher's existing commitments, the ethical implications of charging, and the parent's reaction. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the teacher is already providing free tutoring for their own students, which is a generous gesture. They can't charge those students, which is why they mention the $30 going rate locally. When a parent from another school asks for help, the teacher is in a position where they can't use the existing free sessions because the child is from another school. That's probably a key point. If the teacher could include the child in their existing free sessions, maybe that's a different scenario, but since the timing doesn't work, the teacher is considering offering a separate session.\n\nThe teacher mentions that they are exhausted by 4:15 PM and have other responsibilities. So, their main concern is their own capacity. They're not obligated to tutor beyond their own students, especially in a different county. The parent might have expected the teacher to handle this without compensation, but the teacher is just human and needs to prioritize their own time and energy.\n\nThen, the teacher sets a rate of $25 per session, which is below the local rate. The parent's reaction is harsh, but the teacher's reasoning is that they can't afford to give up their own time for free, especially after already giving so much. \n\nIs it wrong to ask for compensation? Well, the teacher isn't obligated to tutor at all. They already do a lot for their own students. The fact that the parent is angry about the fee might be because they expected the teacher to do it for free, but the teacher has their own limits. \n\nAnother angle: the parent reached out out of the blue, maybe expecting the teacher to accommodate without considering the teacher's schedule or workload. The teacher's refusal isn't because they don't care but because they can't physically manage more. Charging a fee is a way to set boundaries, which is reasonable.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that teachers should be altruistic, but that's not realistic. People need to balance their own lives and can't be expected to help everyone without limits. The teacher is in a position of privilege compared to the students, but the parent is in a different school district, which might complicate things further.\n\nIn conclusion, the teacher had valid reasons for not being able to adjust their schedule and setting a fee. The parent's reaction is inappropriate, but the teacher isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries. So the answer is B (No).\n"
