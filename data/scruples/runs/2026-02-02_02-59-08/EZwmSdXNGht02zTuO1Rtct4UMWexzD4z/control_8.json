The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The teacher is in a rural, low-income area and offers free tutoring after school for her own students. She provides snacks herself. Then a parent from another school asks if she can tutor her son, who's in a different county and school. The teacher initially agreed to help if the kid could make it on time, but the parent's son arrives too late after school ends. The teacher offers to tutor him separately but charges $25 per session because she's already spending her time and energy after work. The parent gets angry, calls her names, and accuses her of being selfish and only in it for money.\n\nFirst, the teacher is already providing a service for free. She's not required to tutor beyond her own students, especially when it's outside her school's hours. She's not making money from her current students' tutoring, so charging the new student is understandable. The parent might be upset because they expected the same free service, but the teacher isn't obligated to do so. The teacher is also dealing with her own family responsibilities after work, which is a valid personal boundary. The parent's reaction seems unfair because they're not respecting the teacher's time and the fact that she's already going above and beyond her job. The teacher isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries and seeking compensation for her extra time. The parent's accusations are baseless since the teacher is helping despite personal costs. So, the answer should be B.\n"
