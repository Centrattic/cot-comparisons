The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The teacher is offering free tutoring for their own students because the district doesn't allow charging. They mention that the area is low-income, so they even provide snacks themselves. Then a parent from another school contacts them about tutoring her son, who is in a different county. The teacher initially agrees but finds out the child can't make the scheduled time.\n\nNow, the parent wants the teacher to adjust their schedule to accommodate the child, which would mean the teacher has to stay until 4:15 PM, which is after their own work hours. The teacher is already exhausted by 4:15 and has to help their own son with homework. They decide to charge $25 per session instead of offering it for free, which leads to the parent flipping out and calling them names.\n\nThe question is whether the teacher is in the wrong. Let's consider the factors. The teacher is already providing free tutoring for their own students, which is generous, especially given the economic conditions. They have a set schedule and time constraints. The parent's son attends a different school, so the teacher isn't obligated to help. When the teacher asks for compensation for the additional time, the parent reacts negatively. The parent's anger seems misplaced because the teacher is setting boundaries and offering a reasonable fee for their time. The teacher isn't obligated to work extra hours for free, especially when it impacts their personal time and family responsibilities. The parent's insults imply that the teacher is selfish, but the teacher is managing their own limits and providing a service that isn't free in the market. The key here is that the teacher is not in the wrong for setting boundaries and seeking compensation for their time when helping someone outside their original commitment. So the answer should be B.\n"
