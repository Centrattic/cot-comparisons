The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the TITA (That's In The Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about a first-grade teacher who offers free tutoring to their own students but is approached by a parent from another school asking for tutoring for their son, who attends a different school. The teacher agreed initially but then realized the child couldn't make the scheduled time and offered to tutor separately but at a fee. The parent got angry and called the teacher names.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The teacher is in a low-income area and already offers free tutoring to their own students, which they do without pay and even provide snacks. The parent of a student from another school asks for help, and the teacher is sympathetic. However, the child's school is in another county and ends later, so the teacher would have to stay past their usual time. The teacher offers to do so but at $25 per session, which the parent is upset about, leading to the confrontation.\n\nNow, the main question is whether the teacher is in the wrong. The teacher is in a situation where they are already volunteering their time and resources for their own students. The parent is asking for help for a student not in their class or school, which the teacher isn't obligated to help with. The teacher's offer to tutor separately but at a fee is a reasonable request for compensation, especially since they are not being paid by their district for this and it would impact their personal time and ability to help their own son.\n\nHowever, the parent's reaction is harsh, but that doesn't necessarily make the teacher right or wrong. The teacher's decision to charge might be seen as necessary due to the extra time and effort required. But is the teacher in the wrong for not helping? The key here is whether the teacher had an obligation to the other student. Since the child is from a different school and the teacher's job responsibilities don't extend to other schools, the teacher isn't required to help. The parent's assumption that the teacher should help for free might be the issue here. The teacher's request for payment is a way to balance their personal time and resources, especially in a low-income area where they already provide snacks and time without pay.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the teacher is in a position of authority and offering help to a child in need, even at a fee, is commendable. But the parent's expectation that the teacher should help for free, especially for a student from another school, might be unreasonable. The teacher is not in the wrong for setting boundaries and seeking fair compensation for their time beyond their professional responsibilities.\n\nSo, considering all this, the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong. The teacher is not obligated to tutor another school's student, and charging a reasonable fee for their time is justified, especially when they're already providing free services to their own students.\n"
