The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the teacher in the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that the teacher is offering free after-school tutoring to her own students, but a parent from another school asks her to tutor their child who's in a different county and has different school hours. The teacher offers to do it for $25 per session because she's already exhausted after her own work and can't do it for free. The parent gets angry and calls her names.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the teacher's position. She's already providing free tutoring for her own students, using her own time and money for snacks. She's in a rural, low-income area, so maybe she knows the community and wants to help. But when asked to help a student outside her school and district, she can't do it because of the timing and her own commitments. She then offers to charge for her time, which is the market rate in the area. \n\nThe parent is upset because she expected the teacher to do it for free. But the teacher isn't obligated to help students outside her school. She's already giving her time for free for her own students, and now expecting her to do the same for another school's child without compensation might be unreasonable. The teacher is also a parent herself, dealing with her own son's homework and a long commute. \n\nThe parent's reaction seems over the top. The teacher is asking for payment to cover her time, which is fair since she's not being compensated by her job for this additional work. The key point is whether the teacher was wrong in charging for her time when helping someone outside her usual commitment.\n\nAlso, the teacher made it clear that the tutoring times were based on her current schedule. The parent's son couldn't make the original time, so she had to adjust. The teacher's energy levels and personal time are valid considerations. \n\nI think the teacher isn't in the wrong because she's setting boundaries for her time, especially when it's outside her professional responsibilities. The parent's expectations might be unrealistic, not considering the teacher's workload and personal life. Charging for her time in this context is reasonable, and the parent's hostile reaction is inappropriate. So the answer should be B, the teacher is not in the wrong.\n"
