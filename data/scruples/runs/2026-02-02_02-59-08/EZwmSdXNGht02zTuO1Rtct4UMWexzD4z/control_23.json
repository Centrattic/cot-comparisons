The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The teacher is offering free tutoring after school, which they already do for their own students. They mention that they tutor for free because of conflict of interest policies. Now, a parent from another school asks if they can tutor their child, who is in a different county and can't make the regular schedule. The teacher says they can do it, but only if the kid arrives by 2:50, which the parent realizes is impossible because their school ends later.\n\nSo the parent then asks if the teacher can do a separate session for their child after the teacher's school day ends. The teacher is already tired by 4:15, has to drive home, help their own son with homework, and can't do it for free. They offer $25 per session, but the parent gets upset and accuses them of not caring about kids and being selfish.\n\nThe teacher is asking if they're in the wrong for not tutoring the kid for free. The key points here are the teacher's existing commitments, the policy against paid tutoring for their own students, and the parent's unreasonable expectations. The teacher is already helping their own students for free and has a valid reason for needing compensation when asked to extend their time beyond their current capacity. The parent's reaction seems harsh, especially since the teacher isn't in a position to offer free help beyond their existing schedule. The teacher isn't obligated to provide extra services outside their job, especially when it affects their personal time and family responsibilities. So, the answer is B, the teacher isn't in the wrong.\n"
