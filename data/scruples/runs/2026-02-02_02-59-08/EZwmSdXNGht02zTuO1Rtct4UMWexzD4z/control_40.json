The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. So the teacher is asking if they're in the wrong for not tutoring a student from another school. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the teacher already offers free tutoring after school for their own students. They provide snacks, do it for 45 minutes right after school ends at 2:50 PM. The parent of a student they were tutoring asked if they could tutor their own son, who is in a different county and school. The timing conflict is there because the other school ends later, so the kid can't make the 2:50 PM slot. The parent wants the teacher to adjust their schedule to accommodate.\n\nThe teacher is already working until 2:40 PM, then tutoring until 3:25 PM (assuming a 45-minute session). Then they have to drive home, which takes 40 minutes, meaning they'd get home around 4:05 PM. But the other kid would arrive at 4:15 PM, which would require the teacher to stay much later. The teacher mentions they're out of energy by 4:15 and have to help their own son with homework. So the timing and energy are issues.\n\nThe teacher offers to tutor for $25 per session, which is under the local going rate of $30. The parent gets angry, calls the teacher names, accuses them of not caring about kids and being selfish. The teacher is wondering if they're in the wrong for not helping.\n\nNow, considering the teacher's situation: they're already giving their time for free, with personal sacrifices (paying for snacks, their own time). The request would require significant additional time and energy outside their already committed schedule. The teacher is a human with personal responsibilities. Offering a reasonable rate for their time isn't unreasonable, especially since they can't do it for free due to the timing. \n\nThe parent's reaction seems harsh. The teacher didn't do anything wrong by setting boundaries. They already help their own students for free. The other parent's son isn't their student, and the logistics don't work. The teacher is not obligated to tutor outside their school or adjust their schedule beyond what they've already committed. Charging for their time in this case is fair, especially since they can't do it for free. The parent's accusations are unfair, as the teacher is helping others without charge and is willing to compensate for the extra time. \n\nSo, the teacher isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
