The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The teacher is tutoring students for free after school, providing snacks, and doing it all in a low-income area. Then a parent from another school asks if the teacher can tutor their son, who's in a different county. The teacher agrees to do it only if the kid can make it by 2:50 PM, but the kid's school ends later, so he can't make it on time. The parent then asks if the teacher can wait until the kid arrives at 4:15 PM. The teacher says she's too tired by then and needs to help her own son, so she offers to tutor for $25 per session. The parent gets angry and attacks the teacher.\n\nThe question is whether the teacher is in the wrong. \n\nFirst, the teacher is already providing free tutoring for her own students, which is commendable. She's doing this despite the low pay and the fact that she can't charge her own students. When a parent from another school asks for help, the teacher is in a tough spot. She's not obligated to tutor students outside her school district, especially since they attend a different school. The parent's request is outside the teacher's responsibility. \n\nThe parent then expects the teacher to adjust her schedule without compensation. The teacher is working long hours, driving home, and helping her own child. She's not being greedy by asking for $25\u2014considering the going rate is $30, she's even giving a discount. The parent's reaction is unprofessional and uncalled for. The teacher isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries and seeking compensation for her time, especially when it's outside her job duties. The parent's accusations that the teacher doesn't care about kids are baseless given the teacher's prior actions. \n\nSo, the answer should be B\u2014No, the teacher isn't in the wrong.\n"
