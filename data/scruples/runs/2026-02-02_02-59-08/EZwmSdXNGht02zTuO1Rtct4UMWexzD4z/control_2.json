The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. So, the teacher is asking if they did the wrong thing by not helping a student from another school. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the teacher already offers free tutoring sessions after school for their own students. They provide snacks, which they pay for themselves. Then another parent, from a different school, asks if the teacher can tutor her son. The problem is that the boy is in a different county and his school lets out later, so he can't make the existing tutoring times. The parent wants the teacher to adjust their schedule to accommodate this.\n\nThe teacher offers to tutor but at a cost of $25 per session. The parent gets angry, calls the teacher names, and accuses them of not caring about the kids. The teacher is now wondering if they were wrong for not offering free help.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the teacher is already giving their time and resources for free to their own students. They can't take on more without pay because of their own time constraints and responsibilities. The parent expected the same free service but it's not feasible. The teacher is in a rural, low-income area, so maybe the parent is upset about the cost, but the teacher isn't allowed to charge their own students anyway.\n\nFrom the teacher's perspective, they're not in the wrong because they were already doing a lot for free. They have limits to their time and energy. The parent's son isn't even in their school, so the teacher isn't obligated to help. The parent's reaction seems unfair because they didn't consider the teacher's availability or the fact that the teacher is working for free for others. The teacher is also a parent themselves with their own responsibilities. \n\nHowever, some might argue that the teacher should help a child in need regardless. But the teacher's job already includes providing free tutoring, and they can't take on more without pay. The parent's son isn't eligible for the existing free sessions. The teacher's offer to charge is reasonable, considering the time involved. The parent's anger over payment is misplaced, especially in a low-income area where they might not afford it. But the teacher had to set boundaries.\n\nIn the end, the teacher isn't in the wrong. They made a reasonable offer and the parent's reaction was unfair. So the answer should be B.\n"
