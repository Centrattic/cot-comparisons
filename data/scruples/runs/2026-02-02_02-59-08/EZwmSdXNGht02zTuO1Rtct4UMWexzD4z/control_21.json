The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author here is in the wrong. So the situation is about a first-grade teacher offering free tutoring to their own students because the district has a policy against charging. They provide snacks and tutor after school. Then a parent from another school (so not their student) contacts them, asking if they can tutor their son. The problem is that the child is in a different county and school, and the parent can't get him there on time because the school dismisses later. The teacher offers to tutor him separately but only after school ends, which would be around 4:15 PM. The teacher gets to work at 6:30 AM, so by 4:15 PM, they're already exhausted. Plus, they have to drive home, which takes 40 minutes, and help their own son with homework.\n\nThe teacher sets a rate of $25 per hour, which is slightly below the local going rate of $30. The parent then yells at them, calling them names and implying they don't care about kids and are selfish. The teacher is feeling guilty and wants to know if they're the asshole for not helping the student and charging money.\n\nHmm. First, the teacher is already doing free tutoring for their own students, which they can't charge for due to district policies. That's commendable, especially in a low-income area where the kids might not have access to other help. Now, this parent is asking for tutoring for their son in a different school. The teacher is not obligated to tutor outside their own students, right? Also, the time conflict is real. If the child can't arrive on time, the teacher can't disrupt the existing schedule or push their own sessions back because they start immediately after school. \n\nThe parent's expectation might be that since the teacher tutors other kids for free, they should do the same for their child. But the teacher has their own constraints: energy levels, personal responsibilities, and the need to get home. Charging $25 is reasonable because they can't do it for free and the parent's child isn't their student. The teacher can't afford to lose income or work more hours without compensation. \n\nThe parent's reaction is pretty harsh. They accused the teacher of being selfish and in it for money, which is a bit unfair since the teacher is already giving their time and resources for free in their own school. The teacher isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries and seeking fair compensation for their time beyond what they already do. The parent should have understood the teacher's limitations and the fact that they can't provide services for non-students without some form of payment. \n\nSo I think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong. They're justified in not helping outside their capacity and charging a reasonable rate for their time when possible. The parent overreacted and didn't consider the teacher's personal situation.\n"
