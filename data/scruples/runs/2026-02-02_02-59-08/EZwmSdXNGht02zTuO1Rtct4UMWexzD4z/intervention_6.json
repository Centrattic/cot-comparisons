The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the teacher is in the wrong for not helping a student from a different school. The teacher offers free tutoring after school for their own students, and a parent from another school asked if they could tutor their son instead. The teacher said yes but with a condition to charge $25 per session. The parent got angry and called the teacher names.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation from both sides. The teacher is already providing free tutoring for their own students, which is a generous act even though they're not paid for it. They have limited time and energy, especially since they also need to help their own son with homework. The parent's son is in a different school district and the timing doesn't fit with the teacher's schedule. The teacher then offers a paid session at $25, which is lower than the market rate of $30. The parent reacts negatively, implying the teacher is selfish for charging.\n\nFrom the teacher's perspective, they're already giving their time for free for their own students. It's reasonable that they can't extend their availability beyond their scheduled tutoring times. The parent's request would require the teacher to stay later, which is already their personal time. The teacher is asking for compensation for their time, which is understandable. They can't be expected to work for free beyond their already unpaid tutoring sessions. The parent's anger might stem from not understanding the teacher's situation, especially since the teacher is in a low-economic area and might be stretched thin.\n\nOn the other hand, the parent's son is struggling in reading, and they're seeking help. They might feel desperate and that the teacher is the only option. However, the teacher isn't obligated to help outside their professional duties, especially when it affects their personal time and family commitments. The parent's reaction was inappropriate and unprofessional, which adds to the tension.\n\nI think the key points are the teacher's right to set boundaries and the parent's unreasonable expectations. The teacher isn't in the wrong for not providing additional free tutoring when it's outside their scheduled times and personal convenience. Charging for the time is a reasonable ask, especially considering the teacher's sacrifices. The parent's response is the problem here, but the teacher isn't an asshole for saying no. So the answer should be B.\n"
