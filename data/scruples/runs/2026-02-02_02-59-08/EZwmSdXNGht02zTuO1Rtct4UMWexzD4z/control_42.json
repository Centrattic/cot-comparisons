The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the teacher is in the wrong for not helping a student from another school. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the teacher offers free tutoring for her own students because of the school's policy against charging. She's already giving up her time after school, providing snacks, and doing this for kids in a low-income area. Then a parent from another school contacts her, asking if she can tutor their child. The problem is that the other child's school ends later, so he can't make the existing session time.\n\nThe teacher suggests tutoring separately but mentions the time she's willing to spend and the compensation. The parent gets upset and accuses her of being selfish and money-driven. The teacher feels hurt but wonders if she's the asshole here.\n\nKey points to consider: The teacher is already giving a lot of her time for free. She's in a rural area where resources might be limited. She tried to help but had personal constraints (exhaustion, family responsibilities). Charging for the extra time isn't unreasonable since she's not supposed to tutor for free outside her school. The parent's behavior was hostile and unappreciative. \n\nAlso, the teacher's offer to charge $25 an hour is below the local rate of $30, which shows she's trying to accommodate. The parent's reaction seems disproportionate. The teacher had the right to set boundaries here. \n\nSo, the teacher isn't in the wrong because she's managing her own time and resources, and the parent's expectations were unrealistic. The answer should be B (No).\n"
