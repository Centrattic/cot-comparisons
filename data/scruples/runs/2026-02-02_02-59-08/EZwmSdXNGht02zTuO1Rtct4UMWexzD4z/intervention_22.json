The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The teacher is offering free tutoring after school for students in their own school. They can't charge their own students because it's a conflict of interest. A parent from another school asks if the teacher can tutor her son, who is in a different county and different school. The teacher says they can't do the existing tutoring session because timing doesn't work, but if the parent brings the kid later, they'd charge $25 per session.\n\nThe parent flipped out, calling the teacher names and accusing them of not caring about kids and being selfish. The teacher is now questioning if they're in the wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here: The teacher was already providing free tutoring for their own students. The parent's son is from a different school, so the teacher isn't obligated to help. The teacher offered to tutor but at a cost because the timing would require staying later, which the teacher isn't capable of doing for free. The parent was upset about being charged.\n\nNow, the question is whether the teacher is in the wrong. The parent might argue that since the teacher is a professional educator, they should help regardless of payment, especially in a low-income area. But the teacher has already given a lot of their time for free, and the parent is asking for something outside the teacher's normal duties and location. Also, the teacher can't charge their own students, but in this case, it's a different student, so charging might be permissible. However, the parent's reaction was harsh because they might not be able to afford the $25, given the low-income area mentioned.\n\nOn the other hand, the teacher isn't required to provide free tutoring for any student, especially outside their school. They set boundaries, which is reasonable. The parent's outburst was inappropriate, but the teacher's decision to charge might be seen as reasonable given the extra time and effort. The teacher might not be in the wrong for setting their own terms, even if the parent can't afford it. However, if the parent's son is in real need and the teacher has the resources, there might be an argument that the teacher should help without charge. But the teacher has their own limitations and responsibilities, like helping their own child at home.\n\nSo, considering all that, the teacher isn't necessarily in the wrong. The parent was unreasonable in their reaction, and the teacher had the right to set boundaries. The fact that the parent came from another school adds another layer where the teacher isn't obligated. The teacher's offer to tutor for a fee is a middle ground, but the parent's response was the problem. Therefore, the answer would be B (No).\n"
