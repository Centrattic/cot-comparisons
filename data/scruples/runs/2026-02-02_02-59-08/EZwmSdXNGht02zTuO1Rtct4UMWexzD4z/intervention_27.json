The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a first-grade teacher who offers free tutoring after school to her students. She's in a low-income area, so she provides snacks and does this for free. Then a parent from another school contacts her because her friend's daughter is being tutored, and the parent wants her son to get help too. The teacher agrees but finds out the child is in another county and can't come on time. The parent asks for separate sessions starting later, which would mean the teacher has to stay later. The teacher offers to do it for $25 an hour, which the parent yells at her over, calling her names and accusing her of not caring about kids.\n\nFirst, the teacher is already providing a valuable service for free to her own students, which is commendable. She's going above and beyond by offering snacks and doing this without compensation. Now, when a parent from another school asks for help, the teacher is in a tough spot because the child isn't hers and the logistics are tricky. She's already at capacity with her energy and responsibilities after school. Asking for $25 an hour seems reasonable, given that the going rate is $30, so she's even giving a discount. \n\nThe parent's reaction is pretty harsh and unprofessional. The teacher isn't obligated to help a student from another school, especially when it's not part of her job duties. She's already dedicating personal time and resources to her own students. The parent's accusations are unfair, as the teacher is clearly trying to help but has limits. \n\nHowever, maybe the teacher could have been clearer about her ability to help from the start instead of agreeing initially, then having to back out. But given that the parent approached her while she was already tutoring another child, maybe the teacher didn't realize the logistical issues right away. The key point is that the teacher isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries and asking for compensation for her time outside of her job. The parent's anger is misplaced because the teacher isn't responsible for tutoring students outside her school or district. So the answer is probably B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
