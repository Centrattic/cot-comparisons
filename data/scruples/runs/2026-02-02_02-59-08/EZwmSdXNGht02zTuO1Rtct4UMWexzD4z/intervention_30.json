The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the teacher is in the wrong for not tutoring another student and charging a fee. \n\nFirst, the teacher already offers free tutoring to their own students, which is generous. They mention the constraints: time after school, providing snacks, and personal responsibilities. Then a parent from another school asks if the teacher can tutor her son, who's in a different county. The teacher says yes if the kid can come after school, but the parent's son can't get there on time.\n\nSo the teacher offers to do a separate session for the other kid, but the timing is an issue. The teacher would have to stay until 4:15, which is after a long day. The teacher is also responsible for their own child. They charge $25 a session, which is less than the local rate. The parent gets angry, calls the teacher names, accuses them of not caring about kids and being in it for money.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to consider the situation. The teacher is already giving up their time for free for their students. They can't realistically extend their time beyond their own responsibilities. Charging for a one-on-one session outside the school's policy might be an option, but the teacher is in a low-economic area. However, the parent's reaction is hostile, maybe because she expected free help. \n\nBut the teacher isn't obligated to help outside their school. They made it clear the timing issues and offered a solution with payment. The parent's reaction is unprofessional. The teacher is not in the wrong for setting boundaries. Charging a reasonable fee after offering free help isn't necessarily wrong. The parent's accusations are harsh, but the teacher isn't being selfish; they have their own limits.\n"
