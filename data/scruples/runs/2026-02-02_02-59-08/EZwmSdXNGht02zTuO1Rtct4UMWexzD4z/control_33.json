The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the teacher is in the wrong for not helping the student from another school. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the teacher is already providing free tutoring after school for their own students, which is generous, especially in a low-income area. They even pay for snacks themselves. That shows dedication. Now, a parent from another school asks for help with her son, but he's in a different county and can't make the existing tutoring time. The teacher offers to tutor him separately but asks for $25 per session because they're already exhausted after work and have their own responsibilities. The parent gets upset and accuses the teacher of not caring about kids and being selfish.\n\nThe key points here are the teacher's boundaries and compensation. The teacher isn't obligated to tutor students outside their school, especially when it's a different district. Also, they're not charging their own students, which is a conflict of interest. Charging a different student for individual sessions might be reasonable since it's outside their regular duties and adds extra time. The parent's reaction seems unfair because the teacher is setting limits on their time and energy, which is understandable. The teacher isn't being selfish; they're managing their own capacity and responsibilities. So, the teacher isn't in the wrong for saying no and asking for compensation. The answer should be B.\n"
