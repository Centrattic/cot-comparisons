The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The teacher is asking if they're an asshole for not helping a student from another school. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the teacher offers free tutoring for their own students. They tutor after school, at their own expense for snacks. That's pretty generous. Then a parent from another school contacts them, asking if they can tutor her son. The problem is the timing\u2014he can't make the existing session because of the school's later dismissal and travel time. The teacher suggests tutoring separately but wants $25 per session. The mom gets angry and insults the teacher.\n\nNow, the teacher's main argument is that they can't stay late due to energy levels and their own responsibilities. They also mention the going rate for tutors is $30, so they charged $25 as a discount. But the parent is upset because they expected free help, maybe thinking the teacher should do it out of the goodness of their heart.\n\nIs the teacher in the wrong? Well, the teacher wasn't obligated to tutor in the first place. They were already providing free tutoring for their own students. When asked to extend that to another student from a different school, they're facing logistical challenges and perhaps burnout. Charging a fee is reasonable given the time and effort required, especially since they're not getting paid for this extra work. The parent's reaction is harsh, but the teacher's request for compensation doesn't seem unreasonable. However, maybe the teacher should have set clearer boundaries from the start. Alternatively, maybe they shouldn't charge and offer the same free help, but that's not necessarily their fault here. The key point is whether the teacher had an obligation to help. Since the student isn't theirs and they're already giving their time for free, I don't think the teacher is in the wrong. The answer is B.\n"
