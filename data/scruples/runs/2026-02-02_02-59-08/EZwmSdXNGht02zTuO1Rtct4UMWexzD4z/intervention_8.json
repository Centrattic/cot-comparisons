The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the teacher, the author of the situation, is in the wrong for not helping a student from another school. So I need to analyze the situation from both angles.\n\nFirst, the teacher offers free tutoring to her own students because she's in a low-income area. She's already doing this on her own time, providing snacks, and it's after school. That's a lot of personal sacrifice. Then a parent from another school contacts her, asking for help with her son, who's in a different county and school. The teacher agrees to help if the child can make it on time, but the timing doesn't work. The parent wants separate sessions, which would require the teacher to stay way later, maybe until 4:15, and then drive home, plus help her own son. The teacher asks for $25 per session, which is below the local rate, and the parent gets upset.\n\nSo, the key points here: the teacher is already providing free tutoring to her own students. The parent is asking for a student not in her school, which isn't her responsibility. The teacher can't adjust her schedule because of personal commitments and energy levels. She's not in a position to offer free time beyond what she's already doing. The parent's reaction is harsh and unfair, attacking the teacher's motives.\n\nOn one hand, the teacher might be seen as not helping a child in need, but on the other, she's already stretched thin. She's asking for compensation, which is reasonable given her time. The parent is in a different school district, so it's not the teacher's obligation. The teacher's time is limited, and she can't just extend it indefinitely without considering her own needs.\n\nThe parent's anger is misplaced because the teacher isn't required to help outside her own students. The teacher's offer to charge $25 is a way to set boundaries and cover her time, which is fair. The parent's reaction is unprofessional and hurtful. So, the teacher isn't in the wrong for setting these boundaries. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
