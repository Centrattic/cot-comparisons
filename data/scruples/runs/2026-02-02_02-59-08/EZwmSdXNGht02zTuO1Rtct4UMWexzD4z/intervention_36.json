The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this AITA post is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe teacher offers free tutoring after school for their own students, providing snacks and spending their own time. A parent from another school contacts them, asking if they can tutor her son, who is in a different county and school. The teacher agrees to help if the child can make it on time, but the parent's son arrives late. The teacher then offers to tutor separately but at a cost of $25 per session, which is below the local rate. The parent gets angry, calling the teacher names and accusing them of not caring about kids.\n\nFirst, the teacher is already providing a significant service for free. They're in a rural, low-income area, so charging might be a sensitive issue. The parent's son is in a different school district, so it's not the teacher's responsibility. The teacher is also managing their own family time after work. The parent's reaction seems harsh, but the teacher was trying to accommodate but couldn't do it for free beyond their capacity.\n\nThe key points: The teacher isn't obligated to help another school's student. They offered to help if the child could attend at the scheduled time. When that wasn't possible, the teacher wanted compensation for their time, which is reasonable. The parent's anger might stem from feeling that the teacher isn't altruistic, but the teacher is a professional with limits. The teacher's actions seem justified. The parent made unreasonable demands, and the teacher was within their rights to say no or ask for payment. So, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
