I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not letting her boyfriend borrow her car anymore because he keeps draining the gas without refilling it. \n\nFirst, the boyfriend uses the car for visits to his grandma, which are 3.5 hours away. Each trip uses a full tank, costing $60. He does this three times, and each time he comes back with an empty tank. The author is upset because she pays for the car, maintenance, insurance, and gas, but he doesn't contribute. She's told him multiple times that if this continues, she won't let him borrow the car. He then asks to take it again, and she refuses. He gets angry, calling her names.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, she's the one who owns the car and is covering all the costs. He's using her resources without contributing. When she sets boundaries and follows through on her warning, he's upset. From a fairness perspective, he's not paying for the usage, which is a valid concern. The author is standing up for her own financial interests, which is reasonable. The boyfriend's response seems dismissive and disrespectful. \n\nThe key points here are: ownership responsibilities, agreed-upon boundaries, and the response to broken trust. Since he's not honoring the agreed terms (refilling gas, contributing financially), her decision to revoke the privilege isn't inconsiderate. It's a consequence for his repeated neglect. So, the answer is B\u2014she's not in the wrong.\n"
