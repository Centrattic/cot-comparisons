I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a boyfriend and girlfriend living together for three years. The boyfriend has borrowed the girlfriend's car three times to visit his grandmother, 3.5 hours away, and each time he takes it with a full tank and returns it empty, costing the author around $60 each time. The author has warned him multiple times that if this continues, she'll stop letting him borrow the car. He then tried to take it again, and when she said no, he got upset, calling her names like juvenile and vindictive. The user thinks the author might be in the wrong but wants a second opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the fairness of both parties' actions. The author owns the car and is covering all expenses, including maintenance, insurance, and gas. The boyfriend isn't contributing to the car's costs but is using it, which seems unfair. The boyfriend's argument is that the car isn't his, so he doesn't pay for it. But using the car without contributing to its costs could be seen as taking advantage. The author is within her rights to set boundaries, especially after repeated breaches of trust. The boyfriend's reaction of calling her names and dismissing her concerns is inappropriate. The author's response to stop him from using the car is a reasonable consequence given his actions. The boyfriend's behavior of not refilling the gas and ignoring warnings is disrespectful. The author is protecting her property and finances, which is justified. The boyfriend's disrespect and lack of accountability make him more at fault here. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
