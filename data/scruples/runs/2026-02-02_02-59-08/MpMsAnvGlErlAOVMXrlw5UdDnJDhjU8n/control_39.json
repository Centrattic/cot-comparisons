I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author's boyfriend borrowed her car multiple times, each time taking it with a full tank and returning it empty. Each time this happens, it costs the author $60 for gas. He sold his own car when he went back to university, so he doesn't have another vehicle. The author has a car that she owns, maintains, and insures, and he refuses to contribute anything to these costs because it's not his car.\n\nThe boyfriend has taken the car three times to visit his grandma, 3.5 hours away, and each time he's left without putting gas back. The author is upset because she's paying for both the car and the gas. She's warned him that if this continues, she'll stop letting him borrow the car. When he tried to take it again for a day trip, she said no, and he got angry, calling her names like juvenile and vindictive.\n\nSo the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. \n\nFirst, the boyfriend is using the author's car, which she owns and pays for. She's clear that the car isn't his, so he isn't contributing to the costs. That's a problem. If someone uses a car they don't own, it's reasonable to expect them to cover related expenses like gas, especially if they're driving it for personal trips. The boyfriend is returning the car empty each time, which is costing the author money, and he's not making up for it. \n\nThe author has given multiple warnings, which he ignores. Then she decides to cut off his access to the car as a consequence. The boyfriend reacts poorly, accusing her of being unfair and holding grudges. \n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, the author is within her rights to set boundaries. She's allowing him to use her car, but he's not following the agreed-upon terms. By not replenishing the gas, he's being financially irresponsible. The author is trying to protect her own resources, which is reasonable. \n\nThe boyfriend's behavior is inconsiderate. He's using her car for his convenience without contributing, which is a classic example of taking without giving back. His reaction of anger and name-calling suggests he's not respecting her boundaries, which is a red flag in a relationship. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for making a decision to stop letting him borrow the car after repeated violations of the agreed terms. She's being responsible, while the boyfriend is being inconsiderate and disrespectful. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
