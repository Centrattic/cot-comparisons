I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not letting her boyfriend borrow her car anymore. The boyfriend has a history of borrowing the car, using all the gas, and not refilling it or contributing to the costs. The car is hers, and he's not paying for maintenance or insurance. The key points here are about fairness, responsibility, and boundaries.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend is using the car multiple times, which is his responsibility to maintain but he's not contributing. Each time he takes it, he uses up the gas and doesn't refill it, costing the author money. The author has warned him multiple times, and he's ignored those warnings. Now she's decided to cut off the borrowing, which he's upset about, calling her names like juvenile and vindictive.\n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, the boyfriend is benefiting from the car without contributing. It's understandable that the author wants to set boundaries to protect her own expenses. She's responsible for the car, so it's reasonable that she expects him to help with costs, especially when he's using it. The boyfriend's response about old grudges is a classic deflection tactic. The author's actions are about establishing respect for her property and financial contributions. \n\nThe boyfriend's behavior shows a lack of consideration for her financial burden. By not refilling the gas or offering to pay, he's essentially making her subsidize his trips. The author's decision to stop lending the car is a logical consequence after repeated warnings. The boyfriend's anger and accusations suggest he doesn't see his actions as problematic, which is part of the issue. \n\nIn relationships, both parties should contribute to shared expenses, especially when one is using resources owned by the other. The author isn't wrong for enforcing boundaries after being disrespected. The boyfriend's refusal to take responsibility is the root of the conflict here. So, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
