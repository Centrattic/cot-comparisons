I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The scenario is about a boyfriend not paying for gas when borrowing his partner's car. \n\nFirst, the boyfriend borrowed the car multiple times, each trip taking 3.5 hours. He fills it up before leaving but returns it empty, costing $60 each time. The partner is upset because she's paying for the car's maintenance, insurance, and now the gas. She told him several times that if he keeps doing this, she'll stop letting him borrow the car. When he asks again, she says no, and he gets angry, calling her names. The question is whether she's in the wrong.\n\nHmm. Well, the boyfriend isn't contributing to the car's costs at all. He uses it but doesn't help with gas, even though she's already paying for maintenance and insurance. Gas is a direct cost of using the car, so it's reasonable for her to expect him to cover that. He promised to return it full but never does. She gave multiple warnings, and he still continued, leading her to revoke his access. His reaction seems to be about his feelings being hurt rather than the actual issue of responsibility. \n\nSo, from a fairness standpoint, she's standing up for her financial rights. He's not respecting her boundaries. Even if they're in a relationship, sharing expenses should be mutual. If the car is hers and he's using it, it's reasonable for her to expect gas costs. He's being irresponsible by not paying, and she's taking action after repeated instances. The boyfriend's anger seems misplaced, as he knew the consequences. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
