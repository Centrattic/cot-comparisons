I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about a boyfriend who borrows the author's car to visit his grandma, but doesn't refill the gas each time, leading to arguments. The author decided to stop letting him borrow the car, which upset him.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The boyfriend uses the car multiple times, each time taking it with a full tank and returning it empty. That's three times, costing $60 each time. The author is paying for maintenance, insurance, and gas, but the boyfriend won't contribute because it's not his car. The boyfriend brushes off the issue, says sorry but forgets, and never fills up the tank. The author warned him multiple times, then finally said no more borrowing the car. The boyfriend reacted angrily, calling her names.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nLooking at the situation, the boyfriend is using a car that the author is responsible for financially. He's not contributing to the costs, despite using it multiple times. The author has set boundaries and tried to communicate, but the boyfriend isn't respecting them. The boyfriend's actions are leading to repeated financial strain on the author without reciprocation. The author's decision to stop allowing the car use seems like a reasonable response after repeated issues. The boyfriend's reaction is dismissive and disrespectful, which adds to the problem.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the boyfriend is using the car without contributing to the costs. Ethically, if someone is using another person's property that they're paying for, they should cover the expenses. The author is within her rights to set conditions for borrowing the car, such as returning it with a full tank. Since he's not meeting those conditions, her decision to stop is justified. The boyfriend's anger and accusations of being vindictive might indicate that he's not taking responsibility for his actions.\n\nPossible counterarguments: Maybe the boyfriend didn't realize the cost, or the author should have discussed it more. However, the author mentions multiple warnings, so she's made her expectations clear. The boyfriend's refusal to comply after being warned multiple times is the main issue here. The author is protecting her own financial interests and the car's maintenance, which is reasonable.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
