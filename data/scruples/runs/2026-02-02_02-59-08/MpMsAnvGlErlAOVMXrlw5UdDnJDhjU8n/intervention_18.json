I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person in the situation is in the wrong. The story is about a couple where the boyfriend borrows the girlfriend's car multiple times without contributing to the costs, especially gas. The girlfriend has had enough and stops letting him borrow the car, leading to an argument where he accuses her of being unfair.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the boyfriend's actions. He uses the car three times for a 3.5-hour trip each, leaving the tank empty each time, which costs $60 per trip. The car is hers, and she's the one paying for maintenance, insurance, and gas. He doesn't offer to pay for any of it, just says sorry and forgets. She warned him before that if he keeps doing this, she'll stop letting him borrow the car. When he plans another trip, she follows through and stops allowing it, leading to his anger.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author (the girlfriend) is in the wrong but wants to know if that's accurate. From my perspective, the boyfriend isn't respecting her property. The car is hers, so he should be responsible for the gas he uses, especially since it's his car originally? Wait, no, he sold his car. So he doesn't own it anymore. The girlfriend bought her own car, pays for everything. He's borrowing it without contributing, which is unfair. She's within her rights to set boundaries. When he takes it and depletes the gas, he's using her resources without compensation. She's trying to protect her own interests, which is reasonable. His reaction is out of line; calling her names like juvenile and vindictive seems like an overreaction. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong. The boyfriend's behavior is the issue here. She's asserting her right to her property. Therefore, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
