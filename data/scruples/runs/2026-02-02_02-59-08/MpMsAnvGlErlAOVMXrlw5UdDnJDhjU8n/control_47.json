I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation involves a boyfriend who's been borrowing the author's car to visit his grandma and other places, but he never pays for the gas and doesn't refill the tank. The author has warned him multiple times, and when he ignores the warnings, she decides to stop letting him borrow the car. He gets angry and accuses her of being vindictive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The car is the author's, she pays for maintenance and insurance. The boyfriend uses it without contributing, which is a financial burden. He's been given chances to correct his behavior but hasn't. The author is trying to protect her own resources, which is reasonable.\n\nNow, looking at the boyfriend's actions: borrowing the car without contributing to costs, not refilling the gas despite being asked. This shows a lack of consideration. The author's response is to stop allowing him to use the car, which is within her rights since it's her property. His reaction seems unfair and dismissive of her concerns.\n\nThe question is about whether the author is wrong. From a fairness perspective, when someone uses another's property without contributing, especially repeatedly despite warnings, the owner is justified in revoking access. The boyfriend's anger and accusations seem unjustified here. So, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer should be B.\n"
