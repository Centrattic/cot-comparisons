I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a boyfriend who borrows the author's car to visit his grandmother, but each time he returns it with an empty tank and doesn't pay for the gas. The author has warned him multiple times, and now when he asks to borrow the car again, the author refuses, leading to an argument.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points. The car is the author's, she's responsible for maintenance, insurance, and gas. The boyfriend is using it without contributing financially. He's been told repeatedly not to do this, but he keeps forgetting to refill the gas. The author is trying to enforce boundaries by cutting off access to the car. The boyfriend reacts negatively, calling her names.\n\nNow, considering fairness. The author is within her rights to set boundaries regarding her property. The boyfriend's behavior is inconsiderate and financially burdensome since each trip costs $60. The fact that the car can make the trip on a full tank means he should refill it to avoid the cost. His repeated negligence and refusal to contribute is problematic. The author's response is a reasonable attempt to protect her resources. The boyfriend's reaction seems to dismiss her valid concerns. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? If she's the one who owns the car and is bearing all the costs, and he's not contributing, then she's not in the wrong. She's trying to enforce her rules, which is her right. The boyfriend is the one not respecting her property and financial boundaries. So the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
