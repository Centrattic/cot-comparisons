I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person (AITA) who wrote the situation is in the wrong. Let me break down the scenario.\n\nSo, the boyfriend and girlfriend live together and have been in a three-year relationship. The boyfriend sold his car when he went back to university two years ago. The girlfriend owns a small car that she's paying for maintenance and insurance. The boyfriend refuses to contribute to these costs because it's not his car. \n\nThe issue is that his grandmother lives 3.5 hours away. He's borrowed the car a few times to visit her, each time taking it with a full tank and returning it empty. Each time, this costs her $60 for gas. He apologizes for forgetting to refill the tank, but it keeps happening. She's warned him multiple times that if this continues, she'll stop letting him borrow the car. \n\nNow, he wants to take the car again for a weekend trip, but she refuses because of his past behavior. He gets upset, calling her juvenile and holding grudges.\n\nThe user initially thinks the author (AITA) is in the wrong but wants to know what others think. The question is whether the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B).\n\nFirst, let's look at the boyfriend's actions. He's borrowing a car that he doesn't own or pay for, using it for long trips, and not replenishing the gas. Even if he apologizes each time, the behavior is repeated. The cost adds up, and he's not contributing to the car's expenses. That seems unfair. The girlfriend has a right to expect that if someone borrows her car, they maintain it, including gas, especially for trips that deplete the tank.\n\nShe's given warnings and set boundaries, which he's ignored. When she finally enforces the rule, he accuses her of being vindictive. That seems like he's not respecting her boundaries. \n\nIs she in the wrong? Well, she's trying to enforce her rules after repeated issues. The boyfriend isn't respecting her car and the associated costs. She's not just being petty; she's trying to protect her own resources. Her response\u2014stopping the car usage after he breaks the rules\u2014is a reasonable consequence. \n\nHe might argue that he's entitled to use the car since they live together, but he doesn't contribute to its upkeep. That's a valid point. However, she's clearly stated her terms, and he hasn't met them. So, in this context, she's not the one in the wrong. The boyfriend's behavior is the issue here. He's using her resources without contributing and then being upset when boundaries are set. \n\nSo the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
