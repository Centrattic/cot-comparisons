I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a boyfriend and girlfriend who live together. The boyfriend borrows the girlfriend's car to visit his grandmother, but each time he returns it with an empty tank, costing the author $60 each time. He refuses to pay for maintenance, insurance, or the gas, even though he uses the car. The author has warned him multiple times, but he keeps doing it. Finally, she stops allowing him to borrow the car, and he gets angry, accusing her of being vindictive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The boyfriend is using the author's car without contributing to the expenses. Gas is a recurring cost, and he's not covering it despite being asked. The author has given warnings, and the boyfriend hasn't complied. When she takes away the privilege, he reacts negatively.\n\nLegally, if the car is in the author's name, she's responsible for all associated costs. The boyfriend isn't a co-owner, so expecting him to pay for maintenance, insurance, or gas isn't unreasonable. However, if they're in a committed relationship living together, there might be an expectation of shared responsibilities, but that's more about social norms than legal obligations.\n\nThe author's actions\u2014stopping him from using the car after repeated warnings\u2014seem reasonable as a response to his non-compliance. The boyfriend's reaction, calling her names and accusing her of holding grudges, is a problem. He's not taking responsibility for his actions, which is a key factor here.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the boyfriend is using her car without contributing, and she's set boundaries, then she's acting within her rights. The boyfriend's behavior is the issue. So the author isn't in the wrong; the boyfriend is. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
