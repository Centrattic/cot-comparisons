I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a boyfriend who keeps borrowing his partner's car to visit his grandma, not refueling it, and the partner is now cutting off access because of it.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend uses the car three times for 3.5-hour trips, each time taking it with a full tank and returning it empty. The cost per tank is $60, so that's $180 total. The author owns the car, pays for maintenance, insurance, and now the gas. The boyfriend refuses to pay anything, saying it's not his car. The author warned him multiple times, but he keeps forgetting or not offering to pay. Then when the author finally says no, he gets upset and accuses her of being vindictive.\n\nSo, the key points here: ownership of the car, financial responsibility, and communication. The author is the car's owner and is covering all costs. The boyfriend is using it without contributing, which the author finds unfair. The author tried to address the issue multiple times, but the boyfriend didn't take it seriously. When she finally stops allowing him, he's angry and blames her.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, the boyfriend isn't contributing to the costs of using the car. Even if it's not his car, it's a shared expense since they live together. The author might have a valid point in expecting some contribution, especially for the gas which he uses entirely. The boyfriend's behavior of not refueling after using it adds to the cost, which the author has to cover. \n\nThe author's response of cutting off access after multiple warnings seems reasonable. The boyfriend's reaction is hostile and dismissive, which might be more about his own frustration than the reasoning. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Probably not. She's standing up for her financial interests and setting boundaries after repeated issues. The boyfriend's arguments seem invalid given his actions.\n"
