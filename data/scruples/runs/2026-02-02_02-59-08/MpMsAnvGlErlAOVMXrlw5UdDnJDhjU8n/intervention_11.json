I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the boyfriend is borrowing the car to visit his grandma, but each time he takes it with a full tank and returns it empty, costing the author money. The author has warned him multiple times, but he keeps doing it. Now the author has stopped letting him borrow the car, and the boyfriend is upset, calling her names. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know what I think.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation from both sides. The author owns the car, pays for insurance, maintenance, and gas. The boyfriend uses the car without contributing financially. He's been doing this multiple times, despite warnings. The author's action is to stop him from borrowing the car, which he sees as a loss of privilege. He's upset and accuses her of being vindictive.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, the boyfriend is using a car he doesn't own and isn't contributing to its costs. The author is within her rights to set boundaries. She's made it clear that she's not okay with the current arrangement. The boyfriend's response seems to be dismissive and disrespectful, not taking her concerns seriously. The author's decision to stop lending the car is a reasonable consequence after repeated instances of the boyfriend not following through.\n\nThe key points here are consent, financial responsibility, and respect for agreed-upon terms. Since the car is the author's, she has the right to decide who uses it and under what conditions. The boyfriend's behavior is neglecting his responsibility to maintain the car's gas level, which is a basic courtesy if he's borrowing it. The author isn't in the wrong for enforcing her boundaries. The boyfriend's reaction suggests he doesn't value her feelings or the financial impact on her, which is problematic. So, the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
