I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not letting her boyfriend borrow her car anymore because he keeps draining the gas without refilling it and not contributing to costs. \n\nFirst, the background: They live together, boyfriend sold his car when going back to university. The author has her own car, pays for maintenance, insurance, and gas. The boyfriend borrows the car, uses up the gas, and doesn't refill it. Each trip to his grandma's is 3.5 hours away, and he takes a full tank, comes back empty. Each tank costs $60. This has happened three times. The author is upset about the cost and the lack of responsibility. She's told him multiple times that if this continues, she won't let him borrow the car again. Then, when he asks to take it again, she denies him, and he gets angry, calling her names. She's asking if she's in the wrong (AITA).\n\nSo, the question is whether her reaction is justified. Let's break it down. The boyfriend is using a car that's not his, which he doesn't pay for. He's using it for long trips that cost money, and he's not replacing the gas. Even though he apologizes each time, he doesn't follow through. The author is setting boundaries because she's covering all the costs. When he asks again, she revokes the privilege, and he's upset.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, the boyfriend isn't contributing to the expenses of the car he's using. It's reasonable for the author to expect that if he borrows the car, he either refills the gas or contributes to the costs. The fact that he keeps doing it and then the author takes away the privilege is a logical consequence. The boyfriend's reaction (calling her juvenile, vindictive) might be because he doesn't see the issue as a big deal, but from the author's side, the financial burden is real. She's paying for something he uses without contributing. \n\nIs she in the wrong? No, because she's setting a boundary after repeated infractions. He's not respecting her financial responsibilities. The boyfriend's behavior is the issue here. He's using her resources without contributing, and she's finally taking action. So the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
