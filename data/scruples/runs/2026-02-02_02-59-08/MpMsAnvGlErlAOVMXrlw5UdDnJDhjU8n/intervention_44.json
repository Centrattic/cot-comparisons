I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong. So, the situation is that the boyfriend uses the author's car to visit his grandma 3.5 hours away, but each time he takes it with a full tank and returns it empty. The author is upset because she's paying for gas and maintenance, and he refuses to contribute. After three times, the author decides to stop letting him borrow the car, leading to a conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the responsibilities here. The car is the author's, so she's the one paying for everything. The boyfriend is using it without contributing. Even if the car is shared in some way, the author is clearly the owner. The boyfriend's refusal to pay for gas or maintenance seems like a problem. The author gave warnings, so she tried to address it before cutting off access. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction\u2014calling her juvenile and vindictive\u2014might indicate he doesn't see the issue. But from the author's perspective, she's being fair by holding him accountable. The key points are ownership of the car and the boyfriend's refusal to contribute. The author is within her rights to set boundaries, especially since he's not respecting her property. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), the author is not in the wrong. She's the owner of the car and has the right to decide how it's used. The boyfriend is using her resources without contributing, and she's setting a boundary after repeated issues. The boyfriend's behavior is inconsiderate, and the author isn't being unreasonable by stopping the car use.\n"
