I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post (the author) is in the wrong. The situation is about their boyfriend borrowing her car without contributing to the maintenance or gas, and then getting upset when she stops allowing him to borrow it after repeated issues.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author and her boyfriend live together, have been in a three-year relationship. He sold his car to go to university. She owns a small car, which she's paying for maintenance and insurance. He refuses to pay anything because it's not his car. His grandma lives 3.5 hours away, and he's visited her a few times, each time borrowing the car. The car can make the trip on a full tank, which costs $60. Each time he takes it, he leaves it empty. She's upset because she's paying for gas and maintenance alone. He says he's sorry but forgets and never fills it up. She warned him multiple times that if he continues, she won't let him borrow the car again. When he asked again, she said no, and he got angry, calling her names like juvenile and vindictive.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. \n\nFrom the author's perspective, she's clearly stating that she's responsible for all the costs of the car. Her boyfriend isn't contributing, and even though she owns the car, he's using it without helping with the expenses. The repeated instances of him not refilling the gas are a problem. She's given warnings and followed through with stopping the car loan. His reaction seems to be the issue here\u2014accusing her of being in the wrong when he hasn't contributed.\n\nFrom his side, maybe he feels that he's entitled to use the car since they live together? But he sold his own car, so maybe he's relying on her car. However, he's not contributing financially. It's possible he sees the car as a shared resource, but the cost is all on her. \n\nLegally, if the car is hers, he's not obligated to pay for it unless there's an agreement. Since he's not contributing, he's not in the right. She's trying to enforce boundaries after multiple warnings. His anger over her stopping the car use might be because he feels it's unfair, but he hasn't met his side of the responsibility. \n\nThe issue here is about fairness and responsibility. The author is maintaining the car and allowing him to use it, but he's not helping with the costs. His behavior of not refilling the gas is a consistent problem. She's given him chances and then took action when he didn't comply. His reaction is dismissive and blaming her, which might show that he's not taking responsibility. \n\nSo, given that, the author is not in the wrong. She's standing up for her own rights and financial responsibilities. The boyfriend is the one not fulfilling his part by not contributing to the costs and ignoring her warnings. Therefore, the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
