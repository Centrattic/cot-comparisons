I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a boyfriend using the author's car without contributing to the costs. The boyfriend borrows the car multiple times, each time taking it with a full tank and returning it empty, costing the author $60 each time. This has happened three times, and the author has warned him before. Now, when he wants to take the car again, the author refuses, leading to an argument where he accuses her of being vindictive.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author's actions are justified. The key points are the financial responsibility and respect. The car is the author's, so she's paying for maintenance, insurance, and gas. The boyfriend isn't contributing despite using it. Even though he's her partner, she's not obligated to cover his costs for using her property. He's been warned multiple times, and he hasn't changed his behavior. When she finally stops allowing him to use the car, he reacts negatively, calling her names. That reaction is problematic because he's the one who's been irresponsible.\n\nThe boyfriend's argument that it's not his car might be technically true, but in a relationship, mutual respect and consideration are important. If he's using her car, contributing to the expenses would be reasonable. His refusal to do so and the repeated negligence about the gas tank shows a lack of respect for her resources. The author's decision to revoke his permission is a logical consequence after repeated warnings. His losing his mind and blaming her for being vindictive is unconstructive and unfair. \n\nIs there any nuance I'm missing? Maybe the boyfriend's intentions are good, but his actions are inconsiderate. The author is standing up for her own boundaries, which is valid. Relationships require compromise, but that doesn't mean one partner should bear all the costs without contribution. The boyfriend's behavior is disrespectful to the author's financial and personal boundaries. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for setting those boundaries and enforcing them.\n"
