I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (a girl in a three-year relationship) is in the wrong for not letting her boyfriend use her car anymore. The boyfriend borrowed her car three times to visit his grandma, each time leaving it with an empty tank. Each time, she was upset but he just apologized and forgot again. Now he wants to use the car again, and she said no. He got angry, calling her names. The question is whether she's at fault.\n\nFirst, the financial aspect: the guy isn't contributing to the car's maintenance or insurance, which he claims isn't his. But he's using it, which logically means he should help with costs. He's not paying for gas each time, even though he benefits. That's a point against him.\n\nSecond, the repeated behavior: he's taken the car three times, each time draining the gas without refilling. She warned him, but he didn't change. Then he wants to use it again. Her cutting him off seems like a reasonable response after multiple warnings. He's not taking responsibility, which is her problem.\n\nThird, the reaction: when she said no, he blew up, calling her names. That's a red flag. His outburst suggests he's not respecting her boundaries. Her stance is about fairness and her own expenses. She's protecting her own resources. \n\nIn relationships, communication and mutual respect are key. The boyfriend isn't respecting her financial boundaries and isn't taking her concerns seriously. She's trying to set a boundary after repeated issues. The boyfriend's behavior is the problem here, not hers. So the answer should be B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
