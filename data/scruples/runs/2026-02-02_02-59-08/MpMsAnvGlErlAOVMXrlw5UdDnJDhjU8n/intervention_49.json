I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in the situation described. The boyfriend uses the author's car to visit his grandma, which is 3.5 hours away. Each time, he takes it with a full tank and returns it empty, costing the author $60 each time. The author has warned him multiple times, and he keeps doing it, not offering to pay. Finally, the author refuses to let him borrow the car anymore, leading to an argument where the boyfriend accuses her of being vindictive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the fairness of the situation. The car is the author's, she pays for maintenance, insurance, and gas. The boyfriend uses it without contributing, which seems unfair. Even though they live together, sharing expenses is a common practice in relationships. The boyfriend isn't paying his share, which the author has a right to expect if he's using the car. \n\nThe boyfriend's behavior\u2014repeatedly not refilling the gas and dismissing her concerns\u2014shows a lack of consideration. The author has given clear warnings, so when he ignores them, she decides to stop lending the car. That seems like a reasonable response to protect her own resources. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction is also problematic. Accusing her of being juvenile and holding grudges when he's the one who's been irresponsible. The author isn't holding a grudge; she's setting boundaries after multiple instances of him not respecting her property. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. She's standing up for her own financial responsibilities and setting boundaries. The boyfriend's actions and response are the issues here. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
