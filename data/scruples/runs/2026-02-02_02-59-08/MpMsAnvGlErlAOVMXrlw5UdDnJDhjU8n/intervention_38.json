I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a couple where the boyfriend is borrowing the author's car to visit his grandmother, but he never fills the gas back up, costing the author money each time. The author has warned him multiple times and finally decided to stop letting him borrow the car, which led to an argument where the boyfriend accuses her of being juvenile and holding grudges.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The boyfriend uses the car for a 3.5-hour trip, each time taking a full tank and returning empty. Each trip costs $60, and this has happened three times. The author is paying for the maintenance, insurance, and gas, while the boyfriend refuses to contribute because it's not his car. The author has clearly communicated her concerns and set boundaries, but the boyfriend hasn't changed his behavior. Now, he wants to take the car again, and the author denies it, leading to his anger.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides. The boyfriend is using a car that's not his, which is a shared resource in their relationship. Even though he's not paying for the car, he's using it for his personal errands and not covering the associated costs. The author has been upfront about her rules and given warnings, so her decision to revoke the privilege isn't unreasonable. On the other hand, the boyfriend might feel that visiting his grandmother is important and that the author is being too strict, but he hasn't addressed her concerns about the financial burden.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction of calling her juvenile and holding grudges seems dismissive and not acknowledging her valid concerns. The author is trying to set boundaries for her own financial well-being, which is reasonable. The boyfriend's refusal to contribute or compensate for the gas he uses is a recurring issue, and the author is justified in enforcing the rules she's set. So, the boyfriend's behavior is the main issue here. The author is not in the wrong for standing up for her boundaries, especially after multiple warnings. Therefore, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
