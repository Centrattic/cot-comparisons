I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a couple living together for three years. The boyfriend uses the girlfriend's car to visit his grandmother, which is 3.5 hours away. Each time he takes the car, he borrows it with a full tank and returns it empty, costing the girlfriend $60 each time. He's done this three times, and she's been upset each time, but he just apologizes and forgets next time. Now, when he asks to borrow the car again, she refuses, and he gets angry, calling her names.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants to know my take. Let me break it down. First, the girlfriend owns the car and is paying for maintenance and insurance. The boyfriend isn't contributing, even though he uses it. He's not just using it for the grandma visits, but other things too, and never replaces the gas. She's given multiple warnings, and now she's cut off access. He reacts poorly.\n\nSo, is she in the wrong? Let me consider both sides. From her perspective, she's paying for the car and the gas, and he's repeatedly not respecting her by not refilling the tank. She's set boundaries, and when he continues to break them, she's taking action. He's not taking responsibility for his part. From his side, maybe he feels that he's entitled to use the car since they live together, or that she's overreacting. But he's the one not following through on the agreed-upon responsibility (refilling gas). Also, he's not contributing to the car's costs, which might be a point. \n\nBut the main issue is the repeated failure to refill the gas despite warnings. She's been clear about the consequences, and he's continued. Her response is to stop allowing him to use the car. That seems reasonable. His reaction is to accuse her of being juvenile, which is dismissive. \n\nSo, in terms of responsibilities, he's not fulfilling his part. She's owning up to the car but setting boundaries. It seems like he's at fault here. Therefore, the author (girlfriend) is not in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
