I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is a boyfriend and girlfriend who live together. The boyfriend uses the girlfriend's car to visit his grandma, three and a half hours away. Each time, he takes it with a full tank and returns it empty, costing $60 each trip. The girlfriend is upset because he doesn't pay for gas or maintenance, and she's stopped him from borrowing the car. He got angry, calling her names like juvenile and vindictive.\n\nSo, the author's position is that the girlfriend is in the wrong, but they want to know if that's right. The options are A (author in the wrong) or B (author not in the wrong). The user is asking for a yes or no answer based on the situation.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The boyfriend uses the car multiple times, each time draining the gas without reimbursement. The girlfriend has warned him multiple times, and he ignores her. She then decides to stop allowing him to use the car. He reacts negatively, leading to conflict.\n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, the boyfriend is using a car he doesn't own, doesn't pay for, and is not contributing to expenses. The girlfriend is the one maintaining the car, paying for insurance and gas. It's reasonable for her to expect some responsibility from him, especially since he's using her resources. The boyfriend's refusal to contribute financially or acknowledge the cost seems inconsiderate. The girlfriend's decision to stop allowing him to use the car is a response to his repeated inconsiderate actions. \n\nThe boyfriend's anger in this case is disproportionate if he's been warned multiple times. The girlfriend isn't being vindictive; she's setting a boundary after he's ignored her requests. The boyfriend's behavior is the main issue here. Therefore, the author's initial thought that the girlfriend is in the wrong might not hold up. The correct answer is likely B (author not in the wrong), meaning the girlfriend is not at fault.\n"
