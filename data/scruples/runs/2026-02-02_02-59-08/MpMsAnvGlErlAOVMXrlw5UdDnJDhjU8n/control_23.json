I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a couple where the boyfriend keeps borrowing the author's car to visit his grandma and not refilling the gas. The author is upset because she's paying for everything and the boyfriend isn't contributing. She's told him multiple times to stop, but he keeps doing it, and then when she denies him access to the car, he gets angry. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The car is hers, she's paying for maintenance, insurance, and gas. The boyfriend uses the car, which is not his, for trips. Each time he takes it, he uses up the gas and doesn't refill it, costing her money. She's warned him multiple times, and he hasn't changed his behavior. Then she decides to stop letting him borrow the car, which leads to his anger.\n\nSo, from a fairness perspective, the boyfriend isn't contributing to the costs of the car he uses. The author is within her rights to set boundaries with her property. The boyfriend's actions are inconsiderate and not respecting her financial contributions. The author's response is to restrict access, which is her choice as the car is hers. The boyfriend's reaction seems to be blaming her for standing up for her own interests. \n\nI should consider if there's any nuance I'm missing. Maybe the boyfriend has a valid reason for not contributing, but the situation states that he refuses to pay because it's not his car. That seems like a selfish stance. The author's position is about fairness and respecting her property. The boyfriend's anger seems misplaced because he's been warned and hasn't complied. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author isn't in the wrong. She's trying to enforce rules she's set, and the boyfriend isn't respecting that. The boyfriend is at fault here for not contributing and losing his privilege. So the answer should be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
