I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. So the question is whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a couple who live together. The boyfriend borrowed the girlfriend's car multiple times to visit his grandmother, but each time he takes it with a full tank and returns it empty, costing the girlfriend $60 each time. The girlfriend has told him several times that if he doesn't stop, she won't let him borrow the car again. Now he wants to take it again, and she refuses, leading to an argument where he accuses her of being vindictive.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the key points. The car is the girlfriend's, which she owns and pays for. The boyfriend is using it without contributing to the costs. The girlfriend has given him multiple warnings, and he hasn't changed his behavior. She then revokes his privilege, which he reacts negatively to.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, if someone is using a resource that you own and you're responsible for the costs, it's reasonable to expect that the user contributes. The boyfriend isn't paying for gas, maintenance, or insurance, even though he's using the car. The girlfriend is within her rights to set boundaries, especially since he's not respecting the previous warnings. The boyfriend taking the car with a full tank and returning it empty three times suggests a pattern of negligence. Her decision to stop lending the car is a reasonable response to his repeated disregard for her rules and the financial burden.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction seems to be more about being upset at losing the privilege rather than acknowledging his responsibility. Calling her juvenile and vindictive is a deflection. The girlfriend isn't holding grudges; she's enforcing a rule she's already clearly stated. The boyfriend's behavior is the issue here.\n\nI think the girlfriend is justified in her actions. The boyfriend's failure to take responsibility for the gas and the repeated violations of the agreed-upon usage make her response reasonable. So the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
