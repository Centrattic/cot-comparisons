I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. The main issue is about the boyfriend using the girl's car to visit his grandma, not refilling the gas, and her deciding to stop letting him borrow the car. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The boyfriend uses her car three times for 3.5-hour trips, each time taking it with a full tank and returning it empty. The cost is $60 each time, and he doesn't pay for it. The girl has warned him multiple times, but he keeps forgetting and doesn't offer to refill the gas. Now he wants to take the car again, and she refuses, leading to an argument where he accuses her of being vindictive.\n\nSo, who's in the wrong? The girl's car, her responsibility to maintain and pay for. The boyfriend uses her car but doesn't contribute to the costs. Even though he's borrowing it, he's not compensating her for the expenses. She's given warnings, and he's ignored them. When she takes away the privilege, he's upset and calls her names.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, the boyfriend isn't being responsible. He's using a resource (the car) that his partner owns and pays for, without contributing. The girl has the right to set boundaries, especially since he's not respecting her wishes. His reaction seems unreasonable given that he was warned multiple times. She's not being vindictive; she's upholding her decision after repeated failures to comply.\n\nI think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The boyfriend is at fault here because he's not respecting her property and financial contributions. Her response is justified after he continues to ignore previous warnings.\n"
