I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not letting her boyfriend visit his grandma because he keeps draining her car's gas without refilling it. \n\nFirst, the situation: They live together, the boyfriend sold his car when he went back to university two years ago. The author has her own car, which she pays for maintenance, insurance, and gas. The boyfriend borrows the car, uses it to visit his grandma 3.5 hours away, takes it with a full tank and returns it empty. Each trip costs $60 in gas, and he's done this three times. She's asked him multiple times to stop or at least compensate her, but he brushes it off. Now he wants to take the car again for a day trip, and she refuses, leading to his anger.\n\nSo, the key points here. The boyfriend is using a car that isn't his, which the author is solely responsible for financially. He's using it in a way that incurs direct costs (gas) and hasn't contributed anything. The author has given multiple warnings, but he hasn't changed his behavior. She then removes the privilege of using the car, which he reacts negatively to, calling her names.\n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, she's right to be upset. If he's using her resources, especially when they live together, he should contribute. Gas is a cost, and if he's using the car, it's reasonable for him to cover that. His refusal to pay or even acknowledge the issue is a problem. She's setting a boundary, which is reasonable. \n\nHe's using the car for his personal visits, which she's okay with initially but now can't handle because of the financial strain. She's given him chances to correct his behavior, but he didn't. So her decision to revoke the privilege is a response to his lack of responsibility. \n\nHis reaction seems disproportionate. He's using the car for his family, which is understandable, but he's not respecting her financial contributions. Her actions are about standing up for her own boundaries, which is valid. \n\nTherefore, the author is not in the wrong. She's justified in her actions given his repeated neglect of her requests and the financial impact. The answer should be B.\n"
