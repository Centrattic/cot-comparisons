I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for not letting her boyfriend visit his grandma. The situation is that the boyfriend has borrowed her car multiple times, each time taking it with a full tank and returning it empty, costing her $60 each time. He's not paying for gas or maintenance, and after she warned him, he got angry when she stopped allowing him to borrow the car.\n\nFirst, I need to consider ownership and responsibility. The car is hers, and she's the one paying for all the expenses. He's not contributing, even though they live together. That seems like a point in her favor. She's clearly communicated her boundaries, but he keeps using the car without compensation. When she finally stops allowing it, he accuses her of being vindictive. \n\nNow, from a fairness standpoint, if someone uses your resources and doesn't contribute, that's a problem. The boyfriend isn't respecting her property by not maintaining the gas or paying his share. She's within her rights to set limits. The boyfriend's reaction is more about his needs versus her rights. \n\nBut wait, maybe there's a nuance. Is there any expectation that they should share expenses since they live together? But the car isn't his, so unless there was an agreement to share, she's not obligated. He should have either offered to pay for gas or used alternative transportation. His frustration might stem from feeling that his needs are being ignored, but that doesn't justify him not paying for the gas. \n\nAlso, the fact that he has been warned multiple times and still didn't comply shows a pattern of disregard. She's following through on her boundary, which is reasonable. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. The boyfriend's actions are the issue.\n"
