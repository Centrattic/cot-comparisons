I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is about a boyfriend who borrows his girlfriend's car to visit his grandmother, but he never refills the gas and she's refusing to let him borrow it anymore. She's the one who's paying for the car, insurance, and maintenance, and he's not contributing.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The boyfriend has borrowed the car three times for a 3.5-hour trip each, taking it full and returning it empty. Each time costs the author $60 in gas. He's been told multiple times to refill the tank but hasn't. The author warned him that if this continues, she'll stop letting him borrow the car. When he tried to take it again, she said no, and he got angry, calling her names like juvenile and vindictive.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides. The author is standing up for her financial responsibilities. She's paying for everything related to the car, and the boyfriend isn't contributing. It's fair for her to expect that if he uses the car, he covers the gas costs. He's been warned multiple times, so he's aware of the issue, yet he continues the behavior. That's a pattern of disrespect towards her efforts. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction, on the other hand, is to accuse her of being vindictive. He might feel that the car is his responsibility, but since he sold his own car, maybe he doesn't have a choice. However, using someone else's car without contributing to the costs seems unfair. The argument here is about fairness and mutual respect in a shared living situation.\n\nI think the author is in the right. She's setting boundaries for her property and financial contributions. The boyfriend isn't respecting her boundaries, and his behavior is inconsiderate. The author's response is a reasonable consequence given his repeated actions. So the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
