I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the scenario is in the wrong. So the situation is that they live with their boyfriend, who has been borrowing their car to visit his grandma, which is 3.5 hours away. Each time he takes the car, he leaves it with a full tank and returns it empty. The cost of gas for a full tank is $60 each time, and this has happened three times. The boyfriend refuses to contribute to the car's maintenance and insurance, which the user is paying for. They've warned him multiple times, and now he wants to take the car again over the weekend, but the user refuses. He gets upset, calling her names like juvenile and vindictive.\n\nFirst, I need to assess who is in the wrong here. The boyfriend is using someone else's car and not contributing to the costs. Even though the car isn't his, he's benefiting from it and causing expenses. The user is clearly the owner and is covering all the costs, including the gas he uses. The boyfriend isn't offering to pay for the gas, which is a fair point. The user has given warnings and is now cutting off permission because he hasn't changed his behavior. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction is also important. He's accusing her of holding grudges instead of addressing his repeated failure to follow through on promises. His behavior seems inconsiderate and disrespectful. The user is within their rights to set boundaries, especially since the boyfriend isn't respecting the terms of borrowing the car. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the user isn't wrong for protecting their own property and finances. The boyfriend is the one not meeting the agreed-upon expectations. Even if the user is being strict, the boyfriend's actions are the root of the problem. He's not taking accountability and is instead blaming her. \n\nSo, the answer would likely be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because she's enforcing her boundaries after repeated issues, and the boyfriend isn't contributing as he should. The user is justified in their stance.\n"
