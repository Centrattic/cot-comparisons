I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for not letting her boyfriend visit his grandma because he keeps draining her car's gas without filling it up again. \n\nFirst, the background: They live together, have been for three years. The boyfriend sold his car when he went to university. The author has her own car, which she's responsible for all the payments, insurance, and maintenance. The boyfriend refuses to pay for anything because it's not his car. He's been borrowing the car to visit his grandma, who's 3.5 hours away. Each time, he takes it with a full tank and comes back empty. A full tank costs $60. This has happened three times. The author is upset because she feels it's unfair to pay for his visits. He says sorry but forgets next time and doesn't offer to fill up the tank. She's warned him multiple times that if this continues, she won't let him borrow the car anymore. Then he tried to take it again for a day trip, she said no, and he got angry, calling her juvenile and vindictive.\n\nSo the core issue is ownership and responsibility. The car is hers, so he's using it without contributing to the costs. Even though they live together, the car is her personal property. If someone uses another person's property without contributing to the associated costs, that's not fair. The boyfriend isn't taking responsibility for the gas, which is a recurring expense. The author has given warnings, which he's ignored. Then she takes away the access, which leads to his outburst.\n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong. Let's consider both sides. The boyfriend argues that the car isn't his, so he's not responsible. But he's using it, which incurs costs. If two people are sharing a car, even if it's owned by one, the user should contribute to the expenses. However, in this case, he refuses to pay anything because it's not his car. That seems like a problem. The author is just trying to maintain fairness, and she's the one paying all the costs. The boyfriend is using the car for personal trips, which is understandable, but without compensating for the usage. \n\nWhen she revokes the privilege after repeated warnings, that seems reasonable. He's not respecting her boundaries by continuing to use the car without filling up the tank. His reaction of calling her names is also problematic. She's trying to set a boundary, and he's being disrespectful. \n\nSo, from a fairness standpoint, she's not in the wrong. The boyfriend is the one using the car and not covering the costs, and she's enforcing her decision. The anger from him is misplaced because he's the one who's being inconsiderate. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
