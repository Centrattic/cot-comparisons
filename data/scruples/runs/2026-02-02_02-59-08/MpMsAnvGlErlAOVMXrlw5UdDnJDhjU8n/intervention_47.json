I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the boyfriend is borrowing the author's car to visit his grandma, but he's not refilling the gas each time, which costs the author money each time. The author has given warnings and now refuses to let him borrow the car anymore. The boyfriend got angry and accused her of being vindictive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ownership of the car. The car is the author's, so she's the one responsible for maintenance and insurance. The boyfriend isn't contributing to the costs, which might be a point of contention. The fact that he borrowed the car multiple times without refilling the gas, despite being reminded, shows a pattern of not respecting her expenses. \n\nThe author's response was to revoke his borrowing privileges after multiple warnings. She's trying to enforce boundaries. The boyfriend's reaction was anger and calling her names, which suggests he didn't take her concerns seriously. His behavior of forgetting to refill the gas each time and not offering to pay indicates a lack of consideration for her financial burden.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, if someone is using your property repeatedly without contributing to the costs, it's reasonable to set boundaries. The author isn't wrong for wanting to stop the misuse of her resources. The boyfriend's disrespect for her rules and his emotional reaction might indicate that he's in the wrong for not respecting her decisions and not taking responsibility.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong because she's maintaining her rights as the car owner and addressing a legitimate issue. The boyfriend's actions and response are more problematic here. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
