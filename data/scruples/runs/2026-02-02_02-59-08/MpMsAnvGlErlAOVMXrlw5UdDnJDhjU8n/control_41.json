I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author not letting her boyfriend visit his grandma because he keeps using her car without replacing the gas. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. They live together, he sold his car when he went to university. She has her own car, which she maintains and insures. He borrows it, uses all the gas each time, and doesn't refill or pay for it. She's tried multiple times to warn him, but he keeps doing it. Now, she won't let him borrow the car anymore, and he got upset, calling her names like juvenile and vindictive.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let me break it down.\n\nThe boyfriend is using her car, which he isn't responsible for maintaining. Using the gas is a cost he's not paying for. Even though he's sorry next time, he doesn't follow through. She's given warnings, so she's tried to communicate the issue. Her response was to take away the car, which he sees as unfair.\n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, if someone uses another person's resources without contributing to the cost, that's a problem. The fact that he's a partner doesn't mean he can take advantage. She's within her rights to set boundaries, especially since he's not respecting her property and expenses. The boyfriend's reaction of being upset and calling her names seems to be his issue, not hers. She's protecting her own financial interests and property.\n\nBut maybe there's another angle. Could they have found a different solution together? Like him paying for gas or splitting costs? However, he's refused to contribute even after multiple warnings. She's given him chances, and he didn't change his behavior. So her decision to stop lending the car is a logical step.\n\nHe might feel that visiting family is important, but she's justified in her stance because of the financial burden. It's about mutual respect and responsibility. If he wanted to visit his grandma, maybe he should find another way, like taking public transport or using his own car again. But since he sold his, maybe that's not feasible. However, the problem is that he's not respecting her terms for borrowing the car.\n\nIn relationships, both partners should respect each other's property and financial boundaries. The author isn't being unreasonable here. The boyfriend's behavior is the issue, not hers. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
