I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a couple who live together. The boyfriend keeps borrowing the girlfriend's car to visit his grandma, 3.5 hours away. Each time, he takes it with a full tank and returns it empty, costing her $60 each time. He never pays for the gas or maintenance. The girlfriend has warned him multiple times, but he doesn't change his behavior. Now, when he asks to borrow the car again, she refuses, and he accuses her of being vindictive.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants confirmation. I need to decide if the answer is A or B. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend is using her car but not contributing to the costs. Even though he doesn't own the car, using it incurs expenses. It's reasonable for her to expect some financial responsibility, especially since they live together. The boyfriend's actions are causing financial strain on her. She's made her position clear, but he ignores it. His response is dismissive, which seems disrespectful.\n\nThe key points: \n- He uses her car without contributing to costs.\n- She's warned him, but he doesn't change.\n- Her refusal is a consequence of his actions.\n- His reaction is defensive and accuses her of being vindictive.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, she's within her rights to set boundaries. He's not respecting her financial limits. The boyfriend's behavior is the main issue here. The author, the girlfriend, is standing up for herself after repeated infractions. So, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
