I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The situation is about a couple where the girlfriend isn't allowing her boyfriend to visit his grandma because he keeps draining the gas from her car without refilling it. The boyfriend has a history of borrowing the car, using all the gas, and not paying for it. The author (the girlfriend) has warned him multiple times, and now she's withholding the car. The boyfriend is upset, calling her juvenile.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks she is, but I need to evaluate.\n\nFirst, ownership matters. The car is hers, and he refuses to contribute to maintenance or insurance. That's a key point. She's paying for everything. Then, he's using her gas, which costs $60 each time. She's had three instances where he took the car and left it empty. She's given warnings, but he keeps doing it. She finally says no to borrowing the car again. He reacts negatively, saying she's being vindictive.\n\nNow, considering fairness. If he's using her car, shouldn't he contribute to the costs? Even if it's not his car, using it incurs expenses. He's not paying for gas, insurance, maintenance. That's a problem. She's within her rights to set boundaries. She's tried to communicate, given warnings, and now enforcing a rule. His reaction seems to be dismissing her valid concerns as petty.\n\nThe boyfriend's argument is weak because he's the one not following through on his responsibilities. She's not being vindictive; she's protecting her own resources. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. The boyfriend's behavior is disrespectful and inconsiderate. Therefore, the answer should be B (not in the wrong).\n"
