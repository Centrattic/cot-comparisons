I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for not letting her boyfriend visit his grandma because he keeps borrowing her car and not refilling the gas. The boyfriend has taken the car multiple times, each time using up the gas and not paying for it. The author has warned him several times, but he hasn't changed his behavior. Now, when he plans another trip, she refuses to let him use the car, and he gets angry, calling her names.\n\nFirst, the car is the author's, so she owns it. The boyfriend isn't contributing to maintenance or insurance, which she's paying for. Every time he uses the car, he drains the gas and doesn't refill it, costing her $60 each time. She's given multiple warnings, but he keeps doing it. She then revokes his permission, leading to his outburst.\n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, using someone's car without contributing to the costs (gas, maintenance) isn't right, especially if it's a recurring issue. The author is within her rights to set boundaries with her property. The boyfriend's reaction seems to be dismissing her concerns, which is valid because she's the owner. The fact that the car is for a day trip to his grandma is a separate issue, but the author's stance is about the ongoing misuse of her resources. \n\nThe boyfriend's arguments that he \"forgot\" the gas each time don't hold up, especially since he's been warned multiple times. The author's response is reasonable: if he can't respect the terms of borrowing the car, she's justified in revoking his access. His anger over this decision suggests he's not taking responsibility for his actions, which is a red flag in a relationship.\n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong for setting this boundary. The boyfriend is the one not respecting her property and financial contributions, so the answer should be B (No).\n"
