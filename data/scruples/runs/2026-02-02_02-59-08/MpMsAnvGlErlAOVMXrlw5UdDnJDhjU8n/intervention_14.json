I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the boyfriend is borrowing the car to visit his grandma, but each time he takes it, he leaves it with an empty tank, costing the author money. The author has warned him multiple times, but he doesn't pay for the gas or maintain the tank level. Now he wants to take the car again, and the author refused, leading to an argument where the boyfriend accuses her of being vindictive.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points. The car is the author's, and she's responsible for maintenance, insurance, and gas. The boyfriend isn't contributing financially because it's not his car. However, he's using her car frequently, which is a shared expense in a relationship, especially since they live together. \n\nThe boyfriend's actions of taking the car and draining the gas tank without reimbursement or refilling could be considered inconsiderate. The author has communicated her concerns and given warnings, which he's ignored. His response to her refusal seems to be dismissive and accusatory, which might indicate he's not taking her feelings seriously.\n\nIn relationships, especially when sharing resources, mutual respect and contribution are important. The boyfriend's refusal to pay for gas or refill the tank is a financial burden on the author. By not addressing her concerns, he's not respecting her boundaries. The author's decision to stop letting him borrow the car is a logical consequence after repeated warnings. His anger and accusations might show he feels entitled to the car without considering the cost, which is unfair.\n\nBut maybe the author could have approached it differently. For example, setting a clear system where he either pays for the gas or refills the tank each time. However, after multiple instances and warnings, her decision to revoke the privilege seems justified. The boyfriend's reaction being hostile suggests he's not willing to compromise, which is problematic.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong because she's standing up for her own financial interests and boundaries. The boyfriend's behavior is inconsiderate, and her response is a reasonable self-advocacy. Therefore, the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
