I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong. The situation is about a boyfriend borrowing her car to visit his grandma, but not refilling the gas each time. The author is upset because she's paying for the car's maintenance and insurance, and he's not contributing. After multiple instances, she decided to stop letting him borrow the car, and he got angry.\n\nFirst, I need to consider ownership and responsibility. The car is hers, so she has the right to set the terms for its use. He's using her resources (gas, insurance) without contributing financially. Borrowing a car usually comes with the expectation that you maintain it, like keeping the gas tank full. He's not doing that despite being asked. The author gave warnings, so this wasn't an abrupt decision. \n\nHe's also going to university, which might mean he has less income, but that doesn't excuse not refilling the gas. The cost each time is $60, and he's done it three times, which adds up. His response to her decision was angry and dismissive, calling her names, which shows a lack of respect. \n\nThe key points are: ownership, responsibility for maintenance, prior warnings, and his reaction. Since the car is hers and he's not fulfilling his part, the author is justified in revoking the permission. His reaction is inappropriate. So, the answer is B (author not in the wrong).\n"
