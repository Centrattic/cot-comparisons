I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong. The scenario involves a boyfriend who is using the author's car to visit his grandmother, not refilling the gas, and not contributing to the costs. The author has decided to stop letting him borrow the car, leading to an argument.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the fairness of the author's actions. The boyfriend is using a car that he doesn't own, doesn't pay for, and after multiple instances of not returning it full, the author is cutting off access. It seems like the boyfriend isn't respecting the author's property and expenses. The cost of gas adds up, and the author has warned him multiple times without success.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction is also important. He accuses the author of being juvenile and vindictive, which might indicate he's not taking responsibility. The author's decision to stop lending the car could be seen as reasonable to protect their own resources, especially since the boyfriend isn't contributing to the costs. \n\nHowever, one might argue that the author could have handled it differently, like setting clearer terms upfront or splitting the gas costs. But given that the boyfriend didn't honor previous warnings, the author's action might be justified. The key points are consent and respect for property. Since the boyfriend is using the car without sharing costs and despite warnings, the author isn't in the wrong here. So the answer should be B.\n"
