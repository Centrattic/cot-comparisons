I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about the author not letting their boyfriend visit his grandma because he keeps borrowing the car and not refilling the gas. \n\nFirst, the boyfriend borrowed the car three times to visit his grandma, each time using up a full tank of gas. The car is the author's, and they pay for maintenance and insurance. The boyfriend refuses to contribute because it's not his car. The author has warned him multiple times, but he still doesn't refill the tank. Now, the author is revoking the privilege because of this ongoing issue, and the boyfriend got angry, calling her names like juvenile and vindictive.\n\nI need to determine if the author is wrong. Let's break it down. The key points here are ownership, responsibility, and communication. The car is the author's, so she has the right to set boundaries. The boyfriend is using her car without contributing to the costs, which is unfair. Even though he's using it for family visits, which are important, he has a responsibility to either compensate or maintain the conditions set by the owner. \n\nThe boyfriend's behavior shows a lack of respect for her property and her concerns. He keeps borrowing the car but doesn't follow through on the agreement to return it with a full tank. The author gave warnings, which he ignored. Revoking the privilege is a reasonable step. The boyfriend's reaction of getting angry and blaming her for being vindictive is unconstructive. \n\nIn relationships, mutual respect and consideration are important. The author is standing up for her rights regarding her property, which is valid. The boyfriend's actions are dismissive and not taking her feelings into account. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
