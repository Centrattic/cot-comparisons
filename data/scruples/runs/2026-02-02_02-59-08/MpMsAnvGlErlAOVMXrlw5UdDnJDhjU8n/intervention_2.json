I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation is about a boyfriend using the author's car without refueling it after borrowing it multiple times, leading to the author deciding not to let him borrow it anymore. The boyfriend is upset, saying the author is being vindictive.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the facts. The couple lives together. The boyfriend sold his car when he went to university two years ago. The author has her own car, which she pays for maintenance, insurance, and gas. The boyfriend uses her car to visit his grandmother, which is a 3.5-hour trip. Each time, he takes it with a full tank and returns it empty, costing $60 each time. He's done this three times. The author is upset about the gas costs and has warned him multiple times. Now he wants to take it again, and she refuses. He accuses her of being vindictive.\n\nThe author's main issue is that the boyfriend isn't contributing to the expenses since he uses her car. The boyfriend's argument is that it's not his car, so he shouldn't pay. But he's using it, so there's an expectation of shared responsibility? Or maybe not, depending on their agreement.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for not allowing him to borrow the car anymore. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, she's paying for all the car's costs. If someone borrows your car and uses it extensively, it's reasonable for them to contribute to the expenses. The boyfriend isn't just borrowing it occasionally but making long trips that drain the gas. She's paying for the gas each time and has asked him to stop, but he hasn't complied. So she's taking away the privilege as a consequence. Her actions seem justified because he's not respecting her financial boundaries.\n\nOn the boyfriend's side, he might feel that he's only using the car for family visits and that he's sorry each time. He might believe that since it's not his car, he doesn't need to pay for gas. However, the repeated behavior without any effort to compensate or even offer to refill the gas tank suggests a lack of consideration. His reaction of being upset and calling her names might indicate immaturity in handling the situation.\n\nLegally, if the car is solely hers, he doesn't owe her money unless there was an agreement. But in a relationship, especially cohabiting, there's an expectation of mutual consideration. Since he's using her car frequently, contributing to the costs is reasonable. Her decision to stop letting him borrow the car is a logical step after multiple warnings. Therefore, she's not in the wrong for setting boundaries.\n"
