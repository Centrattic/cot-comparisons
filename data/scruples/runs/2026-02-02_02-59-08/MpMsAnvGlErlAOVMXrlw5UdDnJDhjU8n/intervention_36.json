I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a boyfriend who uses the author's car to visit his grandmother and other places, but never refuels it after borrowing it. The author is upset because they're paying for gas and maintenance, and the boyfriend refuses to contribute. The author finally says no more, leading to an argument where the boyfriend accuses her of being unfair.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The boyfriend uses the car multiple times, each time taking it with a full tank and returning it empty. The cost is $60 per tank, and this has happened three times. The author has warned him multiple times, but he hasn't changed his behavior. The author then decides to stop lending the car, which leads to the boyfriend's anger and accusations.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but is seeking validation. My job is to evaluate based on fairness and mutual respect in relationships.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, if someone is using your property (in this case, a car) and not contributing to the costs, that's a valid issue. The boyfriend is taking the car for personal visits and not covering the expenses, which the author rightly finds unfair. The author has given warnings, which the boyfriend ignored. When the author decides to stop the behavior by not allowing the car to be borrowed anymore, it's a reasonable step to protect her own interests.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction of calling her juvenile and vindictive seems like a deflection. He's not taking responsibility for his actions, which is a red flag. The author isn't being unreasonable here; she's setting boundaries after repeated issues. The boyfriend's behavior (using the car without contributing) is the problem, not the author's response.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. She's trying to maintain fairness in the relationship. The boyfriend is the one not respecting her property and financial contributions. Therefore, the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
