I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a boyfriend who's borrowing the author's car to visit his grandmother, but not refilling the gas each time. The author is upset because she's paying for the car, maintenance, insurance, and gas, and the boyfriend isn't contributing. The boyfriend is frustrated when the author stops allowing him to borrow the car.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the fairness of the situation. The author is covering all costs for the car, which is her property. The boyfriend is using it without contributing, which could be seen as unfair. The boyfriend not refilling the gas despite promises or warnings is a repeated issue. The author's response is to stop allowing him to use the car, which seems a reasonable consequence for his continued behavior.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction\u2014calling her juvenile and vindictive\u2014suggests he doesn't see the issue as his fault. But from the author's perspective, she's standing up for her own property and financial responsibilities. The boyfriend's refusal to pay for gas he's using is a point against him. \n\nI should check if the author gave him warnings before taking action. She did mention multiple warnings, so she tried to address it before cutting off access. The boyfriend's continued behavior after those warnings makes the author's decision more justified. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author is not in the wrong. Her actions are a response to his repeated negligence and lack of responsibility regarding her car. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
