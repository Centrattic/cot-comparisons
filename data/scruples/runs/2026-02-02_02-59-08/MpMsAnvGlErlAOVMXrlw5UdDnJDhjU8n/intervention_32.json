I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a couple where the boyfriend is borrowing the girlfriend's car to visit his grandmother, but not refilling the gas each time. The girlfriend is upset about the cost and the fact that he isn't contributing to the car's expenses. When she stops allowing him to borrow the car, he gets angry and accuses her of being juvenile.\n\nSo, the user thinks the author (the girlfriend) is in the wrong, but wants my opinion. The options are A (yes, she's wrong) or B (no, she's not wrong). \n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation from both sides. The girlfriend has a car that she pays for entirely\u2014maintenance, insurance, gas. The boyfriend is borrowing the car multiple times, using up gas each time, which costs $60 per tank. He's not refilling it, even though she's warned him multiple times. She finally decides to stop letting him borrow the car, and he reacts negatively, calling her names.\n\nThe boyfriend isn't contributing to the car's costs, which seems unfair. The girlfriend is within her rights to set boundaries, especially since she's the one covering all expenses. The boyfriend's reaction is hostile and dismissive, which might indicate he's not respecting her feelings or the financial impact. \n\nThe key points here are: ownership of the car, financial responsibility, and communication. Since the car is hers and he's not paying for any part of it, it's reasonable for her to expect that he either refills the gas or compensates her. His failure to do so, despite being warned, is a breach of trust and responsibility. \n\nWhen she decides to stop lending the car, she's asserting her right to protect her property and finances. The boyfriend's anger and accusations seem to be about him feeling that his needs are being dismissed, but he hasn't addressed the underlying issue of contributing to the costs. \n\nIn relationships, sharing expenses is a common point of conflict. The boyfriend's behavior suggests he isn't taking accountability, which is a problem. The girlfriend's response is a logical consequence after repeated issues. \n\nTherefore, the boyfriend's actions are more in the wrong here. The girlfriend is justified in her decision to stop lending the car, as she's been clear about her expectations and he hasn't complied. The answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
