I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not letting her boyfriend visit his grandma because he keeps using her car without paying for gas.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend is living with her and using her car multiple times. Each time, he takes it with a full tank and returns it empty, costing $60 each time. She's had to pay for this three times. He hasn't contributed to the car's expenses, including insurance and maintenance, which she's covering. She's warned him multiple times, but he keeps doing it, apologizing but not changing his behavior.\n\nWhen she finally says no to letting him use the car again, he gets angry and accuses her of being juvenile. The key points here are about fairness and responsibility. The boyfriend isn't contributing financially to the car he's using, which is a shared expense. She's covering all costs, and he's not even refueling the tank after using it. That's a significant financial burden on her side. \n\nThe boyfriend's argument that the car isn't his and thus he doesn't have to pay seems dismissive. Even if it's her car, sharing a car in a relationship often involves mutual respect and consideration. The author is within her rights to set boundaries, especially since he's not respecting her warnings. His reaction of anger and name-calling suggests he's not acknowledging her perspective. \n\nSo, the author's decision to stop allowing him to use the car is a reasonable response to his repeated irresponsibility. She's protecting her own financial interests and setting clear limits. The boyfriend's behavior is the issue here, not the author's reaction. Therefore, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
