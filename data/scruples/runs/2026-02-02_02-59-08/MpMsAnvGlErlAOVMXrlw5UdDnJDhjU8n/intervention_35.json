I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author (the person in the situation) is in the wrong. The scenario is about a boyfriend who uses the author's car to visit his grandmother without refilling the gas or contributing to the costs, and the author has now decided to stop letting him borrow the car. The boyfriend is upset and accusing the author of being vindictive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rights and responsibilities here. The car is the author's, and they are the ones paying for maintenance, insurance, and gas. The boyfriend isn't contributing financially, even though he uses the car multiple times. Each time, he takes it with a full tank and returns it empty, costing the author money each time. The author has warned him multiple times, but he keeps doing it, and now the author is revoking the privilege. The boyfriend is reacting angrily, calling the author names.\n\nSo, from a fairness standpoint, the author is the owner of the car. If someone else is using your property repeatedly without contributing to the costs, it's reasonable to expect them to either pay their share or stop using it. The boyfriend isn't willing to pay, so the author is within their rights to stop lending the car. The boyfriend's behavior is inconsiderate and disrespectful, especially since he's been warned multiple times. The author isn't being vindictive; they're setting a boundary after repeated issues.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the boyfriend feels that visiting his grandmother is important, and he might not have alternatives. But the problem is that he's not respecting the financial responsibilities that come with using someone else's car. The author is the one covering all the costs, which isn't fair. The boyfriend's reaction seems to be about his own disappointment rather than acknowledging the author's standpoint.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. They're protecting their own resources and setting a boundary after being disrespected. The boyfriend's behavior is the issue here, not the author's decision to stop allowing car use.\n"
