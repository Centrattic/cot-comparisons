I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is about a boyfriend who borrows his partner's car to visit his grandmother, but doesn't refill the gas each time. The partner is upset because she's paying for all the maintenance, insurance, and gas, and he's not contributing. After multiple warnings, she decides to stop letting him borrow the car, which leads to a conflict where he accuses her of being vindictive.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the responsibilities here. The boyfriend and girlfriend live together, and she owns the car. He uses it but doesn't pay for anything related to it. The key points are: he borrows the car, uses gas, doesn't refill it, and she's covering all costs. She's clearly communicated her boundaries and the consequences, which he hasn't respected. Now, he's upset when she follows through on her warning.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, if someone is using a shared resource (like a car) that another person owns and maintains, contributing to the costs is reasonable. The boyfriend isn't paying for gas or maintenance, which is a point of contention. The author is trying to enforce her boundaries, which she's already warned about. The boyfriend's reaction seems to be dismissing her valid concerns and instead accusing her of being unfair.\n\nThe user initially thought the author was in the wrong but is now seeking a second opinion. The main question is whether the author overstepped by not allowing him to borrow the car after repeated issues. Given that he's not respecting her terms and she's made it clear that this behavior would lead to consequences, her decision to stop letting him borrow the car seems justified. The boyfriend's anger and accusations might indicate he's not considering her perspective, which could be a red flag for a pattern of disrespecting boundaries.\n\nIn relationships, communication and mutual respect are key. The author tried multiple times to address the issue, and when he didn't comply, she took action. The boyfriend's response is defensive and dismissive, which could suggest he's not taking her feelings seriously. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong; she's standing up for her own needs and boundaries, which is healthy in a relationship.\n"
