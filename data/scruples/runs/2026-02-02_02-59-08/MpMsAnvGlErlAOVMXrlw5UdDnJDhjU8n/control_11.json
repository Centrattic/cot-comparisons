I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author's boyfriend is borrowing her car to visit his grandma, which is 3.5 hours away. Each time he takes the car, he uses a full tank of gas and returns it empty. The tank costs $60, and he's done this three times. The author is upset because she's paying for the maintenance, insurance, and now the gas. She's told him multiple times that if he keeps doing this, she'll stop letting him borrow the car. When he tried to take it again, she said no, and he got angry, calling her names like juvenile and vindictive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ownership of the car. The car is the author's, so she owns it. The boyfriend is using her car without contributing to any costs. That seems unfair. Even if he's her partner, when someone uses another person's property, they should be responsible for the wear and tear, and in this case, the gas. Gas is a direct cost here, and he's using up her resources without contributing. The fact that he keeps forgetting to refill the tank despite multiple warnings is a problem. She's given him clear boundaries, and he's not respecting them. \n\nThe boyfriend's argument is that the car isn't his, so he doesn't pay for it. But that's his choice, and he's still using her car. If he wants to use her car, it's reasonable for her to expect him to cover the gas. The cost of gas for three trips would be $180 (3 times $60), which is a significant amount. If the car isn't his, he can't expect her to cover all the expenses. \n\nThen there's the issue of communication. The author has warned him multiple times, and when she finally enforces the boundary, he reacts negatively. His response is to accuse her of being vindictive and holding grudges, which is dismissive of her valid concerns. His behavior seems disrespectful because he's not taking her feelings into account and is instead lashing out.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the boyfriend's intention is to visit his grandma, which is a family matter. But that doesn't excuse not covering the gas costs. It's about fairness and responsibility. She's the one who owns the car and is bearing the financial burden, so she's within her rights to set boundaries. \n\nI don't see any indication that the author is being unreasonable. She's given him multiple chances, and he's failed to comply. Her decision to revoke the privilege is a logical consequence of his repeated actions. The boyfriend's anger is misplaced because he's the one who's not respecting her rules and the costs involved.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. The boyfriend should have covered the gas costs or found another way to visit his grandma without using her car. The author is protecting her own property and finances, which is entirely reasonable. The boyfriend's reaction shows a lack of respect for her decisions and feelings.\n"
