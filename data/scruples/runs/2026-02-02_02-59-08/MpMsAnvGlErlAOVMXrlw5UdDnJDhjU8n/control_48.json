I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong for not letting her boyfriend visit his grandma after he repeatedly didn't refill the gas in her car. \n\nFirst, the boyfriend uses her car multiple times, each time taking it with a full tank and returning it empty. The cost of gas is $60 each time, and he's done this three times. He's been warned multiple times, but he doesn't fix the behavior. The author then decides to stop letting him use the car, leading to an argument where he accuses her of being juvenile.\n\nNow, I need to determine if the author is wrong. Let's look at the key points. The boyfriend is using her car, which he doesn't own, and isn't contributing to the maintenance or insurance. He's been told repeatedly not to take the gas without replacing it, but he doesn't. The author is trying to protect her financial interests. \n\nThe boyfriend's actions are causing a financial burden on the author without compensation. Even though they live together, he's not paying for the car's expenses. The author set a boundary after multiple warnings, which is a reasonable step. The boyfriend's reaction is defensive and dismissive, not taking accountability. \n\nIn relationships, it's expected that both parties respect each other's property and finances. The author isn't being vindictive; she's enforcing a rule after repeated violations. The boyfriend's behavior is inconsiderate. So, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
