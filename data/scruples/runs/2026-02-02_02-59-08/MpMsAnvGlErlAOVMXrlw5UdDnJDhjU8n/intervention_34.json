I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this situation. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, let's break down the facts. The couple has been together for three years and lives together. The boyfriend sold his car when he went back to university two years ago. The writer owns a car that they're paying for, including maintenance and insurance. The boyfriend borrows the car, uses it for visits to his grandma, which are 3.5 hours away. Each time, he takes it with a full tank and returns it empty, costing the writer $60 each time. This has happened three times. The writer has warned him multiple times that if this continues, they won't let him borrow the car anymore. When he asks to take it again, she refuses, and he reacts angrily, accusing her of being juvenile and holding grudges.\n\nNow, considering the writer's actions. She owns the car and is covering all expenses. The boyfriend isn't contributing to the costs and isn't respecting her rules by not refilling the gas. She has given warnings, which he ignores. His behavior is clearly disrespectful, as he uses the car without contributing and doesn't follow through on his apologies. Her response is to stop allowing him to borrow the car, which is within her rights since it's her property. His anger seems unfounded because he's the one who's repeatedly violated her terms. \n\nThe key points here are ownership responsibility and respect for boundaries. The boyfriend isn't shouldering any financial responsibility, which is a problem. The writer is within her rights to set boundaries regarding the use of her car. His reaction of anger and blame-shifting indicates he's not taking her concerns seriously. Therefore, the writer isn't in the wrong; the boyfriend's actions are the issue here.\n"
