I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe boyfriend and the author have been together for three years and live together. He sold his car when he went back to university two years ago. She has a small car that she just paid off but still covers maintenance and insurance. He refuses to pay anything towards the car because it's not his. His grandma lives 3.5 hours away, and he's visited her a few times. Each time he takes her car, he takes it with a full tank and brings it back empty. A full tank costs $60, and this has happened three times. She's been upset about it because she thinks it's unfair that she's paying for the car and gas for him to use it. He says sorry each time but doesn't change his behavior. She's warned him that if it continues, she won't let him borrow the car anymore. Now he wants to take it for another weekend trip, and when she denies him, he gets angry, calling her juvenile and vindictive.\n\nSo the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A for yes and B for no. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. The car is hers, and she's the one paying for maintenance, insurance, and gas. He's using her car without contributing financially. Even though he's using it for family visits, which might be seen as important, he's not contributing to the costs. She's given multiple warnings, but he keeps doing it. Then she revokes his permission, which leads to his anger.\n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, it's reasonable for her to expect that if someone is using her car, they should pay for the gas they consume. Especially since the car is her responsibility. He's in a position where he doesn't have his own car, so he's relying on hers. But he's not splitting the costs. That seems unfair. She's tried to communicate the problem each time, but he keeps forgetting or not offering to help. She's taking action to protect her own resources, which is understandable.\n\nHis reaction seems like he's dismissing her concerns and not taking responsibility. Calling her names and bringing up old grudges might be a deflective tactic. The fact that he's never actually followed through on his apologies is a red flag. She's given multiple chances, and he hasn't changed his behavior. So when she finally says no, he's upset, but that doesn't make her wrong. \n\nAnother angle: maybe he should have his own car or find another way to visit his grandma. But he sold his when he went back to university, so maybe that's not feasible. However, he's an adult and should be responsible for his own expenses when using someone else's property. It's not fair to her to bear all the costs without any contribution.\n\nAlso, the cost per trip is $60, and it's happening multiple times. That adds up. She's doing the right thing by setting boundaries. His anger is misplaced because he's the one not respecting her rules. She's not being vindictive; she's trying to protect her own interests. So the answer should be B, no, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
