I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a boyfriend who's borrowing the author's car without contributing to the costs. The car is in the author's name, and they pay for insurance and maintenance. The boyfriend uses the car to visit his grandma, three and a half hours away, each time taking it with a full tank and returning it empty, costing the author $60 each time. He's done this three times, and the author is upset because he doesn't pay for the gas. He promises to remember next time but doesn't. The author warned him multiple times that if it continues, she won't let him borrow the car. When he asks to take it again, she says no, and he gets angry, calling her names.\n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants another opinion. So, the question is whether the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B). \n\nFirst, the boyfriend is using a car that isn't his. He's not contributing to the costs, which seems unfair. The author has a right to set boundaries about how her property is used. Each time he borrows the car, he's draining the gas without reimbursement. The author has given clear warnings, which he ignores. Then, when she enforces her boundary, he reacts negatively. \n\nThe key points are ownership of the car, responsibility for expenses, and communication. The author is the owner, so she should have the final say. The boyfriend's behavior is inconsiderate and not respecting her financial burden. The author's refusal to let him borrow the car after repeated violations is a reasonable response. The boyfriend's anger seems misplaced because he knew the rules and broke them. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
