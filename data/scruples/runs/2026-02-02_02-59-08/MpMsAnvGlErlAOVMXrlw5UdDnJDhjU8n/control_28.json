I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a couple who live together. The boyfriend has borrowed the girlfriend's car multiple times to visit his grandmother, which is 3.5 hours away. Each time, he takes it with a full tank and returns it empty, costing the author $60 each time. The car is the author's, and she's the one paying for maintenance, insurance, and gas. The boyfriend refuses to contribute because it's not his car.\n\nThe author has warned him multiple times that if the behavior continues, she won't let him borrow the car anymore. Now, he wants to take the car again for a weekend trip, and when she denies him, he gets angry, calling her names like juvenile and vindictive.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is wrong. Let's break it down. The boyfriend is using a car that isn't his, which the author owns and pays for. He uses it for trips that are significant in distance, which uses a lot of gas. Even though the car can make the trip on a full tank, he's draining it each time. The author is clearly upset because she's covering all costs, and he's not contributing. She's given multiple warnings, and he hasn't changed his behavior. \n\nThe author's actions in withholding the car are a form of taking back control since he's not respecting her boundaries. She's not forcing him to use her car, but when he does, he's not respecting her ownership. The boyfriend's response seems out of proportion. Getting angry and calling her names when she enforces her decision suggests that he's not taking her ownership into account. \n\nLegally and ethically, the car is hers, so she can set the terms for its use. If he's using it, he should contribute to the costs. The fact that he's not doing so is a problem. The author is trying to communicate her boundaries, and his reaction is dismissive and disrespectful. \n\nSo, the author isn't wrong. The boyfriend is not respecting her property and her feelings. The answer should be B, meaning the author is not in the wrong.\n"
