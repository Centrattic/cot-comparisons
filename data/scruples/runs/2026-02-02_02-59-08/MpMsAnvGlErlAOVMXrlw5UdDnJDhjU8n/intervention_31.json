I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person in the scenario) is in the wrong. The situation involves a boyfriend who borrowed the author's car multiple times, each time leaving it with an empty tank and not contributing to the costs. The author finally says no more borrowing, leading to an argument where the boyfriend accuses her of being juvenile and holding grudges.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend is using the car that the author owns, pays for, and maintains. Even though he's a partner, it's his responsibility to respect her property. Each time he borrows the car, he's using up gas that she has to pay for, and he doesn't replenish it or offer to pay. The author has warned him multiple times, but he ignores the warnings. Now, when he wants to take a trip, the author is denying him access because he hasn't followed the agreed-upon terms. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction is to accuse her of being vindictive and holding grudges. But the author is just trying to protect her own financial interests and set boundaries. The boyfriend isn't contributing to the costs he's causing, which is unfair. The author is standing her ground after repeated issues, which seems reasonable. The boyfriend's behavior is inconsiderate, and the author has every right to enforce her rules. So, the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
