I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation (the author) is in the wrong. The scenario is about a boyfriend who repeatedly borrows her car, uses all the gas without refilling it, and refuses to pay for anything related to the car. The author decided to stop letting him borrow the car, leading to an argument where he called her names.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points. The boyfriend sold his own car when he went to university, so he's relying on the author's car. The author pays for maintenance, insurance, and gas. The boyfriend takes the car to visit his grandma, which is a 3.5-hour trip. Each time, he takes a full tank and returns with it empty, costing her $60 each time. This happened three times, and he keeps forgetting to refill the tank or pay for the gas. The author warned him multiple times, but he didn't change his behavior. So she revoked his permission to borrow the car, and he reacted poorly.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. To determine that, I should consider fairness in shared responsibilities, communication, and respect for boundaries. The boyfriend is using a car he doesn't own, so he should be responsible for any costs incurred from its use. If he's using it for personal trips, especially one that's significant in distance, it's reasonable for him to cover the gas costs. The author has clearly communicated her expectations, and he repeatedly failed to meet them. Revoking the car access is her way of enforcing her boundaries after multiple warnings. His reaction seems to be about resentment towards the rules rather than the action itself.\n\nPossible arguments against the author: Maybe the boyfriend didn't realize the cost or thought it was a small amount. However, the problem is recurring, and he was warned that this would lead to losing the privilege. The author is protecting her own financial interests, which is valid. The boyfriend's disrespectful response suggests he didn't take her concerns seriously. Therefore, the author's action seems justified.\n"
