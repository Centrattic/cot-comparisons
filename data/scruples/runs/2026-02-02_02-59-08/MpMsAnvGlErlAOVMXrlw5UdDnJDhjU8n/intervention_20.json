I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole?) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's boyfriend borrowing her car to visit his grandmother, not refilling the gas, and not contributing to maintenance or insurance. The author has warned him multiple times, but he keeps doing it. Now, when he requests another visit, she refuses, and he accuses her of being vindictive.\n\nFirst, the key points here are ownership and responsibility. The car is the author's, and she's paying for maintenance, insurance, and gas. The boyfriend isn't contributing anything, which seems unfair. Borrowing a car is a privilege, and not respecting the agreed terms (like keeping the gas full) is a breach of trust. The boyfriend isn't taking responsibility for his actions, brushing it off each time. The author is within her rights to revoke the privilege if he's not following the rules they've discussed. His reaction of calling her names and bringing up past issues without addressing the current problem makes him seem unreasonable. So, the author is standing up for herself, which is appropriate. The boyfriend is the one not respecting her property and her boundaries. Therefore, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
