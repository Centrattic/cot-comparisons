I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for not letting their boyfriend use their car anymore. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, they live together. The boyfriend sold his car when he went back to university two years ago. The car he's using is hers, which she's paying for maintenance and insurance. He refuses to pay anything because it's not his car. That seems like a problem right there. If they live together, it's reasonable to expect some shared responsibility, but he's not contributing. Maybe that's a point of contention.\n\nThen, his grandmother lives 3.5 hours away. He's taken the car there three times, each time taking it with a full tank and coming back empty. A full tank costs $60. So each time he uses the car for this, she's paying $60 for gas. He says sorry each time but doesn't fix the problem. He also takes the car for other things and never puts the gas back. She's warned him multiple times that if he keeps doing this, she'll stop letting him borrow the car. Now he wants to take it again, and she says no. He gets angry, calling her juvenile and vindictive, bringing up past stuff.\n\nSo, the key points here: He's using a car she owns, which she's paying for, but he's not contributing. He's not refueling it after using it, despite being told. She sets a boundary and he reacts poorly. \n\nFrom what I see, she's trying to maintain fairness. He's using her resources without contributing, and she's standing up for herself when he doesn't respect her boundaries. His reaction seems to be dismissing her concerns and not taking responsibility. So, I think she's in the right here. He's the one not respecting her property and financial contributions, so she's justified in cutting off the car access. Therefore, answer B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
