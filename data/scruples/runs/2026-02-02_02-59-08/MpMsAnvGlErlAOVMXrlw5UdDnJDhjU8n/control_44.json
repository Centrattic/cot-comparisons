I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a boyfriend who borrows the author's car multiple times, each time taking it with a full tank and returning it empty, costing the author $60 each time. The boyfriend doesn't pay for the gas or maintenance, and the author stops letting him borrow the car after repeated warnings. The boyfriend reacts angrily, accusing her of being mean.\n\nFirst, the car is the author's, so she's paying for it. The boyfriend isn't contributing to costs, which seems unfair. He's using the car for personal trips and not covering expenses. The author gave warnings and then cut off access, which is a reasonable response to someone not respecting her property. The boyfriend's reaction is defensive and dismissive, not acknowledging her concerns. \n\nThe key points are ownership, shared responsibility in a relationship (even if not married), and respect for boundaries. In relationships, it's common to share expenses, especially for shared needs. Since they live together, contributing to car costs might be expected. The boyfriend's refusal to pay despite multiple warnings shows a lack of consideration. The author's decision to stop him from borrowing the car is a logical consequence to protect her own interests. The boyfriend's anger suggests he's not taking accountability. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. She's standing up for her rights and addressing a recurring issue she's tried to resolve. The boyfriend's behavior is the main problem here. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
