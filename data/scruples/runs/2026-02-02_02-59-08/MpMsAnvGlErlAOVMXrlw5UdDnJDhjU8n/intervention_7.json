I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong here. The situation involves the boyfriend using the author's car to visit his grandmother, draining the gas each time without refilling or contributing to costs. The author has warned him multiple times but he keeps doing it. Now he's upset when she refuses to let him use the car anymore.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend is using the car without contributing. The car is the author's, she pays for maintenance, insurance, and gas. He's taking it for trips that are 3.5 hours away, which uses a full tank each time, costing $60. He's done this three times and other times too. Each time, he doesn't refill the tank. The author has told him if this continues, he can't borrow the car. He gets angry and accuses her of being vindictive.\n\nThe key points here are ownership and responsibility. The car is the author's, so she has the right to set the terms of its use. The boyfriend is using her resources without contributing, which is unfair. The author is trying to enforce boundaries after repeated warnings. The boyfriend's reaction is defensive and dismissive, not taking responsibility for his actions. \n\nThe author isn't wrong in refusing to let him use the car when he hasn't followed the agreed terms. The boyfriend's behavior is the issue here\u2014he's not respecting her property and her financial contributions. The author is defending her own interests, which is justified. \n\nSo, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
