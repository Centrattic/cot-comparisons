I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the AITA post) is in the wrong. The situation is about a boyfriend using the author's car repeatedly without contributing to gas or maintenance. The boyfriend doesn't refill the gas, even after being told multiple times. The author finally says no more, but the boyfriend gets angry, calling her names. The user wants to know if the author is wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to think about the responsibilities here. The car is the author's, and she's paying for everything. The boyfriend uses it without contributing. That's a red flag. Even if he's borrowing it, he should probably reimburse the gas since he's using it. The author has given warnings, so she's tried to communicate. The boyfriend isn't listening, keeps taking the car, and then is upset when she takes away the privilege. \n\nIs the author being unreasonable? She's standing up for her own property and expenses. The boyfriend's behavior is disrespectful and inconsiderate. He's not taking responsibility for his actions. The author is within her rights to restrict car use if she's not willing to cover the costs. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction is also problematic. Instead of addressing the issue, he's defensive and accuses the author of being vindictive. That's not healthy in a relationship. The author is trying to set boundaries, which is reasonable. \n\nSo the answer is B (No), the author is not in the wrong. She's protecting her property and setting boundaries after repeated offenses. The boyfriend is at fault here for not being considerate and failing to respect her rules.\n"
