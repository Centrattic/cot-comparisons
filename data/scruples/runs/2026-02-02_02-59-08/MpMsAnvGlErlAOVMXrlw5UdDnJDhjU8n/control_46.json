I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post (the author) is in the wrong for not letting her boyfriend visit his grandma because he's been borrowing her car and draining the gas without refilling it or contributing to the costs. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The boyfriend and the author live together. The boyfriend sold his car and now uses hers. She's the one paying for maintenance, insurance, and gas. Every time he takes the car, even though it's a round trip that can be done on a single tank, he leaves it empty. She's been upset about this, and he just says sorry but doesn't change his behavior. She's threatened to stop letting him borrow the car if this continues, and when he asked again, she followed through. He got angry, accusing her of being vindictive and holding grudges.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider the key points: \n\n1. **Ownership and Responsibility**: The car is hers, so she's the one responsible for all costs. He's not contributing financially. That's a valid concern because using someone else's car shouldn't be free, especially when you're relying on their vehicle for long trips.\n\n2. **Repeated Behavior**: He's done this multiple times, and despite warnings, he hasn't changed. She's given him chances to correct his behavior, but he's not taking responsibility. That seems like a pattern of disrespect towards her property.\n\n3. **Communication and Consequences**: She's communicated her boundaries clearly and followed through when he didn't comply. His reaction (getting upset, calling her names) might indicate he didn't take her concerns seriously. \n\n4. **Fairness**: It's unfair for her to bear all the costs when he's using the car. Even if he's family, using someone else's resources without contributing is reasonable for her to be upset about. \n\n5. **His Response**: His anger and accusations (calling her vindictive) suggest he's defending his actions without acknowledging her valid grievances. That's not a healthy way to handle conflict.\n\nSo, putting it all together, she's not in the wrong. She's standing up for her property and financial boundaries. He's using her resources without contributing, and his behavior is disrespectful. The author's decision to stop allowing him to borrow the car is a reasonable consequence given his repeated failures to comply with her terms. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
