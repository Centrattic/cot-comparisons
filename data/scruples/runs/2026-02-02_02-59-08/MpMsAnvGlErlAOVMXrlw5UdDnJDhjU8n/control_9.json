I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a couple who live together. The boyfriend wants to visit his grandma, but the author is upset because he keeps borrowing her car and not refilling the gas. Each time he takes it, he uses a full tank and comes back empty, costing her $60 each time. He's done this three times, and despite her warnings, he doesn't pay for the gas or refill the tank. Now he wants to take the car again, and she refuses, leading to an argument where he accuses her of being vindictive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ownership and responsibility here. The car is hers, fully paid off, and she's responsible for maintenance and insurance. He's not contributing to the costs, which is a point of contention. When he borrows the car, he's using it for personal trips and not covering any of the expenses. That seems unfair because she's essentially subsidizing his travel.\n\nHe's supposed to return the car with a full tank, but he doesn't. Even after being reminded multiple times, he forgets. This is a repeated issue. The author has set a boundary by saying if he continues, she won't let him borrow the car. When he tries again, she enforces the rule, and he reacts negatively, calling her names. \n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, if someone borrows something that you own and incur costs, especially when they're not contributing to the maintenance, it's reasonable to expect them to cover those costs. Gas is a direct expense, and since the car is his responsibility when he's using it, he should pay for the gas used. His refusal to compensate and repeated failure to refill the tank is inconsiderate and disrespectful. \n\nThe author's response is a consequence for his actions. She's trying to protect her own interests and set boundaries. His reaction is dismissive and accusatory, which doesn't validate his behavior. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for enforcing her rules once he's broken them multiple times. The answer should be B (No).\n"
