I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves the boyfriend borrowing the author's car multiple times without paying for gas or maintenance, leading to the author revoking the privilege. The boyfriend then lashes out.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The boyfriend and author live together. He sold his car when going back to university, so he relies on her car. She's paying for maintenance and insurance, which he refuses to help with. Each time he borrows the car for visits to his grandma, he uses all the gas and doesn't refill it, costing $60 each time. She's warned him multiple times, but he ignores it. Finally, she says no to the next request, and he accuses her of being vindictive.\n\nNow, considering fairness. The car is hers, so she's responsible for all costs. The boyfriend is using it without contributing, which is unfair. He's been warned, so he's aware of her stance. The fact that he continues to not refill the gas despite knowing it's a problem suggests he's inconsiderate. The author's response is to stop letting him use the car, which is within her rights as the owner. His reaction\u2014calling her names and not taking responsibility\u2014highlights his lack of accountability.\n\nPossible counterarguments: Maybe he's in a tough spot financially, but the problem is that he's not even trying to contribute. She's already given him chances to correct his behavior. The boyfriend's refusal to pay and his dismissive attitude show he's not respecting her boundaries. The author isn't wrong for setting those boundaries. Her actions are a reasonable response to his consistent neglect of her needs.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the car is hers, so she's not obligated to let him use it. The boyfriend's complaint about the past grudges is misplaced since the issue is ongoing and unresolved. The author is protecting her own financial interests and the car's usage terms. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
