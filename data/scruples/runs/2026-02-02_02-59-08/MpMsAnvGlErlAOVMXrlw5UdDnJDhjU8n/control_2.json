I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for not letting her boyfriend borrow her car. The boyfriend has borrowed the car multiple times to visit his grandma, each time taking it with a full tank and returning it empty. She's been upset about the gas costs, which add up to $60 each time. He's aware of the issue but doesn't pay for the gas or top it up. She's warned him several times, and now she's decided to stop letting him borrow the car. He got angry, calling her names like juvenile and vindictive.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend is using her car without contributing to the costs. Even though he doesn't own the car, using it incurs expenses. Gas is a shared resource here. He's been told multiple times but hasn't changed his behavior. It seems like he's not respecting her boundaries. She's standing her ground after repeated issues. His reaction is dismissive and disrespectful. \n\nThe key points are: he uses her car without contributing to gas, she's communicated her discomfort, he's ignored her, she's taken action to stop the behavior, he's been abusive in response. Legally, if the car is hers, she can set the rules. Ethically, he's not being considerate of her financial burden. Her action to restrict access is a reasonable response after multiple warnings. His anger is unwarranted, especially since he was the one not following the agreed-upon terms. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. The boyfriend's behavior is the issue here. She's taking a stand for her own resources, which is justified.\n"
