I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the situation is about a couple who live together. The boyfriend has been borrowing the girlfriend's car to visit his grandmother, and each time he takes it with a full tank and returns it empty. The girlfriend is upset because she has to pay for the gas and maintenance, and he doesn't contribute. She's told him multiple times that if he keeps doing this, she'll stop letting him borrow the car. He gets angry when she actually follows through and says she's being unfair.\n\nFirst, I need to consider ownership and responsibility. The car is hers, and she's paying for everything. He's using her car without contributing, which seems unfair. He's been warned multiple times and still doesn't change his behavior. That makes me think he's at fault for not respecting her rules and not taking responsibility. \n\nThen there's the boyfriend's reaction when she revokes the privilege. He accuses her of being vindictive and holding grudges. But she's actually standing up for her own boundaries. If someone uses your property without contributing and ignores your warnings, stopping them suddenly might seem harsh, but it's a reasonable response to protect her own interests. \n\nThe boyfriend's argument that he's sorry and will remember next time hasn't worked, as he keeps repeating the same mistake. So the girlfriend is trying to enforce a consequence, which is fair. The boyfriend's reaction is more about deflection and not taking responsibility. \n\nI think the main issue here is about respecting agreements and taking responsibility. The boyfriend isn't honoring the terms she's set, so the girlfriend is justified in cutting him off. Therefore, the author (girlfriend) is not in the wrong.\n"
