I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a boyfriend who keeps borrowing the girlfriend's car to visit his grandma, but he always leaves it empty on gas without refilling it. The girlfriend is upset because she's paying for gas and maintenance, and she's tried to warn him multiple times. Now she's decided to stop letting him borrow the car, and he's angry, calling her names like juvenile and vindictive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ownership of the car. The car is the girlfriend's, and she's the one paying for everything. The boyfriend doesn't contribute financially because he says it's not his car. That seems like an issue because if he's using the car, even if it's not his, he might be responsible for some costs, especially gas. But he's not paying anything, which could be unfair.\n\nThe boyfriend is borrowing the car to visit his grandma, which is a valid reason, but he's not respecting the terms of the loan. Each time he takes the car, he uses up the gas and doesn't refill it. The girlfriend has warned him multiple times, and he still doesn't change his behavior. This is a pattern of neglect, which is a problem. She's given him chances, but he's not cooperating.\n\nNow, when she finally decides to stop letting him borrow the car, he's upset and accuses her of being petty. The question is whether she's in the wrong. From my perspective, she's standing up for her own property and the costs she's incurring. The boyfriend isn't taking responsibility for his actions, even after warnings. The girlfriend's actions are a reasonable consequence for his repeated failures to follow through.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction seems disproportionate. Calling her names and accusing her of holding grudges when she's actually addressing his consistent behavior. It's his actions that are causing the problem, not her response. She's trying to set a boundary, which is necessary when someone isn't respecting your property.\n\nSo, putting this together, the girlfriend isn't in the wrong. The boyfriend is the one who's not respecting her rules and financial boundaries. Her decision to stop lending the car is justified given his lack of cooperation.\n"
