I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong. The situation involves the boyfriend repeatedly borrowing the author's car without paying for gas or maintenance, and now the author is refusing to let him borrow it anymore. The boyfriend is upset about that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The car is the author's, and she's the one paying for maintenance, insurance, and gas. The boyfriend borrows it multiple times, each time leaving it with an empty tank. The cost per tank is $60, and he's done this three times. The author had warned him that if this continued, she'd stop letting him borrow the car. Then he tried to take it again, and she said no, leading to a conflict where he accuses her of being juvenile and holding grudges.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Let's break it down. The boyfriend is using her car but not contributing to the costs. Legally, if someone else isn't paying for the expenses related to a car they use, that's an issue. The author is setting boundaries because she's not getting reimbursed. When he doesn't heed her warnings, she's removing the privilege, which seems like a reasonable response. His reaction, calling her names and saying she's holding grudges, might be because he feels entitled to use the car without consequence. But from the author's perspective, she's standing up for her own financial interests and boundaries.\n\nAlso, the fact that he sold his car when he went to university means he relies on the author's car. But that doesn't mean she has to let him use it without compensation. He's not offering to pay for the gas or maintenance, which is a valid point. The author is within her rights to set conditions for borrowing the car, like filling up the tank after use. Since he's not following through, stopping the loan makes sense.\n\nThe boyfriend's behavior seems inconsiderate and disrespectful of her ownership. The author is trying to be fair but her boundaries are being ignored. So, the author isn't in the wrong. The boyfriend is the one not respecting her terms and then getting upset when she enforces them. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
