I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a boyfriend and girlfriend living together for three years. The key issue is that the boyfriend borrows the girlfriend's car to visit his grandmother, which is 3.5 hours away. Each time he takes the car, he uses all the gas and returns it empty, costing the girlfriend $60 each time. This has happened three times, and she's now refusing to let him borrow the car anymore. He's upset, calling her vindictive and holding grudges.\n\nThe user initially thinks the author (the girl) is in the wrong but is seeking a second opinion. The task is to determine if the author is in the wrong (A for yes, B for no).\n\nFirst, let's break down the situation. The boyfriend is using the girl's car for long trips, which she owns and maintains. She's paying for gas each time he uses it, but he doesn't contribute. He's aware of her concerns but ignores them, leading her to revoke his access. He responds negatively, accusing her of being juvenile.\n\nLegally and ethically, when someone borrows a car, they're expected to return it in the same condition, which includes a full tank of gas if they took it full. The boyfriend isn't fulfilling this responsibility, causing repeated out-of-pocket expenses for the girl. Communication has been attempted, but he's not heeding her warnings, leading her to take action to protect her own resources.\n\nThe boyfriend's behavior shows a lack of consideration for her financial responsibilities. By not refueling or contributing to the costs, he's essentially making her subsidize his trips. The girl has a right to set boundaries, especially since the car is her property. Revoking the privilege after multiple infractions is a reasonable response, as continued use without addressing the issue would be unfair.\n\nHis reaction\u2014calling her names and accusing her of holding grudges\u2014suggests he's not acknowledging his part in the problem. The girl isn't in the wrong here; she's standing up for her rights and financial well-being. Therefore, the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
