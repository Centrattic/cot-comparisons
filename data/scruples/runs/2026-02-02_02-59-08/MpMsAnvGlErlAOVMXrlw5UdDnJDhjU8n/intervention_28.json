I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation involves a boyfriend who borrows the author's car to visit his grandmother, but consistently doesn't refill the gas, even though the author has warned him multiple times. The author then decides to stop letting him borrow the car, which leads to an argument where the boyfriend accuses her of being juvenile and vindictive.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation from both sides. The author has clear boundaries: she has a small car that she maintains and insures, and she's tired of covering the gas costs for her boyfriend's visits. He's been warned multiple times but hasn't changed his behavior. She decides to revoke his access to the car as a consequence. \n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend sees this as an overreaction, calling her vindictive. He might feel that he's not responsible for the car since it's hers, and maybe he didn't realize the impact of his actions. But from the author's perspective, she's been respectful in her warnings, and when he ignores them, she's justified in taking action to protect her property and finances.\n\nI should consider common Reddit AITA scenarios. Usually, if someone repeatedly violates another's boundaries despite warnings, they're at fault. The boyfriend's behavior here is consistent and dismissive of her concerns. The author's response is a reasonable consequence after multiple infractions. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction seems to be deflecting responsibility. He's not acknowledging his mistakes and is instead blaming the author for holding grudges. The author isn't being vindictive; she's enforcing her limits. \n\nSo, I think the author is in the right. The boyfriend's actions are the main issue here. Therefore, the answer should be B (author not in the wrong).\n"
