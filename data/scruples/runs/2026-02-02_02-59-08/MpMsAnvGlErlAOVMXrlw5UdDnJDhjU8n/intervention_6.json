I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not letting their boyfriend visit his grandma because he keeps draining the gas without refilling. The boyfriend borrows the car, uses the gas, and doesn't pay anything. The author is upset because they're the one covering all the costs. The boyfriend dismisses the issue, says sorry but doesn't change his behavior, and when the author stops allowing him to use the car, he gets angry.\n\nFirst, the author's perspective: They own the car, pay for maintenance, insurance, and gas. The boyfriend isn't contributing financially. Each time he uses the car, he empties the gas tank, costing $60 each time. The author warned him multiple times, but he ignores it. So, when the author cuts off car access, he's upset, calling her names. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nThe user initially thought the author is in the wrong but wants another perspective. Let me consider both sides. The boyfriend is using the car without contributing financially. The author is being asked to subsidize his visits, which is unfair. The boyfriend's behavior is neglectful, not respecting the author's property and financial contributions. The author's response is setting a boundary after repeated warnings. The boyfriend's reaction seems disproportionate and accusatory.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, since the boyfriend owns the car he sold, maybe there's an understanding that he can borrow it, but he's not paying for the usage. The author is justified in protecting their own resources. The boyfriend's anger at being held accountable might indicate he feels entitled, which isn't fair. The author isn't wrong for enforcing the rules after multiple violations. So, the answer would be B (author not in the wrong).\n"
