I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not letting her boyfriend visit his grandma because he keeps borrowing her car and not refilling the gas. \n\nFirst, the boyfriend is living with her, which might imply some shared responsibilities. He sold his car when he went back to university, so he doesn't have a vehicle anymore. The author has her own car, which she pays for entirely. The problem is that every time he takes her car, he uses up all the gas and doesn't refill it. Each time costs $60, and this has happened three times. She's asked him to stop, and he's ignored her. Now, she's refusing to let him borrow the car anymore, and he's upset about it.\n\nThe key points here are consent and responsibility. The boyfriend is using a resource (the car) that isn't his, and he's not covering the costs associated with its use. The author has made it clear that she expects him to refill the gas, but he hasn't followed through despite multiple warnings. When he asks to borrow the car again, she denies him, which he perceives as unfair. \n\nThe boyfriend's argument that he's sorry but doesn't follow through suggests a pattern of disrespecting her boundaries. The author is within her rights to set boundaries, especially since she's shouldering all the financial responsibility. Her decision to revoke his ability to borrow the car after repeated violations seems reasonable. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction\u2014calling her juvenile and vindictive\u2014indicates he's not taking responsibility for his actions. The author isn't in the wrong because she's asserting her ownership and the necessity of mutual respect and accountability in the relationship. The boyfriend's behavior is the issue here, not the author's response to it. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
