I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in their situation with their boyfriend. So, the main issue is about the boyfriend borrowing the car to visit his grandma and not refilling the gas, leading to the author cutting him off.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the facts. They've been together three years and live together. The boyfriend sold his car to go to university, so he doesn't have a car now. The author has a car they pay for, including maintenance and insurance. The boyfriend refuses to contribute, saying it's not his car. He borrows the car to visit his grandma, which is 3.5 hours away. Each time, he takes it with a full tank and returns it empty. A full tank costs $60. This has happened three times. The author is upset because they have to pay for both the car and the gas. The boyfriend apologies but doesn't change his behavior. The author has warned him multiple times, and now the boyfriend wants to go again, so she told him no. He reacted badly, calling her names.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider both sides. \n\nFrom the author's perspective: They are the one who owns and pays for the car. The boyfriend is using it without contributing. The gas cost adds up\u2014each trip costs $60, three times is $180. Even if the car can make the trip on a full tank, he's still using the gas, which the author is paying for. The boyfriend isn't offering to pay for the gas, and when warned, he ignores the warnings. The author is trying to set boundaries and protect their own resources. When he asks to borrow the car again, she refuses, which is a reasonable response after repeated issues. His anger seems to be about her standing up for her own boundaries, not about her being wrong.\n\nFrom the boyfriend's perspective: He might feel that the author is not being understanding, that he's using the car for family visits, which are important. However, he's not contributing to the costs, which is a key point. The author is clear that she won't let him borrow the car anymore because of his lack of accountability. His reaction seems to be about her not allowing him to use the car, which he might see as a loss of a privilege he expected. But he's not sharing the costs, so his expectation might be unreasonable.\n\nIn terms of fairness, if someone borrows a car and uses it for personal trips, it's reasonable to expect them to cover the costs, like gas. The author is asking for that. The boyfriend's refusal to pay or refill the gas is inconsiderate and financially unfair. The author's decision to stop lending the car is a logical consequence after multiple warnings. His anger towards her for enforcing that seems unwarranted. \n\nPossible points to consider: Is there a shared responsibility in a relationship for such expenses? If they live together, maybe they should have a discussion about shared costs. But the car is the author's, and the boyfriend isn't contributing. The author isn't wrong for setting boundaries. The boyfriend's behavior (not paying, ignoring warnings) is the issue here. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They are protecting their own property and financial responsibilities. The boyfriend is at fault for not being considerate and respecting her boundaries. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
