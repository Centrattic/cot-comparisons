I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's boyfriend keeps borrowing her car to visit his grandma, but he always comes back with an empty tank and doesn't pay for the gas. The author has warned him multiple times, and now she's decided to stop letting him borrow the car. He got upset, called her names, and she's wondering if she's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the fairness of the situation. The car is the author's, and the boyfriend isn't contributing to the costs. Each time he uses it, he takes gas, which costs $60 each trip, and he doesn't replenish it. The author has given him warnings, but he keeps doing it. So from her perspective, she's standing up for her property and her finances.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend might feel that visiting his grandma is important and that he's relying on the car for transportation. But the issue is that he's not contributing to the costs. The author isn't asking for him to pay for the entire trip, just to cover the gas or at least refill the tank after using it. Since the car is hers, she has the right to set the terms for borrowing it. If he's not willing to follow those terms, then she's within her rights to revoke the privilege.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction seems to be dismissive and disrespectful. Calling her juvenile and vindictive when she's setting boundaries that she's clearly communicated multiple times. That's not a healthy response, and it suggests that he's not taking her feelings or financial contributions seriously.\n\nSo the key points are ownership of the car, financial responsibility, and communication. The author has tried to address the issue through warnings, and the boyfriend hasn't complied. Therefore, the author's decision to stop letting him borrow the car isn't in the wrong. The boyfriend is the one not respecting her property and boundaries. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
