I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong.\n\nSo, the situation is that the boyfriend and the author live together. He borrowed her car three times to visit his grandma, each time taking it with a full tank and returning it empty. Each time, she's upset about the cost, which is $60 per tank. He says sorry but doesn't fix the behavior. She warned him that if it continues, she won't let him borrow the car anymore. Now he wants to go on a weekend trip, and she refuses because of his past actions. He gets angry, calling her names like juvenile and vindictive.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the fairness of her actions. The car is hers, so she has the right to set boundaries. He's using her resources without contributing, which isn't fair. He's not paying for the car, insurance, maintenance, or gas. Borrowing the car and draining the gas without refilling is a repeated issue she's addressed. She's given warnings, so when he doesn't comply, she revokes the privilege. That seems reasonable.\n\nHe's taking responsibility for his actions? No. He apologizes but doesn't change, which is a pattern. His reaction is anger and blaming her, which is his issue. She's the one standing up for her own boundaries. So, is she in the wrong? Probably not. The answer would be B, No. He's the one being disrespectful with her property and not taking her concerns seriously. Her response is justified to protect her own interests.\n"
