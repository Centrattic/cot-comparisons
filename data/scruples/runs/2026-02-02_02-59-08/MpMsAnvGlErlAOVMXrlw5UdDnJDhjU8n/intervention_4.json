I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a couple where the boyfriend keeps borrowing the girlfriend's car to visit his grandma, not refilling the gas, and not contributing to the costs. The girlfriend eventually stops allowing him to borrow the car, leading to an argument.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The boyfriend has a history of borrowing the car and leaving it with an empty tank. Each time, the gas cost is $60, and he doesn't pay for it. The girlfriend has warned him multiple times, and now she's denying him the car, which he reacts strongly against.\n\nThe main issue here is fairness in financial responsibility. The car is hers, so she's paying for maintenance, insurance, and gas. When he borrows it, he's using her resources without contributing. Even though he's using it for personal trips, the cost falls on her. The boyfriend's refusal to pay anything for the car, even though he uses it, seems selfish. \n\nThe girlfriend's response is to revoke his permission to borrow the car. That's a reasonable action given he's not respecting her terms. His reaction of calling her names and accusing her of holding grudges is unconstructive. \n\nI need to consider if there's any fault on the girlfriend's side. She did give multiple warnings and set boundaries. Her decision to stop lending the car is a direct consequence of his previous behavior. There's no indication she's being unreasonable beyond that. The boyfriend isn't contributing to shared expenses, which is a problem in a relationship. \n\nSo, the author (girlfriend) isn't in the wrong. The boyfriend is not meeting his financial responsibilities for shared resources, leading to the girlfriend's justified response. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
