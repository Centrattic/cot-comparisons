I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a boyfriend who's been borrowing the author's car to visit his grandma and other things, but he doesn't pay for the gas or maintenance, and now the author is refusing to let him borrow the car anymore. The boyfriend is upset, saying she's being vindictive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. They live together, so maybe there's an expectation of shared responsibilities, but the car is the author's, and she's paying for it. The boyfriend is using the car multiple times, each time draining the gas tank and not refilling it. The cost per trip is $60 for gas. The author has warned him several times, and he's not following through. Now she's cutting off his access to the car, and he's angry.\n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, if the car is hers and she's covering all costs, it's reasonable for her to want compensation for the usage. The boyfriend isn't contributing to maintenance or insurance, which are ongoing expenses. Even though the car isn't his, using it for long trips, especially multiple times, without contributing to the costs could be seen as unfair. The author has given warnings, but he's ignored them, leading her to take action.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction of calling her vindictive and bringing up old grudges seems dismissive of her valid concerns. The author's stance is about the recurring issue of unmet responsibilities regarding the car usage. It's about respecting her property and financial contributions. Since he's using a resource he's not paying for, her decision to stop allowing him to use the car is a reasonable response after repeated warnings. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. She's standing up for her boundaries and financial responsibilities. The boyfriend's behavior (not paying for gas despite being asked) is the issue here. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
