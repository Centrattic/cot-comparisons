I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a boyfriend and girlfriend who live together. The key issue is the boyfriend borrowing the girlfriend's car to visit his grandmother, each time leaving it with an empty tank, costing the girlfriend $60 each time. This has happened three times, and the boyfriend refuses to pay for the car's maintenance or insurance, which he isn't even using. The girlfriend has warned him multiple times, but he still doesn't put gas back, and now he's upset when she revokes his permission to borrow the car.\n\nThe user initially thinks the author (the girlfriend) is in the wrong, but wants to know others' opinions. The options are A for yes (she's wrong) and B for no (she's not wrong).\n\nFirst, I need to assess each party's actions. The boyfriend is using the car without contributing to its costs, which is a significant financial burden on the girlfriend. The car is hers, and she's responsible for all expenses. The boyfriend's behavior of not refilling the gas despite promises and warnings is inconsiderate and unfair. The girlfriend has given several chances, but he hasn't changed. Revoking the car use is a reasonable response to protect her own financial interests.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction of calling her juvenile and vindictive is also problematic. He's not taking responsibility for his actions and is dismissing her legitimate concerns. The girlfriend's stance is about her property and finances, which she has the right to manage as she sees fit. The boyfriend's use of the car without contributing is not fair, so her response is justified. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
