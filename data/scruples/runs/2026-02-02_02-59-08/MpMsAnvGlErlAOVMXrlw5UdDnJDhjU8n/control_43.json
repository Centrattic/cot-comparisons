I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation (the author) is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author and her boyfriend living together for three years. The boyfriend borrowed her car multiple times to visit his grandmother, each time taking it with a full tank and returning it empty, which costs around $60 each time. This has happened three times, and despite the author's warnings, the boyfriend hasn't contributed to the maintenance, insurance, or gas costs. After the author finally refuses to let him borrow the car again, he reacts angrily, calling her names and accusing her of holding grudges.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the fairness of the situation. The car is the author's, and she's responsible for all the expenses. The boyfriend isn't contributing financially, which is a key point. Borrowing the car and using up the gas without reimbursement could be seen as unfair. The boyfriend's actions are causing the author financial burden without any compensation or effort to rectify it. \n\nThe boyfriend's response is also important. When confronted, he doesn't take responsibility and instead lashes out, accusing her of being juvenile. This reaction suggests poor communication and a lack of accountability on his part. The author tried to address the issue multiple times before revoking the privilege, which shows she gave him chances to change his behavior. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the boyfriend is using a resource (the car) that he isn't maintaining or paying for. The author's decision to stop letting him borrow the car is a reasonable step to protect her own interests. His anger and accusations seem to stem from his own actions being called out, not from the author being unfair.\n\nPossible counterarguments: Maybe the boyfriend intended to pay for the gas but forgot each time, but there's no evidence he tried to make it up. The author's refusal to allow borrowing the car is a direct consequence of his repeated failures to address the issue. \n\nGiven that, the author isn't in the wrong. The boyfriend's behavior is the main issue here. The answer should be B.\n"
