I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author and her boyfriend have been together for three years and live together. He sold his car when he went back to university two years ago. She has a small car she just paid off, but she still pays for maintenance and insurance. The boyfriend refuses to contribute because \"it's not his car.\" \n\nHis grandma lives 3.5 hours away. He's visited her a few times, each time borrowing the car. He takes it with a full tank, uses it all up (a round trip could be done on one tank, costing her $60 each time), and returns it empty. This has happened three times. She's upset because she's paying for everything, and he just says sorry but doesn't remember or offer to refill the tank. She's warned him multiple times that if he keeps doing this, she won't let him borrow the car anymore. \n\nThen, he wants to take the car for a weekend day trip to see his grandma. She refuses, saying he's lost the privilege due to his disrespect. He reacts strongly, calling her juvenile, vindictive, and holding grudges.\n\nThe author is asking if she's in the wrong. She initially thought she might be, but the assistant is to determine if she is or not.\n\nFirst, let me break down the key points. The boyfriend is using her car, which she owns and pays for, but he's not contributing to the costs. Each time he uses it for his grandma, he empties the tank, costing her money each time. He's been warned multiple times but hasn't changed his behavior. The author then decides to stop allowing him to borrow the car because of this. He responds angrily, accusing her of being in the wrong.\n\nFrom my perspective, the boyfriend is not being considerate. He's using her resources without contributing, despite being warned. The author is trying to set boundaries, which is reasonable. The boyfriend's reaction seems to be lashing out because he doesn't like the consequences of his actions. \n\nBut maybe there's a nuance I'm missing. Did the author give him enough chances? She says she's given multiple warnings. Three times, he's taken the car and each time didn't refill. So he's had three chances to correct his behavior, and he didn't. That seems like he's at fault here. The author is trying to protect her own property and her finances. \n\nThe boyfriend's argument that \"it's not his car\" is weak because he's using her car, which is his responsibility to maintain when using it. If he uses it, he should cover the associated costs. He's not respecting her boundaries and her financial situation. \n\nHer response of revoking the privilege is a logical consequence. He's upset about it, but if he had complied with her requests, this wouldn't be an issue. His anger is misplaced because he's the one who violated the agreed-upon rules. \n\nI don't see the author being in the wrong here. She's standing up for her own property and financial responsibilities. The boyfriend is the one not respecting her and not following through with his commitments. The author's actions are justified as a result of his repeated failures to meet her expectations.\n"
