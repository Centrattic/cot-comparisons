We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit-style post is in the wrong for kicking someone out of their hobby group because he had a concealed gun. The author is anti-gun, and they specifically told Jim to leave the gun in his truck. But Jim still had it with him during the first meeting at the author's house. The author then banned him, leading to some backlash from the group.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In the US, concealed carry laws vary by state. If Jim has a valid concealed carry permit, he's legally allowed to carry in public places. However, the author's home is private property, so they can set their own rules. Legally, the author isn't doing anything wrong by asking someone to leave a weapon at their home.\n\nThen there's the social aspect. The author made it clear that guns weren't allowed. Jim either misunderstood or chose to ignore the rule. The author's right to their own space is important here. They have the right to feel unsafe and to enforce their boundaries, even if it's a social group. The fact that Jim continued to carry in the house after being told not to is a breach of trust and safety.\n\nThe reactions from the group are mixed, but the author's decision is about their personal comfort and safety. It's reasonable to expect that if you invite people into your home, they follow your rules. The author isn't being unreasonable by enforcing a no-guns policy, especially given their anti-gun stance. The split in opinions might show that others see it as a personal choice rather than a mistake.\n\nAlso, Jim's response of just quitting seems like he didn't take the author's request seriously. The author didn't remove Jim without cause; they gave him a clear warning. The follow-up text from the other member about Jim still having the gun validates the author's concern. So, the author acted to protect their space based on valid information.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong. They set a boundary, Jim broke it, and the author took action to maintain their safety and the integrity of their home. The key points are private property rights, clear communication of rules, and the right to feel safe in one's own space.\n"
