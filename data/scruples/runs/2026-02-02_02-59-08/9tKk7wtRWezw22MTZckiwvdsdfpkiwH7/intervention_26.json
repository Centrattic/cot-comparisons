We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a board game group that meets at the author's house. One member, Jim, has a concealed carry permit and initially didn't take the author's request to leave the gun in his truck seriously. The author then kicked Jim out after learning he still had the gun on him during a game night.\n\nThe author's main point is that it's their house and they set the rules. They made it clear they didn't want guns in their home. Jim didn't comply, so they took action. The other group members are split in their reactions. The user initially thought the author is in the wrong but wants to know my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. Concealed carry laws vary by location, but generally, if Jim has a valid permit, he can carry in most public places. However, private property can have different rules. The author's house is private property, so they have the right to prohibit guns there. So legally, the author is within their rights to set that rule.\n\nEthically, it's about personal boundaries. The author made it clear before the event. Jim either misunderstood or didn't take it seriously. The author felt disrespected because Jim didn't follow through. It's a matter of respecting someone's home rules. The author's reaction was to enforce the rule strictly, leading to Jim leaving.\n\nOn the flip side, some might argue that the author overreacted because it's a hobby group and not a high-risk environment. But the author's comfort and safety in their own home are important. The fact that Jim didn't comply after a clear warning might justify the author's decision. The other group members' mixed reactions also show it's a sensitive issue.\n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They communicated their rules, and Jim didn't adhere. It's their house, so they have the right to set boundaries. The answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
