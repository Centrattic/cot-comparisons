We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for kicking someone out of their hobby group because he had a concealed gun. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author hosts a board game group. They moved to their house because it's safer. There are five people, and one is Jim, who has a concealed carry permit. The author knew about the gun but had never mentioned it before. Before the first game night at the author's house, they privately told Jim not to bring the gun, just to leave it in his truck. Jim responded with a non-committal answer.\n\nThen, after the first session, another member told the author that Jim had his gun on him when the author was in the kitchen. The author texted Jim, called him disrespectful, and said he couldn't come if he had the gun. Jim said he wouldn't come again. The group is split on whether the author was right. The author feels it's their house and their rules, and they acted because it's a serious issue, not a minor thing like snacks. Jim is still texting them with conflicting messages.\n\nSo the key points here: the author's house, their rules. Jim had a concealed carry permit, which is legal in many places. The author asked him not to bring the gun, but he did anyway. The author then kicked him out. The author's reasoning is that it's their right to have a gun-free home. Jim might feel that since he has a permit, he can carry, and that the author is being unreasonable. \n\nBut the author did try to address it privately first. When Jim didn't comply, the author enforced their rule. The author is anti-gun, which might influence their feelings, but the right to set house rules is generally accepted. However, some might argue that as long as Jim is legal (with a permit) and not causing trouble, the author is overstepping. But since it's the author's home, they can set boundaries. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author could have handled it differently, like discussing it more before kicking him out. But the situation is that the author made a clear rule, Jim didn't follow it, and the author enforced it. The author is in their right to do that. The mixed reactions from the group suggest it's a gray area, but the author's stance is within their legal rights and personal space. So the answer is probably B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
