We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit-style post is in the wrong for kicking someone out of their hobby group because he had a concealed gun.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The author is hosting a board game group at their house. One member, Jim, has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun. The author is anti-gun but had never mentioned it before. They told Jim privately before the first meeting at their house that no guns would be allowed, and Jim responded in a way that wasn't clearly agreeing. Then, during the event, Jim was still carrying the gun, and another member told the author about it. The author then told Jim he couldn't come back if he brought a gun, leading Jim to quit. The group is split on whether it was fair.\n\nNow, the key points here. The author's house, so they have the right to set rules. The author made it clear beforehand that guns weren't allowed. Jim didn't follow the rule, and the author enforced their rule. But some people think it's a harsh reaction. \n\nBut wait, Jim has a concealed carry permit, which means he's legally allowed to carry. So maybe the author's rule is about not having guns in their home, but Jim's presence with a concealed gun might not violate the law. However, the author's personal comfort and safety are important. Hosting a group in your home allows you to set boundaries, even if they're not legal requirements. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that Jim was respecting the author's initial request by not leaving the gun in his truck, but the author still found out. Maybe there was a communication breakdown. Or perhaps the author didn't make the rule clear enough. But the author did mention it privately before the event. \n\nAlso, the author's reaction was immediate, which some might see as too quick. But if the author is anti-gun, they might feel that any mention of a gun is a deal-breaker. The author is within their rights to remove someone from their property for violating their rules. \n\nSo considering all that, the author is not in the wrong. They set a rule, and someone broke it. The author enforced their rule. Even though Jim had a permit, the author's right to their own property and personal safety takes precedence. The answer is B.\n"
