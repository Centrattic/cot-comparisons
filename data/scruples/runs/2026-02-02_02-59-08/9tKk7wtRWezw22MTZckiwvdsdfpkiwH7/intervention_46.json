We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for removing someone from their hobby group because that person had a concealed gun. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author hosts a board game group at their house. Jim, a member, has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun. The author finds out that Jim brought his gun to the first game night at their house despite being told to leave it in his truck. The author then kicks him out, and the group's reactions are mixed. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides.\n\nLegally, in the U.S., concealed carry laws vary by state, but generally, someone with a permit can carry in public and private spaces unless prohibited. However, the author is the host of their home, so they can set their own rules about guns. If the author made it clear that guns aren't allowed in their home, then Jim bringing a gun would be a violation of those rules. The author has the right to enforce their own property rules, even if it's a personal choice.\n\nEmotionally, the author is anti-gun, which is a valid personal stance. The situation could have been handled differently, like discussing it before the event or giving a warning. But once the rule was broken, the author had the right to remove Jim. The fact that Jim continued to bring the gun despite being asked not to shows a lack of respect for the host's wishes.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author overreacted. Jim didn't physically bring the gun into the house, just kept it on him. But the author's comfort and safety in their home is a significant factor. The author's decision to end the relationship over this is a personal choice, and they have the right to their own space.\n\nThe group's mixed reactions also matter. Some think it's fair, others not. But the key point is the author's right to set boundaries. So, the author isn't in the wrong because they enforced their own rules in their home. The answer should be B.\n"
