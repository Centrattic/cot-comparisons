We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" question is in the wrong for kicking someone out of their hobby group because of a concealed gun. I need to figure out if the author did something wrong here.\n\nFirst, the situation: The group has been meeting at a hobby shop but now moved to the author's house. One member, Jim, has a concealed carry permit and mentioned he's always armed. The author told him privately that guns aren't allowed in their house, so he needs to leave his gun in the truck. Jim responded vaguely. Then, after the first game night at the author's house, it's discovered that Jim kept his gun with him when the author was away. The author texts him, tells him he's disrespectful and he can't come anymore if he has the gun. Jim quits. The group is split on the reaction.\n\nThe author's stance is that it's their house and their rules, and not having guns is reasonable. Jim is now texting back and forth with links to his side.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is wrong. Let's break it down.\n\nIn the US, gun laws vary by state, but generally, if someone has a concealed carry permit, they can carry a gun in public spaces. However, private property owners can set their own rules. So the author, as the host of their own home, has the right to prohibit guns, even if the guest is licensed. That's a key point here. The author made it clear before the event that no guns were allowed. Jim didn't comply, leading the author to kick him out. \n\nBut some might argue that Jim might have felt his rights were violated, especially if he's in a state where he can carry in private properties unless prohibited. The author didn't allow an exception, which could be seen as a personal choice. However, the author's safety and comfort are also important. Since the author explicitly stated the rules beforehand, and Jim didn't follow them, the author's decision to remove him seems justified. \n\nThe other group members are split. One person thinks it's harsh but fair, another that it's not a big deal. But the author's perspective is that it's their house and they have the right to enforce their rules. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong because they're within their rights as a property owner to set such a rule. Jim's choice to carry despite the prior notice is his own decision, and the author's response is a consequence of violating the host's rules. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
