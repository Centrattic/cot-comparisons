We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author of the story is in the wrong for kicking someone out of their hobby group because he was carrying a concealed gun. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author hosts a board game group at their house. One member, Jim, has a concealed carry permit and mentioned he's always armed. The author told Jim beforehand that there shouldn't be guns in the house, so he needs to leave his in the truck. Jim gave a somewhat non-committal response. Later, it's revealed that Jim still had his gun with him during the game night. The author then tells Jim he can't come anymore if he's armed, and Jim quits. The group is split on whether the author was right.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author was wrong to do this. Let's look at the key points. The author is in their own home, so they have the right to set rules. Concealed carry laws vary by location, but generally, carrying a gun is legal if you have the permit. However, the author explicitly told Jim their policy. Jim then violated that policy, even if he thought it was okay to have the gun on him. The author's response was to remove him from the group, which is understandable since it's their space.\n\nNow, considering different perspectives. Jim might argue that he's within his legal rights to carry, but the author's right to their home takes precedence. The author made their expectations clear beforehand, and Jim didn't comply. The other group members' reactions are mixed, but the majority seem to side with the author. The author isn't being mean just for the sake of it; it's a safety and personal boundary issue. Even if Jim felt it was unreasonable, the author has the right to enforce their rules. \n\nAlso, the fact that Jim kept texting back with mixed messages after being asked to leave might indicate he wasn't respectful of the author's decision. The author's point about it being a serious matter compared to something trivial like snacks makes sense. They addressed it immediately after the first incident, which is responsible. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. They communicated their rules, Jim didn't follow them, and the author took appropriate action to maintain their comfort and safety in their own home. The answer should be B (No).\n"
