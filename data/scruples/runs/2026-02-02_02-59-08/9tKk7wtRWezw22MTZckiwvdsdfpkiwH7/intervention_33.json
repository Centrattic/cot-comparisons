We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for kicking someone out of their hobby group because he had a concealed gun. The author is anti-gun but didn't mention this before. They told Jim privately that guns weren't allowed in their house, and Jim acknowledged. Then later, when Jim still had the gun, the author kicked him out.\n\nHmm. So, first, it's the author's house, so they have the right to set their own rules. But Jim had a concealed carry permit, which means he's legally allowed to carry a gun. The problem is whether he was aware of the rules. The author told him privately, but maybe Jim thought he could still carry it if he didn't act on it. The author might have been clear enough, but maybe the response wasn't. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that it's their house and they set the rules. But some people might argue that Jim was within his legal rights and the author overreacted. However, others might support the author's stance because it's a personal space, and they have the right to feel safe. The group's split reactions also indicate different opinions. \n\nThe key points: legality of concealed carry, personal safety and comfort, and the right to set house rules. Since it's the author's home, they can enforce their own rules regardless of Jim's rights in public. The author addressed it after one incident, which some might see as strict, but others as necessary. The answer depends on whether the author's actions are considered reasonable given the context. I think the author isn't in the wrong because they have the right to their own space and made their rules clear upfront. So the answer is B.\n"
