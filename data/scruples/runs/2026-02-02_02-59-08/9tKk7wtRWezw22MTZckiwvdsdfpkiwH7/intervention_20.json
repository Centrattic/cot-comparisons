We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for kicking someone out of their hobby group because he was carrying a concealed gun. The author mentions that they are anti-gun and made it clear beforehand that no guns should be in their house. Jim, the guy with the permit, was carrying the gun despite the author's request. Then, after the author found out he was still carrying it during the first game night at their home, they told him he couldn't come back if he was armed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. Concealed carry laws vary by location. In some places, people with permits can carry in private homes unless the homeowner explicitly prohibits it. If the author made it clear that no guns are allowed, then Jim might have been in violation. However, if Jim believed he had the right to carry in his own home, but the author's home is different, that could be a point of contention. But the author's own home rules usually take precedence unless there's a law that overrides that.\n\nNext, the social dynamics. The author set a boundary before the event, which is a reasonable step. Jim didn't comply, which led to the author enforcing their rule. The author's stance is about personal safety and comfort, which are valid concerns. The fact that one other group member thinks the author is being a \"shrew\" doesn't necessarily mean they're wrong; it's a matter of differing opinions.\n\nJim's response was to quit, which is his choice. The author isn't forcing him to leave but is upholding their own rules. The text messages show the author communicated directly, and Jim didn't follow through with the agreement. The author isn't in the wrong for enforcing their own rules, especially when they were clear from the start. The others in the group have mixed reactions, but that doesn't make the author wrong. It's about the host's right to their own space and safety preferences.\n"
