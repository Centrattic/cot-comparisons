We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for kicking someone out of their hobby group because of a concealed gun. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the setup: they have a board game group that moved to the author's house. One member, Jim, has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun. The author told Jim privately that they don't want any guns in their house, so he should leave it in his truck. Jim responded in a way that wasn't exactly confirming, and later, another group member told the author that Jim had his gun with him during the event. The author then told Jim he couldn't come anymore because of this, leading to Jim leaving the group. The group reactions are mixed.\n\nThe author's main point is that it's their house and their rules. They don't think it's unreasonable to not want a gun in their home. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nI need to consider a few things. First, legal aspects: in the US, gun laws vary by state. Concealed carry laws differ, but generally, if someone has a permit, they can carry. However, private property owners can set their own rules. So, the author is within their rights to prohibit guns in their home, even if Jim has a permit. So legally, the author isn't wrong.\n\nEthically, it's a different angle. The author is anti-gun, which is their personal belief. Jim was aware of the rule and didn't follow it. The author stood by their rule, which is their right as a host. Some might argue that it's a personal choice and the author shouldn't have to host someone they're uncomfortable with. Others might say it's a bit of a harsh reaction for one incident. But the author did communicate their rules before the event and gave Jim a chance to comply. When Jim didn't follow through, the author enforced the rule. \n\nThe reactions from the group are mixed. One person doesn't care, one thinks it's harsh but fair, and one thinks the author was too uptight. That suggests that there's no clear consensus, but the author's stance is defensible. The fact that Jim had a history of carrying and the author made it clear that guns weren't allowed means that the author isn't being unreasonable. The author is responsible for their own home's safety and setting boundaries. \n\nSo considering all this, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). They had the right as a host to set the rules, communicated them, and enforced them when violated. Jim's choice to not comply led to his own decision to leave, so the author isn't at fault here.\n"
