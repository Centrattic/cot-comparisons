We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about someone who kicked another member out of their hobby group because he had a concealed gun in the house during a game night. The author is anti-gun but didn't mention it before. The key points here are ownership of the house, the rules set by the host, and the reactions of the group.\n\nFirst, the author made it clear before the first meeting at their house that they didn't want any guns there. Jim was told privately to leave his gun in his truck. But then, after the first session, another member told the author that Jim had his gun with him while they were in the kitchen. The author then texted Jim, saying he was disrespectful and banning him. Jim quit the group.\n\nNow, considering that it's the author's house, they have the right to set the rules for their own property. Even though Jim has a concealed carry permit, which is legal, the author is within their rights to prohibit guns in their home. The issue here is about personal boundaries and comfort. The author was clear about their stance before the event, so Jim should have followed the rule. However, he didn't, which led to the author enforcing the rule by asking him to leave.\n\nThe reactions from the group are mixed. Some think it's fair, others think it's harsh. But the author's main point is that it's their house and they can set the rules. The fact that Jim continued to carry the gun despite being told not to could be seen as a violation of the host's rules. So, from a legal and personal safety standpoint, the author isn't in the wrong. They made their expectations clear and followed through when the rule was broken. Jim's continued presence with a gun might have been a risk the author wasn't willing to take, especially since it's their home. Therefore, the author's decision seems justified based on their right to control their own property and safety.\n"
