  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for kicking a guy out of my hobby group because of his concealed gun?\nI am in a little board game group that has been meeting regularly for the past six months. We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a board game group that meets at the author's house. One member, Jim, has a concealed carry permit and brings his gun. The author told him privately not to bring it, but Jim still did, and then the author kicked him out. The author is asking if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, the author's house. So it's their space, right? They have the right to set rules for their home. Guns can be a sensitive topic. The author is anti-gun, which is their personal belief. They told Jim upfront that guns aren't allowed in their house. Jim was aware, but still kept his gun with him during the event. The other group members have mixed reactions, but the key here is that it's the author's house. \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, as the homeowner, the author can establish rules. If someone violates those rules, they can ask them to leave. The author gave a clear warning before the first meeting at their house. Jim didn't comply, and then the author followed through. That seems like a reasonable response. \n\nBut maybe some might argue that Jim had a permit and that he was just carrying as per the law. However, the author's home is their private property, and even if Jim is legally allowed to carry elsewhere, the homeowner can prohibit it on their premises. So the author isn't violating any laws by asking him to leave. \n\nThe other members' reactions are split, but the author isn't wrong for enforcing their own boundaries. It's a personal choice, not a matter of right or wrong. The author handled it respectfully by talking to Jim privately first. Then when he broke the rule, they took action. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They had the authority to set the rule and enforce it when it was broken.\n"
