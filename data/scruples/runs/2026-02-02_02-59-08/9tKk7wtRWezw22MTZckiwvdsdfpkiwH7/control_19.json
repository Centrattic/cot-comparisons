We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for kicking someone out of their hobby group because of a concealed gun. The scenario is that the group is now meeting at the author's house, and Jim, who has a concealed carry permit, was told by the author to leave his gun in his truck. However, Jim ended up keeping his gun with him during the first meeting at the house, leading the author to kick him out.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. Concealed carry laws vary by location, but generally, in places where concealed carry is legal, individuals can carry guns in private homes with the owner's permission. The author told Jim to leave the gun in the truck, so if Jim was carrying it in the house without permission, that's a violation of the author's rules. But if Jim had a permit, maybe he's allowed to carry in the home? Wait, but the author set the rule. If the author is the homeowner and says no guns in the house, then Jim's presence with a gun there without consent would be against the rules. So legally, the author has the right to set their own house rules.\n\nThen there's the social aspect. The author is anti-gun, which is a personal right. They made their rules clear. Jim didn't follow them. The author acted on it by excluding him, which is their right as the host. However, some might argue that the author overreacted. But the user's question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The author's reasoning is that it's their house and they set the rules. Since Jim didn't comply, the author enforced the rule. Others in the group are split, but that doesn't necessarily mean the author is wrong. \n\nAlso, Jim's response was to quit, so it's a mutual understanding. The author didn't kick him publicly; Jim left himself after being told. The author's actions were a direct consequence of Jim violating the agreed-upon rules. So from a standpoint of ownership and personal safety, the author is justified. Therefore, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
