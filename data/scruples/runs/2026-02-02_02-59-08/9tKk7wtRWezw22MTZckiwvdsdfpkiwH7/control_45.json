We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who posted the situation) is in the wrong for asking someone to leave their hobby group over a concealed gun.\n\nFirst, the key points: The group moved to the author's house, and Jim, who has a concealed carry permit, was told to leave his gun in his truck. But during the first game night, he kept his gun with him when the author was out of the room. The author then told Jim he couldn't come back if he was armed, leading Jim to leave the group.\n\nThe author's main argument is that it's their house, so they set the rules. Jim, however, might feel that since he's legally allowed to carry, the author is being unreasonable. But the author had clearly communicated the rule beforehand. Jim didn't follow through, and the author enforced the rule after the fact.\n\nLegally, the author has the right to establish rules for their home. Even if Jim has a permit, the homeowner can decide not to allow guns on their property. The author gave a warning first, then followed up when the rule was broken. The split reactions in the group suggest that opinions vary, but the author's stance seems justified based on their own property rights and the prior agreement.\n\nSo the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They had the right to set the rule and enforce it when it was violated. Jim's continued presence with the gun after being asked not to bring it in is the issue here.\n"
