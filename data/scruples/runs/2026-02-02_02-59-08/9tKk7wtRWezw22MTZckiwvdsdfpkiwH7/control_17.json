We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for kicking someone out of their hobby group because he had a concealed gun. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author hosts game nights at their house. They specifically told Jim, who has a concealed carry permit, that he needs to leave his gun in his truck. Jim acknowledged this, but later, another group member found out that Jim still had his gun when the author wasn't around. The author then texted Jim, told him he was disrespectful, and said he couldn't come anymore if he had a gun. Jim left, and now the author is getting mixed reactions from the group.\n\nThe author's main point is that it's their house and they set the rules. They didn't like that Jim didn't follow their rule about not having a gun present. Jim responded by leaving the group. The other group members are split on whether the author was right.\n\nSo, legally, the author has the right to set rules for their own home. If Jim was aware of the rule and broke it, the author can enforce that. However, part of the issue is whether the author overreacted. The author gave a clear warning before the event, and the second time Jim didn't comply, the author acted. But some might argue that one instance isn't enough, or that the author didn't give a second chance. Others would agree that the author is within their rights to remove someone for breaking house rules, especially regarding something as serious as guns.\n\nEmotionally, the author is anti-gun, which adds to their sensitivity. They might feel their safety is compromised even if Jim was legally allowed to carry. But others might think that since Jim had a permit and was following the law, the author is being overly cautious.\n\nThe key points here are ownership of the space and the nature of the rule. The author made their rule clear, and Jim didn't follow it. The author then took action, which is their right. However, maybe the author could have handled it differently, like giving a verbal warning first. But based on the information given, the author's actions were in line with their own rules, so they're not in the wrong. The answer should be B (No).\n"
