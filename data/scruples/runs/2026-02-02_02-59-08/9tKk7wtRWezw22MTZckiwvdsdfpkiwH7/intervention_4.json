We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (me in the scenario) is in the wrong for kicking someone out of a hobby group because he was carrying a concealed gun. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The group used to meet at a hobby shop but now switched to the author's house. Jim, one of the five members, has a concealed carry permit and mentioned he always carries a gun. The author told Jim privately that they don't want guns in their house, so he should leave it in his truck. Jim's response wasn't a clear agreement. Then, during the first meeting at the house, Jim still had the gun on him when the author was in the kitchen. The author confronted Jim, told him it was disrespectful, and asked him to leave the group. Jim quit. Others in the group have mixed reactions. The author now feels justified because it's their house and rules, but others think it was harsh.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author set a rule beforehand, Jim didn't follow it, and the author enforced it. But was that overreacting?\n\nLegally, the author's house, so they can set their own rules. But in terms of social dynamics and tolerance, maybe there's a different angle. The author asked Jim to leave the gun in his truck, but Jim didn't comply. The author then took action after the first incident. The question is whether that action was justified.\n\nJim had a concealed carry permit, so he's within his legal rights to carry. However, the author is anti-gun and made their stance clear. The problem might be that the author communicated the rule but didn't get a clear agreement from Jim. Jim's response was \"acknowledging but not exactly affirming,\" which is ambiguous. So, maybe the author assumed Jim would follow through, but Jim didn't, leading to the confrontation.\n\nFrom a social standpoint, is it reasonable to expect someone to leave a legal item in their truck when entering a private home? The author might feel that guns are a safety issue or a personal comfort issue. However, Jim might have felt that if he's allowed to carry in public places (like the hobby shop), it's reasonable to carry at someone's home unless explicitly stated. The author did state it, but maybe Jim thought it was an unreasonable request, hence the non-committal response.\n\nThe author's action of asking Jim to leave the group is a strong reaction. But again, it's their house. The group's mixed reactions show that some see it as justified, others as too harsh. The question is whether the author was in the wrong. Since the author made their rules clear and Jim violated them, the author might be in the right to enforce it. However, maybe the author could have handled it differently, like discussing it more with Jim before excluding him. But given the situation, the author's decision to set boundaries in their own home is understandable.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is probably B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The author has the right to set rules for their home, and if someone doesn't follow them, they can be asked to leave. The author's stance on being anti-gun is a personal choice, and enforcing that in their own space is reasonable.\n"
