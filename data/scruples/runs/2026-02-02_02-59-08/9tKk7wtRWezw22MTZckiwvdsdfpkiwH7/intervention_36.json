We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. Let's break down the situation.\n\nThe author hosts a board game group, and one member, Jim, has a concealed carry permit and brings his gun to meetings. The author tells Jim privately that they don't want guns in their house, so Jim should leave it in his truck. Jim's response isn't a clear agreement. Later, another group member tells the author that Jim still had the gun with him during a session. The author then texts Jim, saying he's being disrespectful and can't come anymore if he has a gun. Jim quits. The group reactions are mixed. The author believes it's their house and their rules, not unreasonable. Jim keeps texting, then threatening to cut contact.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. Need to decide if the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B).\n\nFirst, legal aspect: Concealed carry laws vary by location. If Jim is legally allowed to carry, does the author have the right to ban him from their home? Typically, in the U.S., private property owners can set rules about firearms on their land. So even if Jim is legally allowed elsewhere, the host can enforce a no-firearms rule on their property. So the author has legal standing here.\n\nEthically, it's about personal boundaries. The author made it clear before the event that guns are not allowed. Jim either didn't comply or wasn't clear on the agreement. The author's action is to enforce their own safety and comfort. They're not violating any laws, just enforcing their home rules. The fact that they addressed it after the first incident and then kicked Jim out seems reasonable. Jim's response was to quit, which is his choice.\n\nThe other group members have mixed reactions, but the author's stance is about their own space. The user's own opinion is that the author is wrong, but based on analysis, the author is within their rights and acting on their personal comfort. So the answer should be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong).\n"
