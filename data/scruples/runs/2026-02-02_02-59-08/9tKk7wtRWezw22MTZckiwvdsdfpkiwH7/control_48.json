We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for kicking someone out of their hobby group because he was carrying a concealed gun to their house.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author hosts a board game group that has moved to their home. One member, Jim, has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun. The author told Jim in advance that guns aren't allowed in their home. Jim responded with an acknowledging but not exactly confirming reply. Then, after the first session, another member revealed that Jim was still carrying the gun when the author was out of earshot. The author then told Jim he couldn't come anymore if he had a gun, leading to Jim quitting. The group's reactions are split.\n\nNow, the key points here are about personal boundaries and safety. The author made it clear their house is gun-free. They addressed the issue directly when they found out Jim was carrying the gun despite the prior agreement. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, as the homeowner, the author has the right to set rules for their property. If someone is in violation of those rules, they can be asked to leave. Jim was aware of the rule but continued to carry the gun, which the author found unacceptable. The author's action was to enforce their own safety rules, which is a personal choice. Others in the group have mixed reactions, but that doesn't necessarily make the author wrong. The author's stance is about their comfort and safety, which is valid.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the author overreacted, especially since Jim had a permit and the group had been meeting before without issues. But the author emphasized the importance of the rule, which is their right. Since the situation involves personal safety and the author made clear expectations, it seems justified. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
