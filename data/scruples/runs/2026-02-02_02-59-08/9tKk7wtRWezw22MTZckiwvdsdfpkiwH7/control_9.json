We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a board game group where one member, Jim, carries a concealed gun. The author, who hosts the game nights at their house, told Jim upfront that no guns are allowed. Jim didn't explicitly confirm but later mentioned to another member that he still had his gun during a session. The author then kicked him out, and there's mixed reactions from the group.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In the US, concealed carry laws vary by state. If Jim has a valid permit, he's legally allowed to carry in public places, but private property can have different rules. The author's house is private property, so they have the right to set rules. However, some states have \"castle doctrine\" laws where homeowners can deny entry for certain reasons, but it's not about the gun itself after someone is allowed in. Wait, but if someone is invited into a home, does the owner have the right to ask them to leave their gun in the car? It depends on state law. For example, in some states, you can ask someone to leave if they refuse to comply with a reasonable rule, even if they have a permit. So the author's action might be legally justified.\n\nEthically, the author feels uncomfortable with guns, which is a personal right. They set the rule clearly before the event. Jim didn't follow through, possibly misunderstanding or not taking it seriously. The author acted in their own comfort and safety, which is reasonable. But Jim might argue that he's within his legal rights and the author overreacted. However, since it's the author's house, they have the authority to enforce their rules. The aftermath of Jim's continued contact (texting) complicates things, but that's more about how he handled the situation post-kickout.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The author isn't in the wrong because they set clear expectations, and as the host, they have the right to enforce their rules for their own safety and comfort. Even if Jim's actions were legal in other contexts, the private property rule applies here. The other group members' mixed reactions don't change the fact that the author's decision was based on their own boundaries.\n"
