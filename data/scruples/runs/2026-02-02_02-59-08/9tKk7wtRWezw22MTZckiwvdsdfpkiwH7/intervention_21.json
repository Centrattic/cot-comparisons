We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the Reddit-style post is in the wrong for kicking someone out of their hobby group because he carried a concealed gun to their house. The author is anti-gun and set a rule beforehand that guns aren't allowed in their home. Jim didn't comply, so the author asked him to leave, and he quit.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author owns their home and has the right to set rules for their space. They communicated this to Jim before the first event. Jim then broke that rule by keeping his gun on him, which the author found out through another member. The author then told Jim he couldn't come anymore, leading to Jim leaving.\n\nLegally, in the U.S., concealed carry laws vary by state. If Jim is legally allowed to carry in that area, even in a private residence, it could be a legal gray area. But the author is focusing on their personal comfort and safety. The argument here is about personal boundaries versus legal rights.\n\nThe author's perspective is that it's their house and their rules. They made it clear beforehand. Jim didn't follow through, so the author enforced the rule. From a personal space standpoint, that's reasonable. However, some might argue that if Jim is legally allowed to carry, the author could have other options instead of banning him outright, like hosting the event elsewhere or having a policy that only allows guns in locked containers in a separate area. But the author didn't do that and chose to enforce a strict no-guns rule.\n\nThe other group members are split. One thinks it's fair, another thinks it's harsh but acceptable, and one disagrees. That shows there's room for differing opinions. The author's decision might be seen as within their rights, but some might see it as overreacting if Jim was just following the law.\n\nBut the core issue is the author's right to their own space. Even if Jim was legally allowed, the author can set their own rules for their home. The problem is whether the author overstepped by not allowing exceptions or considering alternatives. However, the author didn't mention other options, so from their perspective, enforcing the rule was necessary for their comfort.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong because they have the right to set rules in their home. Even if Jim is legally allowed to carry, the author's decision to ask him to leave for violating their rule is their prerogative. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
