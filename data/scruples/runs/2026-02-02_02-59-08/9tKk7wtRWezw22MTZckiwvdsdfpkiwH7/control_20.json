We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for kicking someone out of their hobby group because he had a concealed gun at their house.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author hosts a board game group at their home. One member, Jim, has a concealed carry permit and mentions he's always armed. The author told Jim upfront that guns aren't allowed in their house and asked him to leave it in his truck. Jim didn't confirm he would do that. Then, during the first game night, another member told the author that Jim had the gun on him while they were in the kitchen. The author then told Jim he couldn't come anymore if he had the gun, leading Jim to quit.\n\nThe author's perspective is that it's their house and they set the rules. They consider this a serious issue. The group's reactions are mixed. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, in the U.S., concealed carry laws vary by state. If Jim has a valid permit, he might be legally allowed to carry in certain places, but private property owners can usually set their own rules about firearms. So the author, as the homeowner, has the right to prohibit guns on their property. Legally, the author isn't in the wrong here.\n\nMorally, it's about personal comfort and safety. The author is anti-gun, so having a gun in their home could make them uncomfortable. They made their rules clear before the event, so Jim knew the expectation. Jim not following through by keeping the gun in his truck but having it on him during the event is a breach of the agreed-upon rules. The author acted to enforce their own space's rules. \n\nJim's reaction of just quitting without confrontation might indicate he knew he was violating the rules. The author's decision to remove him is within their right as the host. The group's mixed reactions don't necessarily mean the author is wrong; it's more about differing opinions on how strict to be about such matters.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. They set clear expectations, and Jim didn't comply. The author has the right to enforce their rules in their own home. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
