We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a board game group that moved to the author's house. One member, Jim, has a concealed carry permit and usually carries a gun. The author told Jim not to bring the gun into their house, but Jim ended up keeping it with him anyway. The author then kicked Jim out of the group. Now, the group is split on whether the author was right.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In many places, concealed carry laws allow people to carry guns in public, but private property can have rules. The author's house is private property, so they can set their own rules. If Jim was aware and agreed to leave his gun in his truck, but then brought it in anyway, that's a breach of the agreement. Legally, the author can ask him to leave if he violates their house rules.\n\nFrom a safety perspective, even if Jim is legally allowed to carry, the author has a right to feel unsafe. Guns can be a sensitive issue, and the author's decision to ban them from their home isn't unreasonable. It's their space, and they can prioritize their comfort and safety.\n\nJim's actions might be seen as disrespectful. He agreed to the rule but didn't follow through, which could be seen as a breach of trust. The author handled it by setting clear boundaries, which is reasonable. However, some might argue that the author could have given Jim a second chance or communicated differently. But since it's their house, enforcing the rule immediately isn't necessarily wrong.\n\nThe group's mixed reactions show different perspectives. One person thinks it's harsh but fair, another doesn't care, and another thinks the author was too uptight. But the key point is the author's right to their own space. Unless there's a violation of law, the author's decision is about personal boundaries.\n\nSo, considering all factors\u2014legal right to private property, safety concerns, and respecting the author's personal space\u2014it seems the author was justified in their actions. Therefore, they are not in the wrong.\n"
