We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for kicking someone out of their hobby group because of a concealed gun. The situation is the author doesn't want guns in their home, and they told Jim upfront that he needed to leave his gun in the truck. But Jim still had it with him during the game night and was in earshot. The author then kicked him out, and the group is split on the reaction.\n\nSo, the key points here. The author made it clear that no guns in their house. Jim had a concealed carry permit but didn't follow the rule. The author's stance is about their own home rules. Legally, concealed carry laws vary, but the author is within their rights to set rules for their property. Even if Jim had a permit, the homeowner can establish conditions. The author acted because they don't want guns in their home, which is their personal right. Jim didn't comply, so the author enforced the rule. The user initially thought the author was in the wrong, but I think the opposite. The author isn't violating anything by setting boundaries. Jim had prior knowledge, but still didn't follow through. The author's decision is about personal comfort and safety in their own home. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
