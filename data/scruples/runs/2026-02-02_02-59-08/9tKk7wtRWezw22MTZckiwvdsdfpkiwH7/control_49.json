We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a board game group where the author asked someone named Jim to leave his gun in his truck instead of bringing it to the author's house. Jim didn't comply, and the author kicked him out of the group.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author owns their home and has the right to set rules about what's allowed there. Guns are a sensitive topic, and being anti-gun is a personal stance. The author communicated their rule to Jim privately before the first meeting at their house, so Jim was aware. However, Jim still brought the gun into the house. The author then confronted him after the fact and told him he couldn't come anymore if he had a gun on him. \n\nJim's response was to stop attending, so he didn't get kicked out in front of others, but the author initiated the exclusion. The rest of the group is split on whether it was harsh or fair. The author's reasoning is that their house has specific rules, and they wanted to maintain a safe environment for their friends. \n\nNow, legal aspects: in the US, the Second Amendment allows gun ownership, but laws regarding carrying guns in private property vary. If the state allows concealed carry, the property owner can typically prohibit guns on their premises. So the author might have the legal right to ask Jim to leave the gun outside. \n\nBut there's also the social aspect. The author chose to make it a rule, which is their right. However, some might argue that the author was overreacting if Jim had never caused issues before and the other members didn't share the same concern. But the author's comfort in their own home is important. \n\nJim's response of bringing the gun despite being told not to might be seen as a breach of trust. The author had to set boundaries, and enforcing them once was necessary to maintain their safety and the group's trust. \n\nThe question is whether the author was in the wrong. The author acted within their rights as the homeowner to enforce their rules. Even though others in the group are split, the decision was based on personal safety and comfort. The author didn't make a big deal in front of the group, just communicated the consequence to Jim directly. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they have the right to their own home's rules and addressed the issue appropriately.\n"
