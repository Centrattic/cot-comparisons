We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for kicking someone out of their hobby group because of his concealed gun. \n\nFirst, the situation: the author hosts board game nights at their house. One member, Jim, has a concealed carry permit and usually carries a gun. The author told Jim beforehand that no guns are allowed at their house. Jim responded in a way that wasn't clearly agreeing. Then, during the first session at the author's house, Jim still had his gun when the author was away. The author then told Jim he couldn't come anymore if he had the gun. Jim quit the group. Some group members think the author was right, others think it was harsh.\n\nSo, the main points here are about personal boundaries and safety. The author made their rule clear. They don't want guns in their home. Even if Jim has a permit, the author has the right to set rules for their own property. The fact that Jim didn't comply after being told directly is a problem. The author is prioritizing their comfort and safety, which is valid. Others might argue it's a free country and Jim's rights are being infringed, but since it's private property, the host can set those rules. Also, Jim's actions were a direct violation of the given rule. The author's response was to enforce their boundary. The fact that the group is split shows that it's subjective, but the key here is that the author's home is their space, and they can decide who can be there based on their comfort. So, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
