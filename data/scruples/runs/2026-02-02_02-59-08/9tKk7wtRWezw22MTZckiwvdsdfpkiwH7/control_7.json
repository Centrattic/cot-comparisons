We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a board game group that meets at the author's house. One member, Jim, has a concealed carry permit and brings a gun. The author is anti-gun and asked Jim to leave his gun in his truck. Jim didn't exactly confirm he would do that. Then later, someone told the author that Jim was still carrying the gun during the game night when the author was in the kitchen. The author then told Jim he couldn't come again if he had a gun, leading Jim to quit.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. If Jim has a concealed carry permit, he's legally allowed to carry a gun in public places. But when he's in someone's private home, the rules might be different. In many places, even if you have a permit, the homeowner can set their own rules. So the author, as the homeowner, might have the right to prohibit guns in their home. That's a key point.\n\nThen there's the social dynamics. The author's main concern is safety and comfort in their own home. They mention being anti-gun, so it's a personal issue. They gave a heads-up before the first meeting at their house, which is reasonable. Jim didn't explicitly agree to leave his gun in the truck, which could mean he ignored the request. The author then acted when they found out he still had the gun there. They put their foot down, which is about enforcing their own boundaries. \n\nThe group reactions are mixed. One person doesn't care, another thinks it's harsh but fair, and another is annoyed. But the main question is about the author's right to set the rules. Since it's their house, they can choose who they want to have in their home. Jim's continued presence with a gun after being asked to leave it in the truck might be seen as a violation of the host's rules. \n\nHowever, there's a nuance here. If Jim was exercising his legal right by carrying in his own vehicle (assuming it's allowed there), maybe the author's rule is about the gun being on the premises, even if it's in his truck. But the author's statement was about not wanting guns in their house, so maybe the issue was that Jim was still in the house with a concealed gun. If the author's rule is that guns aren't allowed in the house at all, then Jim following their permit to carry in public (if the house is considered private) could be a problem. \n\nThe author's text message says that Jim was \"extremely disrespectful\" for not following the rule the first time. The response from Jim was to quit, so the author's action led to his departure. The author might be in the right because it's their home and they can enforce their policies. But some might argue that Jim had a permit and felt it was necessary for his safety, even in a private residence. However, the author didn't ask Jim to disarm entirely, just to leave the gun in the truck. \n\nAdditionally, Jim's continued texting back with propaganda might indicate he's making this a bigger issue than it is, which supports the author's stance that it's a serious matter. The author's actions were based on a prior agreement and the enforcement of it when violated. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's decision to kick Jim out might be justified under the premise of setting house rules. The disagreement here is more about personal values and safety rather than a clear right or wrong. Since the author made their rules clear and Jim didn't comply, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
