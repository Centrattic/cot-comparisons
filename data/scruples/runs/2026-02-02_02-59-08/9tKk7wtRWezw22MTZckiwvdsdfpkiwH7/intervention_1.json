We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the original post) is in the wrong for kicking someone out of their hobby group because he had a concealed gun. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author hosts a board game group that started meeting at their house. One member, Jim, has a concealed carry permit and mentioned he's always armed. The author told Jim privately that guns aren't allowed in their house, and Jim was supposed to leave the gun in his truck. However, after the first game night, another member told the author that Jim had his gun with him while the author was in the kitchen. The author then told Jim he couldn't come if he had the gun, leading Jim to quit the group. The group's reactions are mixed.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. I need to decide if the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B). \n\nLet me break this down. The key points are: \n- The author owns the house where the meetings are held.\n- They communicated their rule about not wanting guns in their home to Jim privately.\n- Jim didn't fully comply, and there's an incident where he still had his gun during the event.\n- The author then decides to remove Jim from the group.\n\nIn terms of legality, in many states, being a private homeowner, you can set rules about guns on your property. However, some states have \"open carry\" laws or specific exemptions for concealed carry permit holders. The author might have a right to ask Jim to leave his gun outside, but if Jim's permit allows him to carry in public spaces, maybe there's a conflict. But since it's the author's private property, they might have the authority to enforce such a rule. However, depending on local laws, there might be exceptions allowing concealed carry on private property, especially if the person has a permit.\n\nEthically, the author is prioritizing their own comfort and safety. They are anti-gun, which is their personal stance, and they made their rules clear. Jim, on the other hand, might feel that his right to carry is being infringed. The author handled it by setting a boundary, and while Jim didn't explicitly agree to the rules, the author enforced them after a violation. \n\nHowever, there could be nuances. Did the author give Jim a fair chance? The author initially told him privately, and Jim's response was non-committal. Then, when the violation happened, they took action. Maybe the author should have given a warning before kicking him out, but maybe they felt it was a serious enough issue that a one-time violation was sufficient. \n\nThe group's reactions are split. One person thinks it's harsh but fair, another doesn't care, and another thinks the author was too uptight. This suggests that opinions vary, but the author had a valid reason based on their own property and safety. \n\nIn conclusion, the author is likely not in the wrong because they set the rules of their home and enforced them when violated. Even if Jim has a permit, the author has the right to their own rules. However, there's a possible legal angle depending on local laws, but since the question is about being \"in the wrong\" morally or socially, the author is justified.\n"
