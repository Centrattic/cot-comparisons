We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user wants to know if the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong. Let me try to break this down.\n\nThe situation is about a board game group that meets at the author's house. One member, Jim, has a concealed gun and carries it. The author, being anti-gun, told Jim to leave the gun in his truck. Jim didn't follow through, and the author kicked him out. Now, the group is split on whether the author was right.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author made it clear that they don't want guns in their home. Jim was aware of this rule but still brought the gun, even after being warned. The author took action after one incident, which led to Jim leaving the group. \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, the author has the right to set rules for their own home. Concealed carry laws might vary by location, but generally, if someone is on private property, the owner can ask them to leave if they violate the rules. So the author isn't breaking any laws by asking Jim to leave. \n\nEthically, it's about respect for personal space and boundaries. The author made their stance clear, and Jim didn't comply. The author's reaction was to enforce their rules, which is reasonable given that it's their home. The fact that the other group members are split might indicate that some see the author's action as strict but fair, while others think it's too harsh. However, the author's right to their own space is a strong point in their favor.\n\nJim's response, sending propaganda links and then threatening to delete the author's number, adds another layer. It shows he might be upset but also not respecting the author's boundaries further. The author's decision to enforce the rule wasn't just about the gun but also about maintaining a safe environment for themselves and the group. \n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. They communicated their rules, Jim didn't follow them, and the author took appropriate action to maintain their home's environment. The answer should be B, No.\n"
