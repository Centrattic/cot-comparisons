We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit-style \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for kicking someone out of their game group because of a concealed gun.\n\nFirst, the situation: the group moved to the author's house. The author told Jim, who has a concealed carry permit, that he must leave his gun in the truck. Jim agreed sort of. Then, during a game night, Jim had his gun on him when the author was out of the room. The author confronted him, leading to Jim leaving the group. The group reactions are mixed. The author's stance is that it's their house, and they set the rules.\n\nSo, the key points here are about personal property rights and mutual agreements. The author made a clear rule before the first event. However, Jim didn't fully comply. The author had to enforce the rule after the fact. The question is whether this enforcement was unjust.\n\nIn terms of legal aspects, Jim is within his rights to carry a concealed gun in public places, but private property rules can vary. Since it's the author's home, they can set their own rules. If Jim agreed to the rule, then violating it is on him. The author's action is within their right to enforce their space's policies. However, the author might be considered \"harsh\" by some because they gave Jim a warning before kicking him out. But others might see it as reasonable to maintain safety in their home.\n\nAnother angle is whether the author overreacted. The other group members are split, which is common in these situations. The author's main point is that it's their house and they don't want guns inside. Since they communicated this clearly, the action is justified. Jim knew the rule and chose not to follow it. The author isn't in the wrong for enforcing their own rules.\n"
