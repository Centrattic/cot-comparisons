We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for kicking someone out of their hobby group because the person had a concealed gun. The author is anti-gun and made it clear that no guns are allowed in their house. They privately told Jim to leave the gun in his truck. However, Jim ended up keeping the gun with him during the event, and the author then excluded him from the group.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In many places, concealed carry is legal, and carrying a gun in public or private property (if permitted) is allowed. However, private property owners can usually set their own rules regarding weapons. Since the author is hosting the game at their home, they have the right to set conditions for entry. So legally, they might be within their rights to ask Jim to leave his gun in the truck, and if he refuses, they can deny him entry. But if Jim actually entered the house with the gun, the author could enforce their rule by asking him to leave.\n\nThen there's the social side. The author mentions being anti-gun, which is a personal belief. But they had communicated the rule in advance. Jim either misunderstood or didn't comply, which led to the author's response. The author's argument is that it's their house and they set the rules. However, some might argue that someone's personal space shouldn't infringe on another's rights, but since Jim was a guest, the host's rules should be respected.\n\nThe issue here is whether the author's rule is reasonable. Some might think it's a legitimate safety concern, especially if the author is uncomfortable. Others might see it as overly restrictive, especially if Jim had a permit and wasn't a threat. The division in the group's reactions shows different perspectives.\n\nThe author did give a warning first, which is important. Jim didn't follow the rule, so the author enforced it. The main question is whether the author overstepped by kicking Jim out entirely instead of maybe reprimanding him once. But considering it's their home and they had a clear rule, it's within their right to enforce it. The ongoing texts from Jim might be more about his reaction than the author's initial action.\n\nIn conclusion, the author is likely not in the wrong because they set clear boundaries for their home and enforced them after a breach. Jim's actions violated the agreed-upon rule, so the author's response was within their rights as a property owner.\n"
