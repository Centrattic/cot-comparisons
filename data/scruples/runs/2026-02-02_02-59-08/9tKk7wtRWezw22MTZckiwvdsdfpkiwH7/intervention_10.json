We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for kicking someone out of their hobby group because the person was carrying a concealed gun. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author hosts a board game group that meets at their house. One member, Jim, has a concealed carry permit and mentioned he's always armed. The author told Jim that he can't have guns in the house, asking him to leave it in his truck. Jim didn't confirm but later, during a game night, someone else told the author that Jim had his gun while they were out of the room. The author then told Jim he couldn't come anymore, leading Jim to quit. The group's reactions are mixed, and Jim is now sending conflicting messages.\n\nThe author's point is that it's their house and their rules. The question is whether the author overstepped. \n\nI need to consider legal and personal boundaries. In the US, as a homeowner, you can set rules for your property regarding weapons. Many states have laws about carrying guns in private homes, but if the author made it clear that guns are not allowed, and Jim respected that, then the author has the right to enforce that rule. \n\nHowever, there might be nuances. If Jim has a concealed carry permit, he might have a legal right to carry in public, but private property is different. The author's home is their domain, so they can choose not to allow guns. \n\nThe author acted when they found out Jim had the gun during a game night. Since they had already communicated the rule, and Jim didn't follow it, the author's response was to remove him. That seems reasonable from a personal safety and comfort standpoint. \n\nBut some might argue that the author was too quick to act after one incident. However, given that it's about safety, and the author felt violated, enforcing the rule immediately isn't unreasonable. The fact that Jim didn't comply with the initial instruction (leaving the gun in his truck) is the core issue. \n\nAlso, Jim's reaction of sending propaganda might be seen as antagonistic, but that's part of his response to being asked to leave. The author's stance is about their own home, so I think they're justified. Hence, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
