We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for kicking Jim out of their hobby group because he had a concealed gun. The author is anti-gun and made it clear that no guns should be in their house. Jim didn't fully comply, and the author then banned him. The group's reactions are mixed, and the author is getting pushback from some.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points. The author's house, so they can set rules. But Jim had a concealed carry permit, which is legal in many places. The author asked him to leave the gun in his truck, which Jim didn't do. The author then kicked him out after the first incident. The question is whether that was wrong.\n\nOn one hand, the author is in their own home, so they have the right to establish boundaries. If they're uncomfortable with guns, that's their right. Setting a rule about no guns in the house makes sense for their comfort and safety. Jim violated that rule, so the author might be justified in enforcing it.\n\nOn the other hand, Jim had a concealed carry permit, so he's legally allowed to carry. Maybe the author overreacted to a legal situation. Also, the author says they're anti-gun, which might mean they have a bias, but that doesn't necessarily make their rule wrong. However, some might argue that it's discriminatory to exclude someone based on a legal activity.\n\nThe key factors are: the author's right to their home, the legal aspect of concealed carry, and whether the rule is reasonable. If the author made the rule clear before the gathering and Jim didn't follow it, then the author is within their rights to enforce it. But if the rule was a surprise or not clearly communicated, maybe not. In this case, the author did mention it to Jim beforehand, so he should have known. The fact that Jim didn't comply could be seen as him not respecting the host's rules. \n\nThe other group members are split. Some think it's fair, others think it's harsh. The author's reasoning is about safety and personal comfort, which are valid. But maybe some see it as overstepping, especially if the group is supposed to be inclusive. However, the author's perspective is about their own space. \n\nIn terms of legal vs. personal rights, the author isn't breaking any laws by asking someone not to carry in their home. The concealed carry is legal for Jim, but the host can set their own rules. So the author's action is about their own space and comfort, which is a personal right. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong; they enforced their own rules. So the answer would be B, No.\n"
