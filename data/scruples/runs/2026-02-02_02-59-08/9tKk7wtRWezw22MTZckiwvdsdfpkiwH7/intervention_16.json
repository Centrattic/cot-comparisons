We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong for kicking someone out of their hobby group because he was carrying a concealed gun. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author is the host of the game group. They moved the meetings to their home, which is a personal space. The author is anti-gun, which is their personal right. Jim, a member, has a concealed carry permit and mentions he's always armed. The author told Jim privately before the first home meeting that guns aren't allowed in their house. Jim's response was non-committal. Then, after the first session, another member told the author that Jim had his gun on him when the author was out of the room. The author then texted Jim, saying this was disrespectful and that he couldn't come if he had a gun. Jim quit the group. The rest of the group is split on the author's decision.\n\nThe author's perspective is that it's their house and their rules. They considered this a serious matter, not something trivial like snacks. Jim is now texting back and forth with the author, trying to get his number removed and sending links to support his side.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Let's consider the legal and social aspects. Legally, in the US, the host can set rules for their home. They can ask someone to leave if they violate those rules. Jim had been told beforehand, and the author felt he violated the agreement. The author's action was based on their comfort and safety. Legally, the author has the right to deny someone entry to their home if they break the rules.\n\nSocially, some might argue that the author is being overly strict, especially since Jim had a permit. But others might support the author's right to enforce their personal boundaries. The key point is that it's the author's house, and they have the authority to set the rules. Even if Jim had a permit, the author can choose not to allow guns on their property. The author's action was a firm but reasonable enforcement of their rule, which is their right as the host.\n\nThe other members' reactions are mixed, but that's expected. The author's decision isn't about being a \"shrew\" but about personal safety and comfort. The author didn't kick Jim out publicly but communicated privately first. When Jim violated the rule, the author followed through. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
