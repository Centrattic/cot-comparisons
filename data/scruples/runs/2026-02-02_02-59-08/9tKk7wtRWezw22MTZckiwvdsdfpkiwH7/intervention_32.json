We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit-style question is in the wrong for kicking someone out of their hobby group because the person was carrying a concealed gun. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author hosts board game nights at their home. One member, Jim, has a concealed carry permit and mentioned he always carries a gun. The author initially told Jim to leave the gun in his truck. Jim didn't fully confirm he'd comply. Later, another member told the author that Jim had the gun with him during a session when the author was away. The author then told Jim he couldn't come to the house if he was armed, leading to Jim quitting.\n\nThe author's stance is that it's their house and they set the rules. They don't want guns in their home. The other group members are split on the reaction. The user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nSo, considering the legal aspect, in the US, as a private homeowner, the author can set rules about guns on their property. Many states allow concealed carry, but private property owners can prohibit guns. So legally, the author is within their rights to ask Jim to leave the gun outside.\n\nEthically and socially, it's more nuanced. The author's comfort and safety in their own home is a valid concern. They made their rules clear beforehand, and Jim didn't fully adhere. The author followed through on their statement, which is consistent. However, some might argue that the action was harsh, especially if Jim had a permit and others in the group weren't as concerned. But the author isn't obligated to tolerate behavior that makes them uncomfortable in their own space.\n\nThe response from the other member indicates that Jim didn't follow the initial rule, so the author's decision to remove him isn't without cause. The author isn't wrong for enforcing their boundaries, even if it's a personal choice. The other group's mixed reactions show differing opinions, but the author isn't in the wrong for making a personal choice about their property.\n"
