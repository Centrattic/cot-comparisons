We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a board game group where one member, Jim, has a concealed gun. The author, who hosts the game nights at their home, told Jim he can't bring the gun into the house. Jim didn't exactly confirm he would follow that, and later someone else told the author that Jim was still carrying the gun when the author was out of the room. The author then kicked Jim out of the group, leading to some reactions from the other members.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. Concealed carry laws vary by location. If Jim has a valid concealed carry permit, he's allowed to carry the gun in public places. However, in a private residence, the owner can set their own rules. So if the author doesn't want guns in their house, they can legally enforce that. Jim was told beforehand, but he didn't comply, which led the author to take action. \n\nFrom a personal safety standpoint, the author has the right to feel unsafe around guns. They made their boundaries clear, and when those were violated, they took a stand. That seems reasonable. However, some might argue that the author overreacted by immediately removing Jim after one incident. But since it's the author's home, setting a firm boundary makes sense.\n\nThe other group members have mixed reactions. One person is indifferent, another thinks it was harsh but fair, and one person disagrees. The key here is that the author's house is the venue, so their rules take precedence. Even if Jim had carried a gun before in a public space, the author has the right to change the location to a private home where their rules apply.\n\nAlso, Jim's response after being told seems dismissive. He didn't confirm he would leave the gun in his truck, and then when confronted, he just said \"Fine\" and left. That suggests he wasn't willing to respect the author's rule. The author had to make a choice between allowing a violation of their home policy or removing the person. \n\nIn terms of social dynamics, the author is within their right to enforce their personal space rules. While some might see it as being \"uptight,\" the author's decision is about personal safety and comfort. The fact that the group split in their opinions shows that different people have different views on the matter, but legally and ethically, the owner of the home has the final say.\n\nSo putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. They set clear boundaries, communicated them, and when those were broken, they took appropriate action to maintain their home's safety. The answer should be B.\n"
