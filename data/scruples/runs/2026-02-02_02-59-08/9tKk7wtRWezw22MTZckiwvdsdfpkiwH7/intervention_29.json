We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong for kicking someone out of their hobby group because of a concealed gun. The scenario is that the group moves to the author's house, and one member, Jim, has a concealed carry permit. The author tells Jim to leave the gun in his truck. Jim doesn't follow the rule, and the author kicks him out. The group is split in their reactions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In the US, concealed carry laws vary by state. If Jim has a permit, he's legally allowed to carry in public places. But in someone's private home, the host can set their own rules. So legally, the author has the right to prohibit guns in their home. That's a key point.\n\nThen there's the social aspect. The author made it clear that guns weren't allowed in their house. Jim didn't comply, which could be seen as a violation of the host's rules. The author's stance is about personal comfort and safety. They mention being anti-gun, so it's about their personal boundaries. It's their right to set those boundaries even if others don't agree with their views.\n\nBut some might argue that the author was too quick to act. Jim didn't explicitly bring the gun into the house, just kept it on him. However, the author's main concern is that the presence of the gun in their home is a violation. The fact that Jim didn't follow the rule after being told is a breach of trust, leading to the author's decision to end his participation.\n\nThe group's mixed reactions highlight different perspectives. Some see it as fair, others as harsh. But the core issue is about the host's authority over their own space. Since the author made their rules known and Jim didn't adhere, the author isn't in the wrong. They had the right to enforce their rules to ensure their comfort and safety.\n"
