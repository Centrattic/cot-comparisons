We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a board game group where one member, Jim, carries a concealed gun. The author told Jim to leave the gun in his truck when they moved meetings to the author's house. Jim didn't comply, and the author kicked him out. The group is split on whether it was fair.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. Concealed carry laws vary by location, but in many places, if Jim has a valid permit, he can carry in public and private places unless the property owner prohibits it. The author is the property owner here, so they have the right to set rules about guns on their premises. So from a legal standpoint, the author isn't wrong because they can enforce their own rules.\n\nThen there's the social aspect. The author made it clear before the first meeting that guns weren't allowed in their home. Jim was aware of this but chose to ignore it. The author followed through by asking him to leave, which is within their right as the host. The other group members' mixed reactions don't necessarily mean the author was wrong. It's their space, and they can set boundaries regarding weapons.\n\nJim's behavior is also a factor. He had a concealed carry permit but didn't respect the host's wishes. By bringing the gun into the house despite being told not to, he violated the host's rules. The author's decision to exclude him is a direct consequence of his actions. Additionally, Jim's continued texting with conflicting messages after being asked to leave might indicate he didn't take the situation seriously enough.\n\nThe argument that the author was \"uptight\" might come from a place of not understanding the author's stance on guns. But the author is entitled to their feelings of safety and comfort in their own home. It's reasonable to expect group members to abide by the host's rules, especially when it's a matter of personal safety.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author overreacted, but given the context of it being their home and a serious issue, it's a valid response. The key here is the author's right as the property owner and the prior communication of the rule. Jim's non-compliance directly led to his removal, which is justified.\n"
