We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for kicking someone out of their hobby group because he carried a concealed gun. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author hosts a board game group at their house. Jim, a member, has a concealed carry permit and mentioned he always carries a gun. The author told Jim upfront that they don't want guns in their house and asked him to leave it in his truck. Jim responded ambiguously. Later, the author found out Jim still had his gun during a game night when they were in the kitchen. The author then told Jim he couldn't come if he had a gun, leading to Jim quitting. The group is split on whether the author was right.\n\nSo, the key points here are the author's right to set rules in their own home versus Jim's right to carry a concealed weapon. The author made it clear they didn't want guns in their house. Jim, despite being told, still brought the gun. The author followed up after discovering this and enforced their rule. \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, in the US, a private homeowner can set rules about firearms in their property. So the author is within their rights to ask Jim not to have guns in their home. The issue is whether the author was wrong in enforcing that rule. The author's reasoning is that it's their house and they don't want guns there. They took action after one incident, which some might see as strict, but others would support as necessary for safety. \n\nThe group's reaction is mixed. One person doesn't care, another thinks it's harsh but fair, and another thinks the author was too uptight. The author's perspective is valid because they have control over their own space. Even if Jim has a permit, the author can choose not to allow guns in their home. \n\nHowever, maybe some might argue that the author was overreacting because Jim didn't have a history of issues, but the author had a clear anti-gun stance. The situation is about personal boundaries. The author made their rules clear, and when violated, they enforced them. That seems reasonable. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is probably B (No, the author isn't in the wrong). They have the right to set boundaries in their home, and enforcing that rule after a breach is justified. The fact that Jim continued to carry the gun despite being asked not to might make the author's decision more understandable. The other group members' reactions don't necessarily indicate the author is wrong. It's about personal choice and safety.\n"
