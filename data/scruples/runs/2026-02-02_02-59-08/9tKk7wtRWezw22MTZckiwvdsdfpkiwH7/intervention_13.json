We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about someone kicking another person out of a hobby group because he was carrying a concealed gun. The author is anti-gun but didn't mention it before. They told Jim privately that guns aren't allowed in their house. Jim didn't confirm, and then later, another group member found out Jim still had his gun when the author was in the kitchen. The author then told Jim to leave the group if he wanted to keep his gun. Jim quit, and there's mixed reactions in the group.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In many places, concealed carry laws allow individuals to carry guns in private homes unless the homeowner explicitly prohibits it. So if the author told Jim not to bring the gun into their house, and Jim did so anyway, he might have violated the homeowner's rules. But does that justify being kicked out of a social group?\n\nNext, the author's perspective is that it's their house and their rules. They might feel entitled to set boundaries. However, some might argue that asking someone to leave a group because of a legal activity could be seen as overreacting. But others might side with the author, emphasizing personal safety and comfort.\n\nThe author didn't ask Jim to leave immediately when he first brought the gun, but after being informed, they took action. The key point is whether the author's reaction was proportionate. Since the author made their stance clear beforehand and Jim disregarded it, the author's decision could be seen as enforcing their own rules. However, the group is small, and the author decided the terms of hosting, so it's their right to set the conditions for their home.\n\nOn the other hand, if the author is anti-gun, maybe they should have addressed it earlier or found a compromise. But since they did communicate their rules and Jim didn't comply, the author's action is justified. The mixed reactions in the group suggest that it's a nuanced situation, but the author's main point is about their own home's safety.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong because they have the right to set rules in their home, and Jim violated those rules. The answer would be B.\n"
