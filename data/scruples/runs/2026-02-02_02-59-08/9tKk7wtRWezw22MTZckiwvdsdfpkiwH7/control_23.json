We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for kicking someone out of their hobby group because of a concealed gun. \n\nFirst, the situation: the author hosts game nights at their house, and Jim, a member with a concealed carry permit, brings his gun. The author told Jim privately that he needs to leave the gun in his truck. Jim didn't clearly agree, but then during the first session at the house, Jim had the gun with him when the author was away. The author kicked him out, and now others in the group are divided.\n\nSo, the main issue is about personal boundaries and safety. The author made it clear that guns aren't allowed in their home. Jim, despite being informed, didn't comply. The author then took action, which some see as harsh but fair, others as being a shrew.\n\nLegally, the author owns their home and can set rules. Even if Jim has a permit, if the author doesn't allow guns in their house, Jim must comply. If he didn't follow the rule, the author has the right to remove him. The author's point about it being their house seems valid. The fact that Jim continued to bring the gun after being told might show disrespect, hence the author's decision to remove him. The others' reactions are mixed, but the author's actions were based on their own comfort and safety. So the author isn't necessarily in the wrong here. The answer is B.\n"
