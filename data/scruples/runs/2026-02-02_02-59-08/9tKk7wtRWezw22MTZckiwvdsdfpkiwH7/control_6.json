We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. So the question is whether the author (the person who wrote the post) is in the wrong for kicking Jim out of their hobby group because he had a concealed gun. \n\nFirst, the situation: They have a board game group that moved to the author's house. Jim has a concealed carry permit and mentioned he always carries a gun. The author told him privately before the first meeting at their house that no guns are allowed. Jim responded in a way that wasn't a clear agreement. Then during the meeting, Jim had the gun on him when the author was in the kitchen. The author then told Jim he couldn't come back if he had a gun, leading to Jim quitting the group. \n\nThe author's main argument is that it's their house and they have the right to set rules. They didn't want guns in their home, so they enforced that. The reactions from the group are mixed. Some think it's fair, some think it's harsh. \n\nNow, considering the laws around concealed carry. In many places, if you have a permit, you can carry in private property unless the owner prohibits it. So the author can set the rule that no guns are allowed on their property. So Jim, having a permit, could be allowed to carry, but the author's house is private, so the author can enforce no guns. Therefore, Jim wasn't allowed to have the gun in the house, and the author is within their rights to ask him to leave it in his car or not allow him in if he brings it.\n\nBut the author had already told Jim before the event that they needed to leave the gun in the truck. Jim didn't comply, which is a violation of the agreed-upon rule. The author then followed through by asking him to leave the group if he couldn't follow the rules. \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, the author has the right to set such rules for their home. The issue is more about personal comfort and safety. The author is anti-gun, which is a personal belief, but they are asserting their right to have a gun-free environment in their home. Even if the group is social, the host can set boundaries. \n\nJim's actions (bringing the gun despite being explicitly told not to) could be seen as a breach of trust or respect. The author felt disrespected because Jim didn't follow the rule even after being warned. The author's decision to remove him from the group is a consequence for breaking that rule, which is within their right as the host. \n\nThe other group members' mixed reactions don't necessarily mean the author is wrong. The author's decision is based on their own comfort and safety in their home. It's a personal choice, and unless there's a law that prohibits someone from asking guests to leave based on having a gun (which I don't think exists), the author isn't in the wrong. \n\nSo, the answer should be B, No, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
