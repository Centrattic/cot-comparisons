We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again to make sure I understand all the details.\n\nThe author is part of a board game group that's been meeting for six months. They used to meet at a hobby shop but now meet at the author's house. There are five people in the group, including Jim, who has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun. The author is anti-gun but hadn't mentioned it before. Before the first game night at their house, the author told Jim privately that no guns are allowed and he should leave his in his truck. Jim responded in a way that wasn't very affirming. Then, during the first game night, while the author was in the kitchen, Jim told another group member that he still had his gun with him. The author confronted him via text, leading to Jim leaving the group. The reactions from others are split, with some supporting the author's decision and others thinking it was too harsh.\n\nThe author's main point is that it's their house and their rules, so they have the right to set boundaries. They didn't want a gun in their home and acted on it the first time it happened. Jim, on the other hand, is now sending mixed messages and propaganda.\n\nSo, the key questions here are: Does the author have the right to enforce their house rules? Is it reasonable to ask someone to leave their gun outside, even if they have a permit? Was the author's response appropriate given the situation?\n\nFirst, legal rights. In the U.S., gun laws vary by state, but generally, a homeowner can set rules about guns on their property. Even if someone has a concealed carry permit, the homeowner can ask them not to bring a gun into their home. So from a legal standpoint, the author is within their rights.\n\nSecond, social dynamics. The author made their stance clear beforehand. Jim either misunderstood or intentionally ignored the rule. The author then followed up when they found out about the breach. Since it was a first-time violation of a clear rule, the author chose to exclude Jim. The group's mixed reactions might stem from different personal views on guns, but the author's action was a direct response to a rule being broken in their own home.\n\nThird, the author's reasoning. They emphasized that it's a serious matter, not a trivial one like snacks. The author's concern for safety in their own home is valid. Even if Jim has carried a gun in other places before, the author's home is a private space where they can enforce their own policies.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the author could have handled it differently, like giving Jim a second chance or discussing it in person. But given that the author made their rules clear upfront and the breach occurred despite that, it's understandable that they took a firm stance. The fact that Jim continued to send mixed messages after being told adds to the justification.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong because they're enforcing their own rules in their home, which is their right. The response was appropriate given the circumstances, and the division in the group is more about differing personal views on guns rather than the author's actions being unjustified.\n"
