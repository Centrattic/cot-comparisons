We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the situation provided is in the wrong. The scenario involves a board game group where the author kicks someone out for carrying a concealed gun to their house. The author is anti-gun but had previously allowed the person to attend meetings at a shop. When they switched to the author's home, they explicitly told the guy, Jim, to leave his gun in his truck. Jim didn't comply, and the author kicked him out. The group's reactions are mixed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the user's perspective. They think the author is in the wrong but want to know if I agree. The main points here are the author's right to set rules in their home versus Jim's right to carry a gun under a concealed permit. \n\nThe author made a rule before the event, so they had a heads-up. Jim either misunderstood or didn't take the rule seriously. The author followed through when the rule was broken, which is about respecting boundaries. However, some might argue that carrying a gun is a legal right, and the author overreacted. But since it's the author's home, they can set their own policies, even if it's a hobby group. \n\nThe user mentioned that the author is anti-gun, which adds context. The author's stance is clear, and they took action the first time the rule was broken. Others in the group have mixed feelings, but the key here is ownership of the space. Legally, the author has the right to ask someone not to bring a weapon into their home. So, from a rights perspective, the author isn't in the wrong. \n\nHowever, maybe there's a social aspect. Some might say that the author could have been more accommodating or that one instance isn't enough. But the author made their stance clear beforehand. Jim's behavior of texting back with propaganda might show a lack of respect, which could justify the author's firm action. \n\nSo, putting it all together: the author set a rule in their home, Jim broke it despite being warned, and the author enforced it. The author's actions are within their rights, so they're not in the wrong. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
