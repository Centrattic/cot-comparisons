We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the Reddit-style post is in the wrong for kicking someone out of their hobby group because he was carrying a concealed gun. The author is anti-gun, and they made it clear before the event that guns weren't allowed in their home. Jim, who has a concealed carry permit, had the gun on him during the event despite being told to leave it in his truck. The author then banned him from future meetings.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. Concealed carry laws vary by state, but generally, if someone has a valid permit, they can carry a concealed weapon in most public places. However, private property owners have the right to prohibit guns on their land. So the author, as the homeowner, has the legal right to set that rule.\n\nNext, the ethics. The author made their stance clear beforehand, so Jim should have known the rules. If he brought the gun despite being warned, he violated the host's terms. The author has the right to enforce their rules, especially for safety concerns. Even if Jim felt it was his right to carry, the host's comfort and safety take precedence in their own home.\n\nThe group's reactions are mixed, but the author's action was about personal boundaries. The argument that it's \"just one session\" might not hold because the author chose to address it immediately, showing seriousness about the rule. Jim's continued texts after being asked to leave might indicate he wasn't respecting the boundary, which justifies the author's decision.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. They set clear rules on their property, and Jim broke them. The author has every right to enforce their safety preferences. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
