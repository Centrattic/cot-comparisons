We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this scenario is in the wrong for kicking Jim out of their hobby group over his concealed gun. So, the author is in the US, obviously, since it's about concealed carry permits.\n\nFirst, legally, in the US, carrying a concealed gun is legal in many states with a permit. So, Jim has a right to carry his gun. But the author is in their own home, so they can set rules about what's allowed there. The author told Jim beforehand that no guns in the house, and Jim was supposed to leave it in his truck. But Jim ended up keeping it with him during the gathering. \n\nThe author then kicked him out after the first meeting. Now, the author's argument is that it's their house, their rules. But some people might argue that Jim had a concealed carry permit, so he's allowed to have the gun on his person. The author could have allowed him to keep it in his truck, which is legal. But Jim's actions might have disregarded the author's request. \n\nBut wait, the author said he had to leave it in his truck. So if Jim had the gun on him, he violated the agreed-upon rule. The author's right to control their own property is a strong point. However, there's also the aspect of someone's legal right to carry a gun. However, when you're invited into someone's home, the host can set terms. So even if Jim has a permit, if the host says no guns in the house, he might have to comply unless there's an exception.\n\nBut maybe there's a misunderstanding. Some people might think that having a permit allows them to carry the gun wherever they go, but in reality, private property owners can set their own rules. So the author isn't violating any laws by setting that rule. The author's action was based on respecting their own space and safety. The other group members have mixed reactions, but the author's stance is about personal boundaries.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. It's their house, and they made their expectations clear. Jim didn't follow them, so the author enforced the rule. Therefore, answer B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
