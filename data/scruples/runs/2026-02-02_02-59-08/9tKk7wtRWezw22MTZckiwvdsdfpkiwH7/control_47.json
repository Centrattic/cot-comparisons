We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for kicking someone out of their hobby group because he was carrying a concealed gun. \n\nFirst, the author made it clear before the first meeting at their house that no guns were allowed and that Jim needed to leave his in his truck. Jim acknowledged this but then, during the event, still had his gun with him. The author found out through another member and then sent a message to Jim, leading him to quit.\n\nSo, the main points here are about consent and safety. The author owns the property where the meetings are now held, so they have the right to set rules for their home. Jim was aware of the rule but didn't comply, which could be seen as a breach of trust. The author then took action to enforce their rule, which is reasonable because safety in one's own home is a valid concern.\n\nSome people might think that the author overreacted, especially if Jim didn't have issues before. But the author's stance is about their personal space and safety. It's their house, so they can decide who can and can't be there. The fact that Jim continued to carry the gun despite being told not to is a big deal. The author didn't want to risk any potential danger, so removing him makes sense.\n\nThe other group members' mixed reactions don't change the fact that the author's decision is about their own comfort and safety. Even if some think it's harsh, the author isn't obligated to host people under conditions they're uncomfortable with. Jim's actions violated the agreed-upon rule, so the author's response is justified.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
