We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong for kicking someone out of their hobby group because of a concealed gun. The options are A or B.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The author hosts a board game group at their home. One member, Jim, has a concealed carry permit and mentioned he always carries a gun. The author told Jim privately that guns aren't allowed in their house, and Jim was supposed to leave it in his truck. But during the first game night, Jim still had the gun on him when the author was away. The author kicked him out, and there's some mixed reactions from the group.\n\nNow, I need to determine if the author was in the wrong. The key points here are about personal property rights versus the host's rules. Since it's the author's house, they have the right to set their own rules regarding weapons. In many places, as a host, you can establish a gun-free environment, and guests are expected to comply. Jim didn't follow the rule, so the author has the right to remove him, especially for their own safety and comfort.\n\nThe other group's mixed reactions don't matter here. The main issue is the host's authority over their own home. Even if Jim has a permit, he should respect the host's wishes. The author made it clear beforehand, so Jim's continued presence with a gun was a violation. The author isn't obligated to tolerate that, especially since it's a recurring issue. The communication from the author was direct, and after a breach, the action was taken. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
