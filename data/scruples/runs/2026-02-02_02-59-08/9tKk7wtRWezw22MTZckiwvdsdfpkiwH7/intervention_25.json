We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a board game group where one member, Jim, has a concealed carry permit and brings his gun to a house gathering. The author asked him to leave the gun in the truck, but Jim brought it anyway. The author then kicked him out of the group.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In the US, concealed carry laws vary by state, but generally, if Jim has a valid permit, he's allowed to carry in public places. However, private property is different. The author's home is private, and they can set their own rules. So legally, the author isn't violating any laws by asking Jim to not bring a gun into the house. Jim might have been within his rights to carry in public, but once you get to private property, the property owner can set conditions. So the author isn't in the wrong legally.\n\nNext, the social dynamics. The author made it clear before the first meeting that guns weren't allowed in the house. Jim either didn't comply or didn't confirm he would comply. The issue is whether the author overreacted by immediately kicking Jim out after one incident. The author's reasoning is about safety and personal comfort. They feel that having a gun in the house is a serious issue, not a minor infraction like bringing the wrong snacks. So they took a firm stance. \n\nJim's perspective might be that he's legally allowed to carry and that he's not violating any laws. However, the author's home is a private space, and Jim's continued presence after being asked to leave his gun in the truck could be a violation of the agreed-upon rules. \n\nThe reactions from the group are mixed. Some think it's fair, others think it's too harsh. The key here is whether the author's action was reasonable given the circumstances. Since it was the first time and the author addressed it immediately, it's a matter of personal boundaries. The author is within their rights to enforce rules in their home, so they aren't in the wrong. Jim chose to leave when told, so the conflict was resolved. The author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
