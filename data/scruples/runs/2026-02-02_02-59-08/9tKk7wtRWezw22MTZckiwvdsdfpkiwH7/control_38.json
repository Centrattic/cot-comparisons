We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for kicking someone out of their hobby group because he was carrying a concealed gun. The scenario is that the author is anti-gun and made it clear that there can't be guns in their house. Jim, who has a concealed carry permit, didn't comply and was asked to leave. The group's reactions are mixed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. If Jim has a concealed carry permit, he's allowed to carry a gun in public places, but private property rules might override that. The author's house is private, so they can set their own rules. Legally, the author isn't violating any laws by asking him to leave if he doesn't comply with their rules.\n\nNext, the social aspect. The author mentioned they made it clear before the first meeting that guns weren't allowed. Jim didn't follow through, leading the author to take action. The author's stance is about personal safety and comfort in their own home, which is a valid concern. Even if Jim had a permit, the author has the right to enforce their house rules.\n\nThe reactions from the group are split, but that's normal. Some might see it as reasonable, others as overreacting. However, the key point is that the author is the host and has the authority to set boundaries. The fact that Jim continued to carry the gun despite being asked not to is a breach of the agreed-upon rules, justifying the author's decision.\n\nJim's response of quitting might seem like an overreaction, but he's within his rights to leave if he disagrees with the rules. The author isn't obligated to keep him in the group against their will. The ongoing texts from Jim show he's still engaged, but that's his choice.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong because they have the right to enforce their house rules for safety. Jim's non-compliance led to his removal, which is justified.\n"
