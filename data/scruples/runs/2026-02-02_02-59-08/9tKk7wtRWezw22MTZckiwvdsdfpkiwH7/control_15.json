We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for kicking someone out of their hobby group because of a concealed gun. So first, I need to understand the situation.\n\nThe author hosts a board game group at their house now, instead of a shop. One member, Jim, has a concealed carry permit and mentioned he's always armed. The author told Jim privately not to bring the gun into the house, but Jim still had it with him during the first game night. The author found out from another member and then told Jim he couldn't come if he had the gun. Jim left, and the group's reactions are mixed.\n\nThe author's perspective is that it's their house, their rules. They don't want guns there. Jim kept texting after, which is making the author frustrated. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nSo, I need to consider a few points. First, the right to set rules in one's home. Generally, a homeowner can set rules for their property, including not allowing guns if they're uncomfortable. However, there might be laws about concealed carry. Depending on the jurisdiction, the author might have a right to ask Jim to leave the gun in his truck, but if Jim is legally allowed to carry, the author can't prohibit it. However, in some places, private property owners can prohibit guns, even if someone has a permit. So the legal aspect might be a factor here.\n\nThen there's the social aspect. The author felt disrespected when Jim didn't follow the rule. The group is a close-knit one, and the author felt it was important to establish boundaries. On the other hand, Jim might have felt that his rights were being infringed upon, especially if he's legally allowed to carry in that state. The split reactions in the group suggest that some see the author's actions as reasonable, others as harsh.\n\nAnother angle is communication. The author did talk to Jim privately before the event, but maybe the message wasn't clear enough? Jim might have thought he could still carry for protection, not realizing the author was serious. However, the author followed up after the incident, making it clear that it was a deal-breaker. Jim's response was to leave, which might indicate he understood the seriousness.\n\nThe author's motivation is about feeling safe in their own home. That's a valid concern. The fact that Jim continued carrying despite being asked could be seen as a breach of trust. The author isn't banning Jim for something trivial, like snacks, but for a serious issue that affects their comfort and safety.\n\nBut some might argue that the author overreacted, especially if Jim had a concealed carry permit and was acting within legal boundaries. The author's decision could be seen as infringing on Jim's rights if the law allows him to carry in private homes. However, in some states, private property owners can prohibit guns even with a permit. So it depends on local laws.\n\nIn terms of the hobby group, the author is the host, so their rules should be respected. If others in the group are okay with it, even if they don't agree with the author's stance, they see it as fair. The fact that one person thinks the author is being a shrew suggests that there's room for debate, but the majority of the group might support the decision.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The author is within their rights to set rules for their home, especially regarding safety concerns. They communicated the rule beforehand, Jim didn't comply, and the author took action. The author isn't in the wrong because they're protecting their own space and boundaries. Answer B.\n"
