We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. Let me start by breaking down the key points.\n\nThe author runs a board game group and has moved meetings to their home. One member, Jim, has a concealed carry permit and mentions he's always armed. The author privately told Jim that he couldn't have the gun in the house, and Jim acknowledged but maybe didn't fully agree. Then, after the first meeting at the author's house, another member says Jim had the gun on him when the author was in the kitchen. The author then tells Jim he can't come anymore if he's armed, leading to Jim leaving. The reactions from the group are mixed, with some agreeing and some disagreeing. The author is now being criticized by one member for being too uptight, and Jim is sending conflicting messages.\n\nThe author's stance is that it's their house and their rules, and they didn't want a gun there. They set the rule before the first meeting. Jim didn't follow it, so the author removed him. The question is if the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the author's right to set rules in their own home is a strong point. They have the authority to decide who can come into their house and under what conditions. Jim was aware of the rule, but he broke it. The author gave a clear warning, and when the rule was violated, they took action. \n\nBut maybe there's nuance. Jim has a concealed carry permit, which in many places allows him to carry a gun unless prohibited. If the author's home is not a prohibited location, then maybe Jim isn't breaking the law. However, private property owners can set their own rules regardless of public law. The author can ask someone to leave if they don't follow their rules. \n\nThe author could have handled it differently, like having a more formal discussion or asking the others to help enforce the rule. But the fact that they directly addressed Jim and then followed up when the rule was broken seems reasonable. \n\nThe criticism from one group member might be valid if they think it's an overreaction, but the author's comfort and safety in their own home is a personal choice. Guns can be a sensitive issue, and the author's stance isn't unreasonable given their anti-gun views. \n\nJim's response of not following the rule might have been a risk, but he knew the rule ahead of time. The author isn't obligated to let someone into their home if they have a policy they've communicated. \n\nSo considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. They set clear rules, communicated them, and enforced them when violated. The fact that the group is split but others support the decision suggests that the author's actions were within their rights.\n"
