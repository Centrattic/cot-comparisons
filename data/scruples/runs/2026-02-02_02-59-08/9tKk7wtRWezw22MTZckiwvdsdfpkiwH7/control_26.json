We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the \"AITA\" story is in the wrong for kicking someone out of their hobby group because he had a concealed gun. The question is whether they did something wrong by enforcing their rule about guns in their home. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author hosts a board game group and invited people to their house. One member, Jim, has a concealed carry permit and usually carries a gun. The author told Jim upfront that there's no guns allowed in the house, so he should leave it in his truck. Jim agreed somewhat, but then during the first game night, he kept the gun with him when the author was out of the room. The author found out through another group member and then confronted Jim, leading to him leaving the group. The group reactions are mixed.\n\nThe author's perspective is that it's their house and they set the rules. They consider this a serious issue, not a minor thing like snacks. Jim is sending mixed messages now through texts. The question is whether the author's actions were wrong.\n\nI need to consider the legality and social norms. In the US, concealed carry is legal in many states, and you can't be denied entry to public places unless the location is a prohibited area (like a school). However, private property owners have the right to set rules for their homes. The author is using their right to control their own home by not allowing guns. So legally, the author is in their rights.\n\nSocially, it's more about personal boundaries. The author is anti-gun, which is a personal belief. They communicated the rule beforehand, and Jim should have respected that. Even if Jim thought it was okay to have his gun on him, the author's request was clear. If he couldn't comply, he shouldn't attend. The author isn't being unreasonable here because they made the rule explicit before the event. Jim's actions broke the agreed-upon rule, so the author's response of asking him to leave is justified.\n\nThe group's mixed reactions don't change the fact that the author's decision was based on their own rules. The other members who think it's harsh might not see the severity, but the author had a clear boundary. It's not about being uptight; it's about enforcing a rule that affects their comfort and safety. The author isn't overreacting to a minor issue but addressing a serious rule violation. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
