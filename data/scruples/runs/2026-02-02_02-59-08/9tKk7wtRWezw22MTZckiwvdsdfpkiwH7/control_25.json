We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for kicking someone out of their hobby group because he had a concealed gun in their home.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The author is hosting game nights at their house. They made it clear before the first meeting that they don't want guns in their home, asking Jim to leave his in his truck. Jim responded in a way that wasn't a clear agreement. Then, after the first session, someone else told the author that Jim had his gun with him when they were out of the room. The author then texted Jim, told him he was being disrespectful, and that he couldn't come if he had a gun. Jim left the group.\n\nThe key points here are: it's the author's house, they set the rules, and their comfort and safety are their own to manage. Jim had a concealed carry permit, but the author never agreed to him having the gun in the house. Jim didn't follow the initial request, which could be seen as a violation of the host's rules. The author took action after the fact, which led to Jim leaving. The other group members have mixed reactions, but the author's stance is about their own space.\n\nIn terms of legalities, concealed carry laws vary by location, but in a private home, the host can typically set rules. Even if Jim had a permit, the author as the host could decide that guns aren't allowed there. The author's action was based on their own comfort and safety, which is a valid reason. They also gave a warning beforehand, so it's not like it was a surprise. Jim didn't comply, so the author took the necessary step to enforce their rule. The author isn't in the wrong because it's their house and they have the right to establish their boundaries. The answer should be B (No).\n"
