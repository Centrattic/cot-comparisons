We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for kicking someone out of their hobby group because he had a concealed gun. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author hosts a board game group that's moved to their house. One member, Jim, has a concealed carry permit and mentions he's always armed. The author tells Jim privately that guns aren't allowed in the house, and Jim seems to acknowledge that. However, during the first session at the author's house, Jim still carries the gun, and another member tells the author about it when they're out of earshot. The author then texts Jim, telling him he's disrespectful and can't come anymore if he's armed. Jim quits, and the group's reactions are mixed.\n\nThe author's main argument is that it's their house and they set the rules. Jim violated a rule they clearly stated. But some might argue that Jim had a concealed carry permit and thought it was necessary for his safety, or maybe he didn't think the author's rule was valid. The author's action was to enforce their personal safety rule, which is within their right as the host. However, the other group members have differing opinions. \n\nNow, considering the laws around concealed carry. In many places, people are allowed to carry in private homes if they have a permit. So maybe the author's rule is in conflict with the law. Wait, but the author can set their own policies. For example, even if someone is legally allowed to carry a gun in their home, the homeowner can refuse entry if the person is armed. So legally, the author might have the right to enforce a gun-free policy on their property. \n\nBut the question is about moral blame, not just legality. Some people might see the author as overreacting, especially if Jim was following the law and didn't have a prior issue. But others, like the author, prioritize personal safety and comfort, and setting that boundary is reasonable. The author did give a heads-up before the event, so Jim had a chance to comply. When he didn't, the author took action. The fact that Jim continued to carry despite being told could be seen as a violation of trust. \n\nThe other group members' reactions are split. One person thinks it's harsh but fair, another doesn't care, and one thinks the author is being too uptight. But the author's perspective is about their own comfort and safety. Since it's their house, they have the right to make such rules. Even if Jim's actions were legal, the author isn't obligated to allow him to bring a gun into their home. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. They enforced their policy and followed through when it was violated. Therefore, the answer should be B, they're not in the wrong.\n"
