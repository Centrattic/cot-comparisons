We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for kicking someone out of their hobby group because he had a concealed gun. The situation is that the author hosts a board game group at their house, and one member, Jim, carries a concealed weapon. The author told Jim upfront that he couldn't have the gun in the house, but then later found out Jim still had it with him. The author then asked Jim not to come back if he was going to have a gun, leading to Jim leaving.\n\nSo, first, the author's perspective: they own their home and have the right to set rules. They were clear about the gun policy, and when Jim violated it, they took action. That seems reasonable because it's their space. The author's stance is about personal safety and comfort, especially since they're anti-gun.\n\nOn the other hand, Jim had a concealed carry permit, which in many places is legal. He might not have realized the author's strong feelings or thought it was an issue. But the author had already communicated the rule, so maybe Jim was in the wrong for not following it. However, the author could have handled it differently, like asking again or giving a warning. But the user's question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nThe group's reactions are mixed. Some find it fair, others think it harsh. But the key point is about the author's right to their home. In most places, the homeowner can set rules about weapons on their property. So if Jim had a permit but the author doesn't want guns there, the author can enforce that. The author didn't make it a condition to participate elsewhere, like the hobby shop, which was in a less safe area. Now that they're at the author's house, the rules change. \n\nBut wait, if the group was meeting at the hobby shop before and Jim carried a gun there, was that an issue? The author didn't mention it before switching to their house. Maybe the author only became aware of Jim's gun when moving the location. But the author still had the right to set their house rules regardless of prior locations. \n\nThe author did give Jim a chance by talking to him privately first. Then, when Jim didn't comply, they followed up. The author's actions were in response to a direct violation of a rule they had set. Unless there's a legal requirement that allows concealed carry in private homes, but usually, even with a permit, the homeowner can restrict it. So the author isn't violating any laws here.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't wrong for enforcing their own rules in their home. The answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
