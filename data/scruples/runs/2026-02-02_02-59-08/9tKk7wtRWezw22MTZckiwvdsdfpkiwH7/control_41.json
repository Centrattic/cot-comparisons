  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for kicking a guy out of my hobby group because of his concealed gun?\nI am in a little board game group that has been meeting regularly for the past six months. We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is wrong for kicking someone out of their hobby group because of his concealed gun. The author has a right to set rules in their home, right? The situation is that Jim has a concealed carry permit and brings his gun to the game nights at the author's house. The author told Jim upfront that no guns are allowed, and Jim seems to have ignored that, leading the author to kick him out.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In many places, if someone has a concealed carry permit, they can legally carry a gun in private property unless the property owner prohibits it. The author clearly communicated their rule, so Jim's continued presence with a gun might be against that rule. Legally, the author isn't in the wrong here.\n\nThen there's the personal space aspect. The author feels uncomfortable with a gun in their home, which is their right. They're prioritizing their own safety and comfort, which is understandable. Even if Jim has the legal right to carry, the author's home is their space, and they can set boundaries.\n\nThe reactions from the other group members are mixed, but that's normal in such situations. Some might think it's a valid decision, others not. The author's decision isn't about being uptight but about respecting their own home rules.\n\nJim's response of continuing to carry and then leaving seems to be his choice. The author stood by their decision, which is their right. The follow-up texts from Jim are probably part of his frustration, but that doesn't negate the author's stance.\n\nSo putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. They communicated their rules clearly, acted on a serious matter, and maintained their home's safety as per their own comfort. Answer B.\n"
