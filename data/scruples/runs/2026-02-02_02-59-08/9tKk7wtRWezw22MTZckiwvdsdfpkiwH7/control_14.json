We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a board game group where one member, Jim, is carrying a concealed gun, and the author of the post decided to kick him out after he didn't follow the author's rule about not having guns in the house.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The author is anti-gun but had never brought it up before. They told Jim privately before the first game night at their house that he needed to leave the gun in his truck. Jim's response wasn't explicit agreement. Then, after the first session, another member told the author that Jim had the gun on him while they were in the kitchen. The author texted Jim, told him it was disrespectful, and that he couldn't come back if he continued. Jim left the group. Now, the group is split on whether the author was right.\n\nThe author's stance is that it's their house and their rules. They consider the gun issue serious, not something trivial like snacks. Jim is still texting them, sending propaganda.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (Yes) or B (No).\n\nI need to think about the right to set rules in one's home. Legally, the homeowner can set conditions for who is allowed in their house. If the author made it clear that guns aren't allowed, and Jim continued to bring one, then the author is within their rights to ask him to leave. But maybe there's a nuance in how it was handled. Did the author give Jim a clear warning first? The author did mention it privately, so he had prior notice. However, Jim's response wasn't a clear affirmation, so maybe he thought it was okay. But the author can't be responsible for how Jim interpreted the message. The second time, the author followed up, which seems reasonable.\n\nThe other group members have mixed reactions. One says it's harsh but fair, another thinks it's being a shrew. But the majority seems to agree that it's a reasonable rule. The author isn't violating any laws by setting such a rule. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B (No).\n"
