We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for kicking someone out of their hobby group because of a concealed gun. The situation is that the group moved to the author's house, and Jim, who has a concealed carry permit, was told to leave his gun in his truck. But during the first session, Jim still had the gun on him, leading the author to ask him to leave.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, concealed carry laws allow people to carry guns in public, including private property, unless the owner specifically prohibits it. Since the author owns the house, they can set rules about guns on their property. So legally, the author has the right to ask Jim to leave if he's carrying a gun, even if Jim has a permit.\n\nNext, the social implications. The author made their stance clear before the event, so Jim was aware. However, Jim didn't follow the rule, which led to the author enforcing their policy. The author's main argument is that it's their house and their rules, which is a common perspective. Others in the group have mixed reactions, but the author's right to set boundaries is a key point here.\n\nSome might argue that the author overreacted, especially if Jim was respectful and didn't cause any harm. But the author felt disrespected and unsafe, which is valid for them. The fact that Jim continued to carry the gun despite being asked not to could be seen as a violation of trust, making the author's decision more justified.\n\nAnother angle is whether the author should have given Jim another chance. But the author felt it was a serious issue and didn't want any risk. It's their house, so they have the final say. Jim chose to leave, so it's not like the author forced him against his will. The author also tried to communicate clearly before the event.\n\nConsidering all this, the author is within their rights and their own comfort zone to set such rules. While some might disagree with their decision, it's not about being right or wrong in a moral sense, but about personal boundaries. So the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
