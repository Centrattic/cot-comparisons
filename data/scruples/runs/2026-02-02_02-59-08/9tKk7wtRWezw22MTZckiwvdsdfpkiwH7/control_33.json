We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong. The scenario is about a board game group that moved to the author's house, and one member, Jim, carries a concealed gun. The author told Jim in advance that he couldn't have his gun in the house. But during the first game night, when the author was in the kitchen, Jim told someone else he still had his gun with him. The author then sent Jim a text saying he could no longer come to the house if he had a gun, leading Jim to quit the group.\n\nSo the key points here are: the author made their rules clear beforehand, but Jim didn't follow them. The author then enforced the rule after the fact. Now, the question is whether the author is at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legality. In many places, concealed carry laws allow individuals to carry guns in private residences unless the owner specifically prohibits it. The author is the homeowner here, so they have the right to set rules about guns on their property. So from a legal standpoint, the author isn't in the wrong for asking Jim to leave the group if he can't comply with that rule.\n\nThen there's the social aspect. The author is running a hobby group in their home, so they have the right to set boundaries. Jim was informed beforehand about the rule, so he had the choice to comply or not attend. Since he didn't follow through, the author enforcing the rule seems reasonable. It's a matter of personal comfort and safety, which is valid.\n\nThe other group members' reactions are mixed, but that's common in such situations. The author's stance is about their own space and comfort. Even if others think it's a bit harsh, the author isn't obligated to let someone into their home if it makes them uncomfortable. The fact that Jim continued to bring the gun despite being told not to could be seen as a breach of trust or respect, which justifies the author's decision.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the author could have handled it differently, like not making a big issue or allowing Jim to stay if he wasn't a threat. But the author clearly communicated their boundaries, and Jim didn't respect that. The author's right to enforce their own rules in their home takes precedence. So the answer would be that the author is not in the wrong.\n"
