We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about someone kicking another person out of their hobby group because the person was carrying a concealed gun. The author is anti-gun and set a rule that no guns in their house. They told Jim beforehand to leave the gun in his truck. But during the first game night, Jim had the gun on him when the author was in the kitchen. The author then told Jim he couldn't come anymore if he had a gun, leading to Jim quitting. The group is split on whether the author was right.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In the US, concealed carry laws vary by state. If Jim has a valid permit, he's legally allowed to carry. But the author's house is private property, so they can set rules about guns there. So legally, the author has the right to prohibit guns on their property. That part is clear.\n\nNext, the social aspect. The author's main point is that it's their house and their rules. They felt it was important after one incident. Jim didn't comply, so they kicked him out. The other group members are split. Some think it's fair, others think it's harsh. \n\nBut the author approached Jim first to set the rule. Jim didn't follow through, even after being told. So, the author followed through with the consequence. The problem here is whether the author overreacted. Since the author made their stance clear, and Jim didn't abide by the rule, the author is enforcing their own boundaries. \n\nHowever, some might argue that maybe the author could have given Jim another chance or communicated better. But given that the author had already set the rule, and Jim violated it, the response seems reasonable. The author is standing up for their comfort and safety in their own home. \n\nAlso, the fact that Jim is now sending propaganda links might be a separate issue, but the initial action was about enforcing a house rule. Since the author made their position clear and Jim didn't adhere, the action taken was within the author's rights as a homeowner. \n\nTherefore, I think the author is not in the wrong. They have the right to set rules for their home, and they communicated it properly. Jim's choice to not follow through led to his own decision to leave.\n"
