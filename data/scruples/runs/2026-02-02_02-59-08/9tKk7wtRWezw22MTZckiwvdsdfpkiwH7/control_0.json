We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong for kicking someone out of their hobby group because he was carrying a concealed gun. The author lives in the US, obviously, since concealed carry is a thing there.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In the US, concealed carry laws vary by state and local regulations. If Jim has a valid concealed carry permit, then by law he's allowed to carry his gun, even in someone's home. But the author is the homeowner, so they might have specific rules about guns on their property. However, there's a difference between asking someone to leave their gun outside and actually barring them from entering. If Jim's presence with a gun isn't a legal violation in their state, the author might not have the legal right to prohibit him from attending. But the author could set rules for their own home, right? Like a \"no guns\" policy as a condition for being in their house.\n\nThen there's the social aspect. The author is anti-gun, which is their right. They communicated their discomfort privately to Jim before the event. Jim didn't explicitly agree to leave the gun in his truck, so maybe there was a miscommunication. The author found out later that Jim didn't actually leave the gun, which made them feel disrespected. So the author kicked him out. The other group members are split, which shows it's a complex social issue.\n\nIs it reasonable for the author to enforce their rules strictly? If it's their home, they can set boundaries. But if Jim is allowed by law to carry there, the author might be overstepping. However, the author is within their rights to ask someone to leave if they don't follow the house rules. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Legally, maybe not, since it's their home. Socially, some might see it as harsh, but others support the author's right to their own space.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that it's a serious matter, not a trivial issue like snacks. They wanted to establish clear boundaries. The fact that Jim continued to carry there despite being asked not to could be seen as a violation of trust. The author's response was to remove him from the group, which might be a valid choice given the safety concerns, even if it's a hobby group.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would likely be B (No), the author is not in the wrong, because they have the right to their own home's rules and safety preferences. However, there's a nuance if local laws require allowing concealed carry, but the question doesn't specify the location's laws. Assuming the author's rules are within their rights, they're justified in their actions.\n"
