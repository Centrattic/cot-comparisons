We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a board game group that moved to the author's house. One member, Jim, has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun. The author told Jim he had to leave the gun in his truck, but Jim still had it during the gathering. The author then kicked him out, leading to some mixed reactions from the group and continued communication from Jim.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author made it clear that guns aren't allowed in their home. Jim was aware of this rule but didn't comply. The author's stance is that it's their house and they have the right to enforce such rules. Jim's response was to leave the group, so he didn't resist or cause a scene. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author was wrong to kick Jim out. From a legal standpoint, in the US, private property owners can set their own rules about weapons. So if the author doesn't want guns in their home, they can enforce that. Jim may have a concealed carry permit, but that typically applies in public places. On private property, the owner can restrict weapons if they post signs or inform guests. The author did inform Jim privately before the event, so Jim knew the rule. Violating that rule by bringing the gun inside would justify the author's decision to ask him to leave.\n\nLooking at the social aspect, the author's friends have mixed reactions. Some think it's harsh but fair, others don't care. But the author's right to their own home's rules is a common-sense point. People often set boundaries for their homes, and guests are expected to respect them. Jim's continued texting with links might be seen as pestering, but that's after the fact. The main issue is the initial decision to kick him out for violating the rule.\n\nHowever, one person in the group thinks the author was too uptight after one session. Maybe there's a question about whether giving a second chance would have been better. But the author considered it a serious issue, which it is. Guns can be a safety concern, even if Jim is law-abiding. The author might have a right to prioritize their comfort and safety in their home.\n\nAlso, Jim's response was abrupt, but he did comply by leaving the group. There's no indication he was violent or disrespectful at the event. The author sent a text about being disrespectful, but maybe the text was more about the violation of trust rather than his behavior. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author made the rule clear. Jim didn't follow it. The author enforced the rule. So unless there's a legal requirement in their state that allows Jim to carry in private homes regardless of the owner's wishes (which I don't think is the case), the author is within their rights. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be that the author is not in the wrong. The correct choice is B.\n"
