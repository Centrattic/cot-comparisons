We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong for kicking someone out of their hobby group because of a concealed gun. The author is anti-gun but didn't mention it before. They told Jim privately to leave the gun in his truck, but Jim still had it during the game night. Then the author kicked him out.\n\nFirst, the author says it's their house and they set the rules. So, from that perspective, they have the right to decide what's allowed in their home. Jim was carrying a gun, which the author finds unacceptable. Even though Jim didn't bring it into the house, he was still on the property with it, which the author considered disrespectful and a violation of the agreed-upon rule. \n\nBut wait, the author only asked Jim to leave the gun in the truck. If Jim was in the house, then having the gun on him would be against the rule. However, if he was just in the yard or outside, maybe the rule was less clear. But the other group member told the author that Jim had the gun with him while she was in the kitchen. The author might have felt that even being in the house with the gun is a problem, even if it's not drawn or used. \n\nThe other group members are split. Some think it's fair because it's the author's house, others think it's harsh. The key point is that the author made their stance clear before the first meeting at their house. Jim either misunderstood or didn't comply. The author then followed through after the fact, which might be seen as a reasonable enforcement of their own rules. \n\nOn the flip side, some might argue that Jim didn't bring the gun into the house, just had it on him. But concealed carry laws vary, and if it's legal for him to carry it, the author might not have a legal basis to prevent it, but that's different from social rules. The author could have a personal discomfort and set a rule, and if Jim agreed to that rule but didn't follow through, the author's reaction is justified. \n\nSo, considering personal boundaries and the author's right to their own space, it seems like the author isn't in the wrong. The answer is B.\n"
