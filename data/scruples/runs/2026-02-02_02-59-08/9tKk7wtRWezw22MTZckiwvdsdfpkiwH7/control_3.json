We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for kicking someone out of their hobby group because he was carrying a concealed gun. The main issue is whether the author overstepped by enforcing a \"no guns in my house\" rule.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In many places, concealed carry is legal, and individuals can carry firearms in private residences if permitted. However, the homeowner has the authority to set their own rules for their property. So, the author might have the right to ask Jim not to carry a gun in their home.\n\nThen there's the social aspect. The author mentioned being anti-gun, which is a personal belief. Jim had a concealed carry permit and had always carried a gun before. The author set the rule before the first meeting at their house, so there's a case to be made that they were clear. However, Jim didn't fully comply, which led to the author taking action.\n\nThe reactions from the group are mixed. Some think it's reasonable, others think it's harsh. The key point is whether the author's action was within their rights. Since it's their home, they can set boundaries. The fact that Jim didn't follow the rule after being asked might justify the author's decision.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's a nuance. If the author knew Jim was carrying and didn't want it, but Jim still did so, the author's reaction is about personal safety and comfort. They have the right to feel unsafe and enforce their rules. Jim's continued presence with a gun could be seen as disregarding the host's wishes, making the author not in the wrong.\n\nSo, considering both legal and social norms, the author isn't wrong for enforcing their house rules. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
