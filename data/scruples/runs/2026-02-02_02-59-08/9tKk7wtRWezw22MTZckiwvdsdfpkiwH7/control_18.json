We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for kicking someone out of their hobby group because he had a concealed gun. \n\nSo the situation is, the group meets at the author's house now, and one member, Jim, has a concealed carry permit. The author told Jim beforehand that no guns in the house, so he should leave it in his truck. Jim responded in a way that wasn't fully affirming. Then during the first game night at the author's house, Jim still had his gun with him when the author was in the kitchen. The author then texted Jim and told him he can't come if he's armed, leading Jim to quit. The group's reactions are mixed.\n\nFirst, the author's stance is about personal space. They made their rules clear. They own their home and can set boundaries. Even if Jim has a permit, the author's comfort and safety are their own. But maybe someone could argue that Jim was following the law by carrying, and the author was being overly strict. But then again, Jim was told beforehand and still brought the gun. So maybe the author is within their rights to enforce their own rules. \n\nJim's response might be seen as not respecting the author's wishes, which could justify the author taking action. The author didn't just kick him out without warning; they had a conversation first. The other group members have mixed opinions. Some think it's fair, others not. But the key here is the author's right to their own home. If someone is in your house and they don't follow your rules, you can ask them to leave. So in that sense, the author isn't wrong. \n\nBut wait, maybe there's a nuance. Jim might have had his gun in a legal way, but the author's rules are about not wanting guns in their home. The author didn't force him to carry, just asked him to leave it in the truck. Jim didn't comply, so the author took action. That seems reasonable. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
