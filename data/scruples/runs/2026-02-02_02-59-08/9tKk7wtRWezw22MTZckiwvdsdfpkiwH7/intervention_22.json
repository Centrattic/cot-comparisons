We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for kicking someone out of their hobby group because he had a concealed gun. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author hosts a board game group, and one member, Jim, has a concealed carry permit. The author told him in advance that guns aren't allowed in their house. Jim said he'd leave his gun in the truck, but during the first session, he had it with him while the author was in the kitchen. The author then kicked him out, leading to some mixed reactions from the group.\n\nThe author's main argument is that it's their house, and they set the rules. They didn't want guns there, so Jim violated that rule. The other person thinks the author is in the wrong because maybe it was an overreaction.\n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, the author's right to set rules in their own home is significant. Safety and comfort are personal, and guns can be a sensitive issue. If someone is uncomfortable with guns, it's reasonable to enforce a no-guns policy. The author did warn Jim beforehand, so Jim's actions were a breach of that agreement. \n\nOn the other hand, Jim has a legal concealed carry permit. If he's in a public place or a private home where he's allowed, he can carry. But the author made it clear that their home is off-limits for weapons. Jim might have misunderstood or thought he could keep it on him despite the agreement. The author's reaction was immediate and strict, which some might see as harsh, especially if Jim didn't intend to break the rule. \n\nBut since the author had already communicated the rule and Jim broke it, the author has the right to enforce the policy. It's their space, and they can set boundaries. The other group members are split, but the author's main responsibility is to their own comfort and safety. \n\nSo, considering that, I think the author isn't in the wrong. They made their stance clear, and Jim's actions violated the agreed-upon rule. The author acted within their rights as the host. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
