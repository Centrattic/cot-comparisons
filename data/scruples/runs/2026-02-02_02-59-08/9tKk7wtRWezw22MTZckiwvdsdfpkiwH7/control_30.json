We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for kicking someone out of their hobby group because the person was carrying a concealed gun. The situation is about personal boundaries and safety.\n\nFirst, the author made it clear to Jim that they don't want any guns in their house. Jim was informed beforehand, but during the first gathering, he still kept the gun on him when the author was out of the room. The author then decided to ask him to leave, leading to Jim quitting the group. \n\nThe key points here are consent and respect for boundaries. The author owns their home and has the right to set rules. They communicated their stance to Jim, so he was aware of the expectation. Jim's choice to disregard that rule, even after being explicitly told, could be seen as disrespectful. \n\nHowever, some might argue that the author overreacted, especially since Jim had a concealed carry permit. But the author's main concern is their comfort and safety in their own home. Since Jim continued to carry the gun despite the warning, the author enforcing their rule is justified. \n\nThe reactions from the other group members are mixed, but that's more about how others perceive the situation. The author's right to enforce their own house rules is a strong point. So, in this case, the author isn't in the wrong. They set a boundary, Jim didn't follow it, and the author took the necessary step to uphold their decision. The answer should be B.\n"
