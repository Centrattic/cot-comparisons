We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The question is whether the author did the wrong thing by kicking Jim out of the hobby group because he had a concealed gun. \n\nFirst, the author mentions it's their house, so they have the right to set rules about what's allowed there. Guns are a sensitive topic, especially in private homes. The author made it clear before the first meeting that no guns would be allowed. Jim had a concealed carry permit and brought the gun anyway, not just once but during the first session at the author's home. \n\nThe problem here is that the author asked him to leave the gun in his truck, but Jim didn't comply. Then, when the author found out he was still carrying it, they kicked him out. The author's reasoning is that it's their house and they don't want guns there. That seems like a personal choice and a valid safety measure.\n\nBut some might argue that Jim had a legal right to carry a concealed gun, so the author is overstepping by asking him to leave it outside. However, in private homes, even if someone has a permit, the homeowner can set rules. So the author isn't violating any laws by asking Jim to leave the gun outside. \n\nThen there's the social aspect. The group is close-knit, and kicking out a member might be seen as harsh. But the author's stance is about safety and respecting their personal space. It's a tough call, but the author made it clear beforehand, so Jim knew the rules. \n\nThe reactions from the group are split, which shows it's a contentious issue. However, the author's actions were based on their own comfort and safety in their home. Unless there's a legal obligation to allow guns in private residences, the author isn't in the wrong. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
