We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for kicking someone out of their hobby group because he had a concealed gun.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author is hosting a board game group at their house. One member, Jim, has a concealed carry permit and brings his gun. The author told Jim beforehand not to bring the gun into the house, but Jim still did it. The author then kicked him out of the group. The group's reactions are mixed. The author's reasoning is that it's their house and they set the rules.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate this. Let me consider the key points.\n\n1. **Right to Set Rules in One's Home**: The author is the host, so they have the right to set boundaries. If they don't want guns in their home, that's their choice. Legally, in the US, the owner can set such rules. But there's also the concealed carry laws. If Jim is legally allowed to carry, can the author prohibit it? Some places allow landlords and businesses to restrict firearms, but private homes might have different rules. But the author isn't a landlord, just a homeowner. Wait, in the US, the right to carry in public places can be restricted by the property owner. So if the author is hosting at their private residence, they can ask someone not to have a gun there. However, in some states, even with a permit, you might not be allowed in private homes unless the owner gives permission. So if Jim is carrying in a private home without permission, that could be illegal. But the author is in the US (since concealed carry is mentioned), but the specific state isn't given. This legal aspect is important. If the author's rules conflict with local laws, it's a problem. But assuming the author's state allows them to prohibit guns in their home, then they have the right to enforce that.\n\n2. **Communication**: The author told Jim privately before the event that he shouldn't have the gun in the house. Jim gave a non-committal response. Then, during the event, Jim had the gun on him when the author was in the kitchen. The author found out from another member. Then texted him, saying he was disrespectful and asked him to leave. Jim quit. The author's action here is not a sudden expulsion but a follow-up after the breach of the agreement. So, the author gave a warning (though maybe not a strict warning?) and then followed through when the rule was broken.\n\n3. **Reasonableness**: The author's stance is that it's their home, and gun safety is important. The other members have mixed reactions. Two think it's fair or not a problem, one thinks the author was too harsh. The key point is whether the author's rule is reasonable. Since it's about personal comfort and safety, and the author is the host, it's generally seen as reasonable. People have the right to feel safe in their own home. Even if Jim had a permit, the author can set their boundaries.\n\n4. **The Author's Actions**: The author gave a warning\u4e8b\u5148 (before the event) and then, upon a breach, took action. It's not like Jim was allowed in the first place. The author's response was to ask him not to come again if he would break the rules. That's a direct consequence but not necessarily harsh, given the infraction was a serious one (safety issue in the host's home).\n\n5. **Jim's Perspective**: Jim might feel that since he has a permit, he should be allowed to carry. But the author's private home is their space. However, if local laws require that even permit holders can't carry in private homes without the owner's permission, then Jim was in the wrong. If local laws allow him to carry in private homes, then the author is in the wrong for asking him to leave it in the truck. But the author didn't know that, so it's a conflict of rights.\n\n6. **Propaganda and Continued Contact**: After the incident, Jim is contacting the author with propaganda. This could be seen as harassment, but that's a different issue. The initial removal from the group is the main point here.\n\nPutting this together, the author is in the right because it's their home and they can set the rules. They communicated the rule beforehand, and when it was broken, they took action. The fact that Jim had a permit doesn't override the host's right to prohibit guns in their home, depending on the state. Since the author's state isn't specified, but in many US states, private homeowners can restrict firearms, the author is not in the wrong. The split reactions in the group are typical, but the author's decision is reasonable. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
