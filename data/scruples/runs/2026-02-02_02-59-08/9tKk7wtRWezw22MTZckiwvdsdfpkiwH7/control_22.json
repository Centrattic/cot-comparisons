We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the story is in the wrong for kicking someone out of their hobby group because he was carrying a concealed gun.\n\nFirst, the setup: the group moved to the author's house, and Jim, who has a concealed carry permit, was told to leave his gun in the truck. But during the first session, Jim told someone else he still had his gun when the author was away. The author then told Jim he couldn't come back if he had a gun, leading Jim to quit.\n\nAuthor's perspective: It's their house, their rules. They consider guns a serious issue, not something trivial like snacks. Jim isn't being respectful of their boundaries. The author is anti-gun, which adds to the sensitivity here.\n\nJim's side: He has a legal concealed carry permit, so he's allowed to carry. He might have thought it's okay to have the gun with him, maybe not realizing the author's discomfort or the specific request to leave it in the truck.\n\nLegal perspective: Concealed carry laws vary, but in many places, having a concealed gun is legal as long as the person has the permit. However, the author's house is private property, and the owner can set rules about weapons. So legally, the author has the right to ask Jim to leave the gun outside.\n\nSocial dynamics: The group is split. Some think the author was right to enforce their rules, others think it was too harsh. The author might be seen as overreacting if Jim had never caused issues before. But the author emphasizes that it's a serious matter for them.\n\nEthically, it's about respecting personal boundaries. The author made their stance clear initially, and Jim didn't comply. The author then enforced their rule after the first incident, which could be seen as reasonable since they set the expectation upfront.\n\nJim's response might indicate he didn't take the initial request seriously, so the author followed through. The ongoing texts from Jim suggest he's not respecting the author's wishes post-incident, which might fuel the author's decision.\n\nIn summary, the author is in their right to enforce their house rules. While Jim had a legal right to carry, the author's home is a private space where they can set conditions. The key is whether the author's action was reasonable given the context. Since they communicated their rules and Jim didn't follow through, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
