We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a board game group that moved to the author's house. One member, Jim, has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun. The author told Jim not to have the gun in the house, but Jim still had it during a game night. The author then kicked him out, leading to mixed reactions from the group.\n\nHmm, first, the author's house. So they have the right to set their own rules. The author made it clear that no guns were allowed. Jim was told privately to leave his gun in the truck. But he still brought it in, according to another group member. The author then told Jim he couldn't come if he had a gun. Jim quit.\n\nThe user thinks the author is wrong, but I need to evaluate. Let me break it down. Legally, in the US, the author has the right to deny someone entry to their property. So if Jim was carrying a gun in violation of the host's rules, the author is within their rights. But in some states, concealed carry is allowed, and the owner can ask someone not to carry on their property. However, depending on the state, the landlord might have different rules. But the author is the host, so their rules apply.\n\nBut the question isn't about legality, it's about being in the wrong socially or morally. The author made their rules known. Jim wasn't compliant. The author enforced the rule. Was that fair? The author says they're anti-gun, but the issue is about safety and trust. If someone is carrying a gun despite being told not to, it's a breach of trust. The author might feel that having a gun in their home makes them uncomfortable, which is valid.\n\nThe other group members are split. Some think it's harsh but fair, others not. But the author's house, their rules. They can't have guests who violate their personal boundaries. So the author isn't in the wrong. They had a legitimate reason. Jim didn't follow the rules, so the author removed him. That's not wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
