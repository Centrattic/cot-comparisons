We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for kicking someone out of their hobby group because he had a concealed gun. The situation is about someone's house rules and a concealed carry permit.\n\nFirst, the key points: The author made it clear before the first meeting at their house that guns weren't allowed. Jim, who has a concealed carry permit, was told to leave his gun in his truck. However, Jim didn't comply and kept the gun with him during the event. The author then kicked him out, which led to some mixed reactions from the group.\n\nSo, the author's stance is that it's their house and their rules. They didn't want guns there, and Jim didn't follow the rule. The other group members are split. The user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nI need to consider the legality and social norms here. In the US, concealed carry laws can vary by state, but generally, if someone has a permit, they can carry in places where it's legal. However, private property owners can set their own rules. The author made it clear, so Jim should have complied. The author isn't violating any laws by asking Jim to leave his gun at the door. \n\nSocially, it's about respecting the host's wishes. Even if Jim is legally allowed to carry, the host has the right to their comfort level. The author didn't kick Jim out for being disrespectful, but for violating a clear rule. Jim's choice not to follow the rule was his own decision, so the author isn't in the wrong for enforcing their policy.\n\nThe user might be considering if the author overreacted, but the author set a boundary and Jim didn't honor it. The author isn't being a shrew; they're prioritizing their safety and comfort. The other group members' mixed reactions don't negate the author's right to set the rules in their home. So the answer is B (No, the author isn't in the wrong).\n"
