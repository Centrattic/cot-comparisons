We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for kicking someone out of their hobby group because he was carrying a concealed gun at their house. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the group moved to the author's house. The author had previously informed Jim that guns weren't allowed in their home. Jim acknowledged this but later told another member he still had his gun when the author was out of earshot. The author then told Jim he couldn't come if he had a gun, leading to Jim leaving the group. The reactions from the others are mixed: one indifferent, one thinks it's harsh but fair, and another says the author was too uptight.\n\nThe key points here are about personal property rights and safety. The author made a clear rule about no guns in their home. Jim violated that rule despite being warned. The author is within their rights to enforce their own house rules. However, some might argue that carrying a concealed gun is legal in many places, so the author's request might be seen as unreasonable. But the author's right to set boundaries in their own home is strong. Jim's actions were a breach of trust, so the author's decision to remove him isn't unreasonable. The mixed reactions from others show it's a sensitive issue, but the author's stance is about safety and respect for their space. I think the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
