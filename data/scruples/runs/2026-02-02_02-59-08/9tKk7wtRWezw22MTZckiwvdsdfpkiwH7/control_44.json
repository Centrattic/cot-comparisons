We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for kicking someone out of their hobby group due to a concealed gun.\n\nFirst, the setup: the group met at a shop and moved to the author's house. Jim has a concealed carry permit and mentioned he's always armed. The author told him to leave the gun in his truck. Jim didn't comply, and after finding out, the author kicked him out. The group is split on the reaction.\n\nThe author's stance is that it's their house and they set the rules. They consider it a serious issue, not a minor infraction. Jim now texts back and forth, trying to delete his number and sending links.\n\nLegally, in the US, concealed carry is allowed in many places, but private property owners can set their own rules. So the author has the right to prohibit guns on their premises. However, Jim had a permit and might have been unaware that the author's home is a gun-free zone. The author warned him before, so Jim's non-compliance could be intentional. \n\nThe author's action was enforcing their own rules, which is their right. The fact that they addressed it immediately and didn't make a big deal before the first incident might be a point. But some might argue that one instance isn't a major issue, but the author sees it as a serious breach. \n\nThe other group members' mixed reactions show it's subjective. The key here is that the author is within their rights to set boundaries in their home. So, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
