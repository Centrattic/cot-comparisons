We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a board game group that moved to the author's house, and one member, Jim, carries a concealed gun. The author told Jim to leave the gun in his truck, but Jim still brought it, leading the author to kick him out. The group's reactions are mixed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author made a rule: no guns in their house. They communicated this privately to Jim before the first meeting at their house. Jim acknowledged, but then later, another person told the author that Jim had the gun with him during the session. The author then told Jim he couldn't come if he had the gun, leading Jim to quit.\n\nThe author's stance is that it's their house and their rules. Legally, in the US, the right to carry a concealed weapon varies by state. However, private property owners can usually set their own rules regarding guns on their premises. So if the state allows the author to prohibit guns in their home, then they are within their rights. But if the state requires that individuals can carry concealed guns in private homes unless prohibited, then maybe the author can't enforce that. But since the author is in a hobby group and owns the house, they might have the authority to set such a rule.\n\nJim's response was to leave the group, which is his choice. The author's decision could be seen as upholding their own safety and comfort, which is important. However, some might argue that the author overreacted, especially if Jim didn't intend to bring the gun into the house but had it on him for protection. But the author's rule was clear, and Jim's presence with a concealed gun, even if not in the house, might be a concern depending on the situation. The author could feel unsafe knowing someone has a weapon nearby, even if it's not in the house. \n\nThe group's mixed reactions suggest different perspectives. One person thinks it's fair, another is indifferent, and another thinks it's harsh. The author's reasoning is about safety and personal boundaries, which are valid. On the other hand, some might say that the author should have discussed it more or given Jim a second chance, but the first incident was a serious issue, not something trivial like snacks. \n\nSo considering all that, the author was within their rights to set the rule and enforce it, especially since they communicated it in advance. Kicking someone out for violating a clear safety rule in their own home seems justified. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
