We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The question is whether the author was in the wrong for asking Jim to leave the board game group because he had a concealed gun in their house. \n\nFirst, the setup: the group meets at the author's house. Jim has a concealed carry permit and always carries a gun. The author told him beforehand that he couldn't have the gun in the house, so it should stay in the truck. Jim responded vaguely, maybe not fully agreeing. Then, during the first meeting at the author's home, Jim had the gun with him when the author was in the kitchen. The author found out and kicked him out.\n\nSo, the author's reasoning is that it's their house and they have the right to set rules. They're anti-gun, which is a personal choice. The issue here is about respecting someone's personal space and the rules of the host. \n\nBut then there's the perspective of Jim. Since he has a concealed carry permit, he's legally allowed to have a gun in his vehicle, right? Maybe he was in a state where it's legal to carry in a vehicle with a permit. If the author asked him to leave the gun in the truck, then technically Jim was following the rules by keeping it in the truck. But during the meeting, he had it with him, which the author found out. \n\nThe author's action was to kick him out because he violated their rule. The author could argue it's their right as the host. However, the question is whether this was a reasonable rule. Since the group had met at a hobby shop before, maybe the author's house is a different setting. The author had warned him beforehand, so maybe the rule was clear. If Jim didn't comply, then the author has the right to enforce it. \n\nBut some might argue that Jim was within his legal rights to carry the gun. However, the host can set their own rules. The author isn't saying Jim can't have the gun elsewhere, just in their home. The issue is about personal safety and comfort. The author is anti-gun, so the presence of a gun in their house is a deal-breaker. \n\nOn the other hand, some might think it's overreacting because it's only one meeting and Jim had done it once. The author's friend who thought it was harsh but fair might see the author's right to set rules but question if it's too strict. Another person thought the author was a \"shrew,\" which implies being overly controlling. \n\nThe key points here are: the author is the host, can set rules, and the rule about guns in the house is reasonable. Jim violated that rule. The author had warned him, and after the infraction, the author took action. Legally, the author has the right to prohibit guns on their property. So, the author isn't in the wrong. But some might debate the sensitivity to Jim's rights, but as the host, it's reasonable. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because it's their home and they have the right to enforce their rules regarding guns.\n"
