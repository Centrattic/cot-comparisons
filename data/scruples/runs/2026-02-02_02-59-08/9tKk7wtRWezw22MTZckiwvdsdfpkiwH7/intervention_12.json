We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for kicking someone out of their hobby group because that person had a concealed gun.\n\nFirst, the author hosts game nights at their house. They specifically told Jim not to bring the gun into the house. Jim mentioned he had a concealed carry permit and was armed. The author made it clear that guns weren't allowed in their home. Jim brought the gun anyway, despite being told otherwise. The author then asked him to leave the group.\n\nNow, the key points here: The author is in their own home, so they have the right to set rules. They communicated the rule beforehand. Jim didn't comply, so the author followed through. The other group members are split, but the author's stance is about safety and their personal boundaries.\n\nI need to consider if the author overstepped. Concealed carry laws vary, but generally, if someone is on private property, the owner can set conditions. The author didn't ask Jim to relinquish the gun, just to not bring it into the house. Jim's non-compliance led to the author removing him. It seems the author acted within their rights as a host. So the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
