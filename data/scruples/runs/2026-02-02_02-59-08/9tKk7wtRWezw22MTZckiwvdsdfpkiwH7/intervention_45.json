We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for kicking someone out of their hobby group because he was carrying a concealed gun. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author hosts a board game group at their house. They've known Jim for six months, and he has a concealed carry permit. The author is anti-gun but hadn't addressed it before. Before moving to their house, the author privately told Jim not to bring his gun. Jim responded in a way that wasn't exactly agreeing. Then, during the first game night, Jim had the gun with him when the author was in the kitchen. The author found out through another group member and confronted Jim, leading him to quit the group. The group's reactions are mixed.\n\nThe key points here are about personal space and safety. The author's home is their own, and they have the right to set rules for their property. Even though Jim has a legal concealed carry permit, the author can choose not to allow guns in their home. The author didn't just kick him out on a whim; they had a prior discussion and then addressed the issue when it happened. Jim didn't comply with the agreed-upon rule, so the author enforced their boundary.\n\nSome might argue that Jim should have respected the prior agreement, but the author had the right to enforce their rule. The fact that the author gave a heads-up and then followed through seems reasonable. The other group members' mixed reactions don't necessarily mean the author was wrong. The author's stance is about their own comfort and safety in their home. So, I think the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
