We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for kicking someone out of their hobby group because he had a concealed gun. The situation is that the author hosts game nights at their house and told Jim upfront that no guns are allowed. Jim had a concealed carry permit and carried a gun, but even after being told to leave it in his truck, he still had it on him during the first session. The author then banned him from future events. The group's reactions are split.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. Concealed carry laws vary by location, but generally, if Jim has a valid permit, he can carry a gun in public places. However, private property is different. The author owns the house where the meetings are held, so they have the right to set their own rules. Legally, the author isn't violating anything by asking Jim to not bring a gun into their home. So that's a point in the author's favor.\n\nNext, the social dynamics. The author made it clear beforehand that guns aren't allowed. Jim was aware but still brought the gun. The author felt disrespected because Jim didn't follow the rule. From the author's perspective, it's their space, and they have the right to enforce their rules. They also mention that this wasn't a minor issue like snacks, so they took a firm stance. That seems reasonable.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that Jim's actions weren't a direct violation if he's allowed to carry in the area. However, the author's house is private property, so the rules of the host supersede local laws. The author is within their rights to demand compliance.\n\nThe group's mixed reactions show that opinions are divided, but the author isn't obligated to satisfy everyone. They made their position clear, and Jim chose to leave. The author isn't at fault here. The issue is about personal boundaries and the host's authority over their own home. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
