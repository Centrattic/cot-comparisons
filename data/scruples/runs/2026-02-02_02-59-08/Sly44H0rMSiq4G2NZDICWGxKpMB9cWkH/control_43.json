When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the WIBTA (Would I Be A Twat/Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author receiving an inheritance from a \"play aunt\" who wasn't a blood relative. The author helped care for the aunt along with their actual aunt by doing chores like shoveling snow and cutting grass. The aunt left her property and money to the author, but her real relatives are upset and considering contesting the will.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. The key points are: the author and their aunt did the chores without expecting payment, the play aunt's actual relatives weren't close, and the author is being told they should keep the inheritance. The author is conflicted because they don't want to give up the inheritance to the relatives who weren't around, but they're worried about being an asshole.\n\nLegally, the author isn't in the wrong here because the will is a legal document, and the executor (the actual aunt) is distributing it as per the deceased's wishes. The author wasn't expecting anything and even helped out of kindness. The relatives' dissatisfaction doesn't legally affect the author's right to the inheritance if the will is valid. However, the moral aspect is trickier. The author might feel guilty because the relatives are upset, but the author's family was the one who actually supported the aunt in her later years. The author didn't exploit the situation for personal gain and even mentions not expecting compensation. The husband's advice that it's up to the author to decide reinforces that the decision is personal. The relatives' lack of presence and the author's contributions argue in favor of the author keeping the inheritance. So, the answer is likely B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
