When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about an inheritance from a \"play aunt,\" who wasn't a blood relative but was close. The key points here are the relationship, the care provided by the author and their family, and the conflicting claims from the play aunt's relatives.\n\nFirst, the author and their family helped care for the play aunt for years, doing chores and spending time with her during holidays. The play aunt left her estate to the author, and the author's actual aunt is the executor. The relatives are upset and considering contesting the will, but they weren't close. The author is conflicted but feels justified in keeping the inheritance because the relatives weren't involved. The husband says it's up to them.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong if they keep the inheritance. Legally, if the will is valid, the author has the right to the inheritance. Morally, it's trickier. The author had a close relationship and provided care, which the play aunt appreciated. The relatives were distant, so the author might feel it's fair. However, maybe the relatives have a claim, especially if they believe they should inherit. But since the will is already in place and the relatives haven't approached the author, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They're following the deceased's wishes. The answer might be B, not in the wrong.\n"
