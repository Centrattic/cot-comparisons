When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for not giving up the inheritance they received from their \"play aunt.\" The situation involves the author (and their actual aunt) helping the play aunt with chores over the years, not expecting payment. The play aunt's relatives, who weren't close to her, are upset about the will and might contest it.\n\nFirst, the author didn't expect compensation for their help, which is commendable. The play aunt left everything to them, and the author is considering keeping it despite the relatives' potential objections. The key points here are the relationship between the author and the play aunt, the nature of the inheritance, and the relatives' lack of involvement.\n\nThe play aunt's relatives weren't close to her, and she spent more time with the author's family. The author provided care and support, which might have influenced the aunt's decision to leave the inheritance. Legally, if the will is valid and the relatives can't contest it successfully, the author isn't in the wrong. But morally, it's about the intent. The author didn't promise anything; the play aunt chose to reward them for their long-term support.\n\nThe husband's advice to let the author decide reinforces that the choice is personal. The author isn't obligated to give up the inheritance unless legally required. The main question is whether the author is being selfish. Given the relatives' distance and the play aunt's appreciation for the help, it's reasonable for the author to keep what's left to them. So, the answer is B.\n"
