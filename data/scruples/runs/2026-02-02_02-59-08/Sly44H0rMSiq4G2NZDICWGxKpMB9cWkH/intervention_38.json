When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the WIBTA scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about an inheritance from a \"play aunt,\" who left her estate to the author. The key points are:\n\n1. The author and their actual aunt helped take care of the play aunt for years, doing chores like shoveling snow and mowing the lawn. It wasn't a huge amount of work but was consistently done over the years.\n2. The play aunt wasn't related by blood but was considered a \"play aunt.\" She wasn't particularly close to her own relatives, who haven't been around much.\n3. The executor (the author's actual aunt) informed the author that the play aunt left her property and money to them. The relatives are upset and might contest the will, but they haven't approached the author directly.\n4. The author feels annoyed by the relatives' involvement and is considering keeping the inheritance. The husband says it's up to them.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to determine if that's the case. \n\nFirst, legally, the will is valid unless contested. If the relatives contest it, they might need to prove undue influence or other issues. But the author was taking care of the play aunt, which might be seen as a legitimate reason for being in the will. However, morally, the author is deciding whether to accept the inheritance despite relatives being upset.\n\nThe main ethical question is whether the author should honor the will's terms, especially since they provided care and the relatives were not present. The author's justification is that they were the ones who supported the play aunt, not the relatives. However, if the relatives are valid heirs (even if distant), the author might be seen as taking something that legally belongs to them. But if the play aunt had the legal right to leave it to the author, then the author isn't in the wrong. \n\nThe key here is whether the author is morally obligated to share the inheritance despite the will. Since the play aunt left it to the author, the author isn't in the wrong unless there's a legal obligation to share. The relatives contesting might not hold up if the will is valid. The author's annoyance is understandable given the care provided. \n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because the will reflects the play aunt's wishes. The relatives might have a legal standing, but the author isn't at fault for following the will. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
