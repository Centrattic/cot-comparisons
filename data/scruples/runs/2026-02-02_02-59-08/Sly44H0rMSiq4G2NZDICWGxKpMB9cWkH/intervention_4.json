When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person (author) who received an inheritance is in the wrong. The situation involves a \"play aunt,\" who isn't a blood relative but was treated kindly. The author and their family did chores for her over the years, and now she left her estate to them. The relatives are upset and might contest the will.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. If the will is valid and properly executed, then the author is entitled to the inheritance as per the deceased's wishes. The question is about whether the author is morally or ethically in the wrong, not legally. \n\nThe author mentions that the play aunt's relatives weren't close and didn't visit much. The author feels justified because they provided care and support. The husband says the decision is the author's. The key here is the intent of the deceased. If the play aunt intended to leave it to the author, then it's her rightful inheritance. The author isn't obligated to give it up unless there's a legal challenge. \n\nHowever, some might argue that the relatives have a claim, but given their lack of involvement, the author's position is stronger. The author isn't doing anything wrong by following the will. The answer likely is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
