When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not giving up an inheritance they were left by their \"play aunt.\" The play aunt isn't a blood relative, so the author didn't necessarily expect to inherit anything.\n\nFrom the context, the author and their actual aunt helped the play aunt with tasks like snow shoveling and yard work over the years. They mention it wasn't a lot of extra work since they were nearby. The play aunt's actual relatives are upset and might contest the will, but they weren't close to her. The author's aunt, who is the executor, advises them to keep everything. The author is conflicted but annoyed that the relatives are now involved after not being around for years.\n\nLegally, if the will is valid and the author is named as a beneficiary, they have a right to the inheritance. The relatives contesting the will would need to prove that the will was not made properly (like undue influence, lack of mental capacity, etc.), which isn't mentioned here. The author's actions are based on the will's instructions, so unless there's a legal issue with the will, the author isn't in the wrong. Emotionally, the author might feel conflicted, but legally and ethically, they followed the play aunt's wishes. The husband's advice to decide for themselves supports that the author isn't obligated to give up the inheritance. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
