When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for not giving up an inheritance they received. \n\nFirst, the key points: The \"play aunt\" (not a blood relative) passed away and left her estate to the author through her actual aunt, who's the executor. The relatives of the play aunt are upset and considering contesting the will. The author and their family helped care for the play aunt over the years, doing chores and such. The author's husband says it's their decision, but they're worried about being seen as an asshole.\n\nNow, the main issue is whether the author is in the wrong by keeping the inheritance. Legally, if the will is valid and the executor followed proper procedures, the author is entitled to it. The relatives haven't directly approached the author, just talked to the executor. The author's family had a long-standing relationship where they provided care, which might justify the bequest as per the play aunt's wishes.\n\nMoral aspects: The author didn't expect compensation for their help but was left the inheritance. The relatives weren't close, often absent, and didn't visit. The author's actions (keeping the inheritance) align with the play aunt's expressed wishes. The relatives' potential contest might be based on their lack of involvement versus the author's family's presence.\n\nPossible arguments against the author: Maybe the relatives should get a portion, but the play aunt's will is the key legal document here. Since the relatives haven't approached the author directly, contesting the will could be a legal matter, but the author isn't obligated to give up what was left to them. The author's annoyance at the relatives' involvement is understandable given their lack of prior support.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong because they're following the deceased's wishes and the relatives haven't taken formal action against them. The author's decision to keep the inheritance is both legally sound and morally justified given the circumstances.\n"
