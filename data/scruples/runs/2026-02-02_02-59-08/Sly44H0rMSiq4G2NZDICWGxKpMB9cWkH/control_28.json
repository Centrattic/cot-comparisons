When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong if they don't give up the inheritance they received from their \"play aunt.\" The situation is that the aunt, who wasn't a blood relative, left her property and money to the person in question. The aunt had been taking care of her and other family members for years, and the relatives are upset about the will.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The person in question was named in the will, and the executor (their actual aunt) told them to keep everything. The relatives haven't officially contested the will yet, but they've mentioned it. Legally, if the will is valid and properly executed, the person isn't obligated to give up the inheritance. They didn't do anything illegal by accepting it.\n\nThen there's the moral side. The person helped care for the play aunt for years, and the aunt didn't consider them family. The relatives weren't around much, so the person might feel they were closer. The husband says it's up to them. The question is whether they're being an asshole by not giving anything to the relatives.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, it's a bit tricky. If the relatives are not close and the care was provided to the play aunt, it's reasonable for the person to feel they were the ones who deserved the inheritance. However, if the relatives are blood relatives, even if they were distant, there might be an expectation to consider them. But since the play aunt chose to leave everything to them, the person might feel it's her right to do so.\n\nThe key points here are the legal validity of the will, the intentions of the deceased, and the relationships involved. Since the will is valid, and the deceased made a choice, the person isn't in the wrong legally. Morally, it's a judgment call, but given the circumstances, they might not be in the wrong because the relatives weren't involved in her care. The answer would likely be B, No.\n"
