When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not giving up an inheritance. The setup is that the author, along with their actual aunt, helped out a \"play aunt\" with tasks like snow shoveling and gardening. The play aunt didn't have kids, and the actual aunt is the executor of her estate. The play aunt left her property and money to the author, but her real relatives are upset and might contest the will. The author is considering keeping the inheritance, and the husband says it's up to them.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are the legal and moral aspects. Legally, if the will was properly executed, the author has a right to the inheritance. The relatives contesting might not have a legal standing if they weren't close and didn't care for the play aunt. Morally, the author and their aunt helped out the play aunt over the years, and she was nice to them. The relatives weren't around, so the author feels justified in keeping the inheritance.\n\nThe user is asking for a yes or no answer (A or B). The question is whether the author is wrong. From the information given, the play aunt left the inheritance intentionally, and the relatives weren't involved. The author's reasoning is that they provided care and the relatives were absent. So, morally, maybe not in the wrong. Legally, if the will is valid, then they have the right. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
