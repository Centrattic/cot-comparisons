When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they'd be an asshole for not giving up an inheritance they were left by a \"play aunt.\" The key points here are the relationship dynamics, the history of helping the play aunt, and the relatives' potential contesting the will.\n\nFirst, the author and their family helped the play aunt with chores for years without expecting payment. The play aunt was close to them, even helping with college letters for their kids. The relatives weren't around much, and the play aunt spent holidays with the author's family. The executor (actual aunt) says they should keep everything, but the relatives are upset and might contest the will.\n\nNow, legally, if the will is valid and the relatives aren't mentioned in it, the author might have a right to the inheritance. However, the question is about moral responsibility. The author feels they did a lot for the play aunt, and the relatives weren't present. The relatives might have a legal claim, but contesting could be time-consuming. The author is annoyed they're even involved now.\n\nThe husband says it's up to the author. So, the main issue is whether keeping the inheritance is morally wrong. Since the play aunt clearly left it to them, and the relatives weren't close, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They might feel conflicted, but the actions align with the play aunt's wishes. The relatives' potential contest is a legal matter, not necessarily a moral one. The author's annoyance is justified given the relatives' lack of involvement. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
