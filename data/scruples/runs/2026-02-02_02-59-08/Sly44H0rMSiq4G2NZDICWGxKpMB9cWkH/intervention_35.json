When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for accepting the inheritance as per the will. The author and their family helped the \"play aunt\" with chores for years, and she left her estate to them. The relatives are upset and might contest the will.\n\nFirst, the legal aspect: If the will is valid and the relatives didn't have a prior claim or right to contest, then the author is within their legal rights to keep the inheritance. The will reflects the deceased's wishes, so honoring it is the right thing to do. The relatives not being close or not participating in her care might make their claims less valid emotionally, but legally, unless there's undue influence or fraud, the will stands.\n\nMoral aspect: The author's family provided care and support, which the play aunt acknowledged by leaving the inheritance to them. The relatives weren't involved, so the author might feel they have a stronger moral claim. The husband suggests it's their decision, which adds to the idea that the author isn't obligated to share.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the relatives, as blood relations, should have been considered. But since they were distant, the play aunt had the right to choose her beneficiary. The fact that the author didn't expect compensation and the inheritance is a token of appreciation complicates things. The key is whether the will was made freely and the relatives have grounds to contest. Without legal issues, the author isn't in the wrong. So the answer would be B.\n"
