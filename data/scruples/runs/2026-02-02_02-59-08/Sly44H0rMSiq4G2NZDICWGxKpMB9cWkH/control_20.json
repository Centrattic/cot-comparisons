When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not giving up an inheritance from their play aunt. Let me read through the details again to make sure I understand.\n\nSo, the author's play aunt (not a blood relative) passed away. The author and their actual aunt, who is the executor, used to help the play aunt with things like snow shoveling and yard work. They didn't expect payment but did it because the play aunt was nice to them when they were a kid and helped their kids with college stuff. The play aunt left her property and money to the author. The relatives are unhappy and might contest the will but haven't approached the author directly. The author is considering keeping the inheritance because the relatives weren't around much, and the play aunt spent time with them instead. The husband says it's up to the author, but the author is worried about being an \"asshole.\"\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. If the will is valid and the play aunt legally bequeathed her assets to the author, then legally the author has the right to inherit. The relatives contesting the will would have to go through legal channels, and unless there's a reason the will is invalid (like lack of mental capacity, undue influence, etc.), the author is on solid ground.\n\nThen there's the moral or ethical angle. The author helped the play aunt and their actual aunt for years without expecting payment. The play aunt's relatives weren't close, so the author might feel they were the de facto family. The play aunt's actions in the will reflect her gratitude, so ethically, the author might feel they did the right thing by accepting the inheritance as intended.\n\nHowever, the relatives are upset. The author could consider giving them a portion, but the question is whether the author is wrong for not doing so. The author isn't under any obligation unless the will is contested successfully. Since the relatives haven't talked to the author directly, maybe the author could offer to share, but they're not in the wrong for not doing so if the will is valid.\n\nI think the key here is the validity of the will and the lack of obligation on the author's part. The author isn't in the wrong because the play aunt chose to leave the inheritance to them, and the relatives haven't proven any legal issues with the will. The author's actions are in line with the deceased's wishes, so the answer should be B (No).\n"
