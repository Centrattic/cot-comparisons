When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in the given situation. The scenario involves an inheritance from a \"play aunt\" who left property and money to the author. The author's actual aunt is the executor and wants them to keep everything, but the play aunt's relatives are upset and might contest the will.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. The article mentions that the play aunt's will was left to the author, and the relatives are considering contesting it. But if the will is valid and the relatives don't have a legal standing to challenge it, then the author is within their rights to keep the inheritance. However, if the will is being contested successfully, that could change things.\n\nThen there's the moral or social aspect. The author helped care for the play aunt, which the play aunt appreciated. The relatives were not around, so maybe the author feels justified in keeping the inheritance. But the author's husband says it's up to them. The question is whether it's morally wrong to keep the inheritance despite relatives being upset.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. They might feel that the author should share or give something to the relatives, even though the play aunt didn't specify that. But legally, if the will is valid, the author isn't in the wrong. Morally, it's more subjective. The author might be seen as not sharing with the relatives, but the play aunt's wishes were to give it to the author. The relatives not being close could mean the play aunt had her reasons for leaving the inheritance to the author instead.\n\nSo the answer would depend on whether the author is legally bound to share the inheritance. If not, then the author isn't in the wrong. If the will is being contested and the court decides the relatives have a claim, then maybe the author is in a legal bind. But the question is about being in the wrong, which is more about moral obligation. The author followed the play aunt's wishes, so they might not be in the wrong morally either.\n"
