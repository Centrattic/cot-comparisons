When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (who is referred to as \"I\" in the original text) is in the wrong for not giving up an inheritance they received from their \"play aunt.\" The situation involves the author's actual aunt being the executor of the play aunt's estate. The play aunt left her property and money to the author, and the relatives are upset, possibly planning to contest the will.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. If the will was properly executed and the author is a valid beneficiary, then legally they have the right to the inheritance. The key points here are whether the will is valid and if the relatives have any legal standing to contest it. Since the author's actual aunt is the executor and she's told the author to keep everything, it's possible the will is legally sound. If the relatives haven't officially contested the will, the author isn't in legal trouble yet.\n\nThen there's the ethical side. The author was doing favors for the play aunt, helping out with chores and such, and didn't expect compensation. The play aunt had a relationship with the author's actual aunt, and the author didn't anticipate any financial reward. Now, the play aunt's relatives are upset because they weren't included, even though they weren't close. The author feels justified because they were present and helpful, and the relatives weren't around. The author's husband supports their decision to keep the inheritance as per the will.\n\nThe main question is whether the author is morally wrong for following the will's instructions. The author wasn't expecting anything, but the play aunt chose to leave it to them. The relatives might feel slighted, but if the author had a meaningful relationship with the play aunt, it's reasonable to accept the inheritance. The relatives' potential to contest the will is a separate issue; the author isn't responsible for their dissatisfaction unless there's evidence of coercion or undue influence in the will's creation.\n\nSo, putting it all together, legally the author is likely fine, and ethically, given the circumstances, they're not in the wrong for following the play aunt's wishes. The answer should be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
