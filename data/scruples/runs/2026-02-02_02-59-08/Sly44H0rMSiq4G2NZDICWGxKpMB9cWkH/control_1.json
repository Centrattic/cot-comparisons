When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not giving up the inheritance they received from their \"play aunt.\" The aunt in question, who isn't a blood relative, left her estate to the author. The author mentions that they and their family did chores for her over the years, but didn't expect payment. Now the play aunt's actual relatives are upset and considering contesting the will.\n\nFirst, the key points here are the will's validity and the intentions of the deceased. The author's actual aunt is the executor and says to keep everything. The play aunt left the inheritance to the author, so legally, if the will is valid, the author is entitled to it. The relatives haven't taken legal action, just expressed dissatisfaction. The author is conflicted but doesn't feel obligated to give them anything since the relatives weren't close to her and the author's family was there for her when needed.\n\nMoral considerations: The author and their family provided care and support, which the play aunt appreciated enough to leave the inheritance. The author wasn't expecting compensation before, so keeping the inheritance as per the will seems fair. The relatives not being involved for years adds to the argument that the play aunt's decision was intentional. The husband also says it's up to the author. Legally, unless the will is contested and invalidated, the author is in the right. Morally, it's about fulfilling the deceased's wishes. The author isn't in the wrong here. Answer B."
