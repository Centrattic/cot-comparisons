When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the original question is in the wrong. The situation involves an inheritance from a \"play aunt\" who wasn't a blood relative. The key points are:\n\n1. The writer and their family helped care for the play aunt over the years, doing chores without expecting payment.\n2. The play aunt left her estate to the writer, which includes her home, car, and life insurance. The actual aunt (executor) supports this.\n3. The play aunt's relatives, who weren't close, are upset and might contest the will.\n4. The writer is considering keeping the inheritance, feeling annoyed that the distant relatives are now involved when they weren't around when the play aunt needed support.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to decide if \"A\" (yes, wrong) or \"B\" (not wrong) is the right answer based on the situation.\n\nFirst, the play aunt's will was her choice. She had the right to leave her assets as she wished, especially if she felt the writer and their family were more supportive. The relatives not being close isn't the writer's fault. The writer isn't obligated to share the inheritance unless legally required. The relatives contesting the will might not succeed if the will is valid and they weren't in the will. The writer's annoyance is understandable since they were actively involved in the play aunt's life, unlike the distant relatives. The husband's support for the writer's decision also suggests that this is a personal choice.\n\nLegally, unless the will is contested successfully, the writer is within their rights to take the inheritance. The writer isn't in the wrong for following the play aunt's wishes, especially since there's no indication of coercion or undue influence. The relatives' potential contest is their issue, but the writer can't be blamed for that. Therefore, the answer is B\u2014author is not in the wrong.\n"
