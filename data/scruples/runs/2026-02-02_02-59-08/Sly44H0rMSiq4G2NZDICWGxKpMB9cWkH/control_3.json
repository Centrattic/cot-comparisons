When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author's \"play aunt,\" who isn't a blood relative, left her property and money to the author. The author didn't expect anything because they helped out with chores, but the play aunt's relatives are upset and might contest the will.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. If the will was properly drawn up, then the author is the rightful heir. The fact that the relatives didn't visit much but are now contesting could complicate things. But since the author's actual aunt is the executor, maybe the will is valid. However, if the relatives can prove the will was made under undue influence or wasn't properly executed, there might be legal challenges.\n\nEthically, the author helped the play aunt for years without expecting payment. The play aunt left her estate to them as a gesture of appreciation. The relatives haven't been around, so the author might feel they don't deserve the inheritance. The husband's opinion is that the decision is up to the author. \n\nThe key points here are intent and fairness. The play aunt clearly intended to leave it to the author, which is a personal decision. Since the relatives weren't close, the author isn't obligated to give them anything. The author's annoyance is understandable given their long-term support. So, unless there's a legal reason to doubt the will's validity, the author isn't in the wrong for taking the inheritance as per the play aunt's wishes.\n"
