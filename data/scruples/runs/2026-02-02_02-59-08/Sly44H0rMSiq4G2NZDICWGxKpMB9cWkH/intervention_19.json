When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not giving up the inheritance they received from the \"play aunt.\" Let's break down the situation.\n\nSo, the play aunt wasn't a blood relative. The author and their actual aunt did chores for her, like shoveling snow and cutting grass. They didn't expect payment, but the play aunt was nice to the author as a kid and helped their kids with college stuff. Now, the play aunt left her property and money to the author. Her relatives are upset and might contest the will. The author's actual aunt, who is the executor, says to keep everything, but the author is annoyed because the relatives weren't around much. The husband says it's up to the author. The question is if the author is in the wrong for keeping it.\n\nFirst, legally, the author isn't in the wrong because the play aunt chose to leave her estate to them. If the will is valid, the author has the right to inherit. The relatives aren't blood relatives, and the play aunt didn't have kids. The author's family was the one who took care of her, so maybe she felt they deserved the inheritance.\n\nBut morally, maybe the author should share? The relatives might feel entitled, even if they weren't close. But the author argues that the relatives weren't around, and the play aunt spent time with them. So the author's family did the caregiving, which could justify the inheritance. Also, the author didn't expect payment for the chores, so maybe the inheritance is a gesture of gratitude.\n\nHowever, the relatives are upset and might contest the will. If the author is in a position where they can share some of the inheritance to prevent legal issues, maybe they should consider that. But the author isn't obligated to. The key here is that the will was the play aunt's choice. Unless there's evidence of coercion or undue influence, the author has a right to the inheritance. The annoyance at the relatives' involvement is understandable, especially since they weren't present when the play aunt needed care.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They have a valid claim through the will, and the relatives not being involved in the aunt's life could mean she had the right to leave her assets as she wished. The answer is B.\n"
