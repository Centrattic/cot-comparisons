When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The situation is about whether the author is in the wrong for accepting an inheritance from a \"play aunt,\" even though the aunt's relatives are upset because they weren't close and didn't visit much. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the details. The author and their actual aunt did chores for the play aunt for years, like shoveling snow and cutting grass. The play aunt wasn't a blood relative but was close to the actual aunt. She left her property and money to the author through the executor, her actual aunt. The relatives are upset and might contest the will, but the author feels justified because the relatives weren't around much.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks they are, but I need to assess based on the situation. \n\nLegally, if the will is valid and the play aunt intended to leave everything to the author, then the author has a right to it. The relatives contesting might not have a strong legal standing if they weren't close and the will is properly executed. \n\nMorally, it's trickier. The author didn't expect compensation for the chores, but the play aunt left them the inheritance as a gesture of gratitude. The relatives might feel slighted, but they weren't involved in the aunt's life as much. The author's reasoning is that they were present during holidays and the relatives weren't. \n\nThe key points are the validity of the will and the intentions of the play aunt. Since the relatives haven't approached the author directly and the executor (actual aunt) is okay with the author keeping it, it's likely that the play aunt's wishes were clear. \n\nSo, legally and morally, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
