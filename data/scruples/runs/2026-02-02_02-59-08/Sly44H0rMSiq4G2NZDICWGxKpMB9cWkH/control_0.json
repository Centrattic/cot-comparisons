When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong for not giving up an inheritance they received from their \"play aunt.\" Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that they and their actual aunt took care of the play aunt by doing chores like shoveling snow and mowing the lawn. They did this because the play aunt was nice to them as a kid and helped their kids with college letters. The play aunt isn't related by blood, but they were close. The actual aunt is the executor and told the author they were left the property and money. The play aunt's relatives, who weren't close, are upset and might contest the will. The author feels annoyed that these relatives are involved now and isn't giving them anything except family pictures. The husband supports the author's decision.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is wrong for following the play aunt's wishes. Let's consider the key points. The play aunt explicitly left everything to the author, so legally, unless the relatives can contest the will successfully, the author is within their rights. The author didn't expect compensation initially but the aunt chose to leave them the inheritance. The relatives weren't close, so their claim might not be strong. However, maybe there's an expectation of sharing in some way. But the author isn't being unkind by not giving them money; they are just respecting the will. The husband's support suggests it's a personal decision.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, the author isn't in the wrong because the will is clear. Ethically, it's more nuanced. The author had a close relationship with the play aunt, who didn't have kids. The relatives weren't involved, so the author might feel they have a stronger claim. The play aunt's wishes should be respected unless there's a legal challenge. Since the relatives haven't approached the author directly, their intent to contest might not hold up. The author's annoyance is understandable given the circumstances. So, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
