When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the scenario) is in the wrong for not giving up an inheritance they received. Let's break down the details.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author had a \"play aunt,\" not a blood relative. They and their actual aunt took care of the play aunt by doing chores like shoveling snow and mowing the lawn. The author didn't expect payment but saw it as a favor since the play aunt was nice to them as a kid and helped their kids. The play aunt left her estate to the author through her actual aunt, who is the executor. The relatives of the play aunt are upset and might contest the will, but they haven't been close for years. The author is considering keeping everything, feeling annoyed that the relatives are now involved, and their husband says it's up to them.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong by obeying the will and keeping the inheritance. To figure this out, I need to consider legal and moral aspects.\n\nLegally, if the will was properly executed and the relatives haven't successfully contested it, the author is within their rights to keep the inheritance. The executor (the actual aunt) is handling the estate, so unless there's a legal challenge that gets the will thrown out, the author has a legal claim to the inheritance.\n\nMoral aspects are trickier. The author had a long-term relationship with the play aunt, providing care and support. The relatives were not close, as stated. The author didn't expect anything in return initially. The relatives are now upset, but their lack of involvement over the years might be a factor in the moral judgment. The author might feel that their contribution and relationship justify the inheritance. However, some might argue that the relatives have a claim as family and that the author took advantage of the situation. But considering the play aunt's wishes and the effort the author put in, there's a moral argument for the author keeping the inheritance.\n\nThe key points here are: the will's validity, the actual relationship between the parties, and the relatives' history of involvement. If the will is valid and the relatives weren't involved, the author isn't in the wrong. If the relatives can contest the will successfully, then the author might have to return it, but that's a legal matter, not a moral one. The author's actions based on the will's instructions and their long-term care make them not in the wrong morally. The answer should be B, No.\n"
