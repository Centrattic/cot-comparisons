When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The question is whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for not giving up an inheritance they received from a play aunt. The author and their family helped the play aunt with chores for years, and the play aunt left her estate to them. The relatives are upset and might contest the will. The author's own aunt is the executor and thinks they should keep it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. If the will was properly executed, then the author has a legal right to the inheritance. The relatives talking about contesting might not be valid if there's no legal basis. So legally, the author is probably okay.\n\nThen there's the moral side. The author helped the play aunt for years, and the aunt had no children. The relatives weren't close, so maybe the author's family was more involved. The author isn't obligated to share the inheritance unless legally required. However, if the relatives do contest and there's a legal challenge, the author might have to go through that, but that's separate from being in the wrong morally.\n\nThe author feels annoyed that the relatives are now involved. They provided care and support, so it's reasonable they were named in the will. The husband's advice is that it's up to the author, which suggests that socially, there's no expectation to share unless the author chooses to. \n\nSo, considering both legal and moral aspects, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They followed the play aunt's wishes, which were valid if the will is legitimate. The relatives' potential contest doesn't change the author's right to the inheritance. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
