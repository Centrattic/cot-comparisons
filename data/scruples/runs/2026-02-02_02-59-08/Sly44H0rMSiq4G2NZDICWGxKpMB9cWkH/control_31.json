When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not giving up the inheritance they received from their \"play aunt.\" Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the context: The author and their actual aunt took care of the play aunt for years, doing chores and helping out. The play aunt wasn't related by blood but was close to the actual aunt. The play aunt left her property and money to the author through her will, which was handled by the actual aunt as the executor. The play aunt's relatives are upset and might contest the will, but they haven't contacted the author directly. The author feels annoyed because the relatives weren't around and the play aunt spent time with them instead.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong by taking the inheritance as per the will. The options are A (yes) or B (no).\n\nLegally, if the will is valid and the author is named as the beneficiary, then they have the right to inherit. The relatives' contesting the will would depend on the validity of the will and any legal grounds they might have, like undue influence or lack of capacity. But the author isn't mentioned as doing anything to influence the will. The author's actions were caring for the aunt, which seems to have been appreciated.\n\nMorally, the author did a lot for the play aunt without expecting anything in return. The relatives weren't close, so the play aunt's decision to leave everything to the author might be seen as a way to thank them. The author isn't obligated to give anything to the relatives unless there's a legal requirement, which I don't think there is here. The author's husband also says the decision is up to them, which adds to the personal autonomy aspect.\n\nI think the key points are the validity of the will and the author's intent. Since the author didn't do anything to manipulate the will and the play aunt made her own choice, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
