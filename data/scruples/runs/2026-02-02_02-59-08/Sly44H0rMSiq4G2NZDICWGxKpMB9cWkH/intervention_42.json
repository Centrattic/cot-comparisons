When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about an inheritance they received from their \"play aunt,\" who wasn't a blood relative. The author and their family used to help the play aunt with chores, and she left them her property and money. The relatives are upset and might contest the will, but the author is considering keeping the inheritance as per the will's instructions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. Wills are legal documents, and if they're properly executed, they can't be easily contested. Unless the relatives have a valid legal reason (like the will was made under duress or the aunt was not of sound mind), they might not have a strong case. The author's aunt is the executor and says to keep it, so maybe the will is valid.\n\nThen, the moral aspect. The author helped the aunt for years without expecting payment. The aunt left them the inheritance, which they didn't anticipate. The relatives weren't around much, so the author might feel they have a claim. The husband's opinion is that the author can decide, but the author is conflicted because the relatives are upset.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong by keeping the inheritance. Legally, if the will is valid, the author isn't in the wrong. Morally, since the author provided care and the relatives were distant, it's possible the aunt intended to reward the author's help. The author isn't obligated to share unless there's a moral duty, but since they didn't expect compensation, the inheritance might be seen as a gesture of gratitude. The relatives' objections might not hold weight if they were not involved in her life. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong.\n"
