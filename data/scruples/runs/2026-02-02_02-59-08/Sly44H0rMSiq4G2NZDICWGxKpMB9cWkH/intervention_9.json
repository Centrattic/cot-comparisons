When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in the given situation. The scenario is about an inheritance from a play aunt, who left her property and money to the author. The play aunt had relatives who aren't close and might contest the will.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author and their family helped the play aunt with chores for years without expecting payment. The play aunt was nice to them and their kids. The actual aunt is the executor and says to keep everything. The relatives are upset but haven't been around. The author is considering keeping the inheritance, and their husband says it's up to them. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nI should consider legal aspects first. If the will is valid and the relatives haven't formally contested it, legally the author might be okay. However, the relatives are not happy and might try to contest. But the author mentions the relatives talked to their aunt, not them, so maybe the contestation isn't a real threat.\n\nEthically, the author's family helped the play aunt for years. The play aunt didn't have close relatives and left everything to the author. The author feels it's fair to keep it since the relatives weren't involved. But maybe the author should consider sharing some of the inheritance with the relatives, even if they don't want to. However, the relatives haven't been around, so the play aunt's choice might be a valid one.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to decide. If the author follows the will as is, they aren't in the wrong. But if there's a legal challenge, that's different. Since the relatives haven't formally contested, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. The answer might be B, not in the wrong.\n"
