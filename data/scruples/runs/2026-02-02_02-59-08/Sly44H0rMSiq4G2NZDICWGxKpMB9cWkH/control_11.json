When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not giving up an inheritance. The scenario is that the author's \"play aunt\" left her property and money to the author. The play aunt didn't have kids, and the author and their actual aunt helped her with chores. The relatives are upset and might contest the will, but they weren't close.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. Since the will was made by the play aunt and she chose the author, as long as the will is valid and properly executed, the author has a legal right to the inheritance. The relatives contesting would depend on their legal standing and whether the will was properly made. If the will was valid, the author isn't legally in the wrong.\n\nEthically, the author helped the play aunt for years, and the aunt appreciated them enough to leave her inheritance. The relatives weren't around, so the author might feel justified in keeping it. However, there's a moral consideration about fairness to the relatives, even if they weren't present. The author's husband says it's up to them, which suggests no pressure from the spouse.\n\nThe key points are the validity of the will, the intentions of the deceased, and the actions of the author. The author didn't expect compensation for their help but was left the inheritance. The play aunt had the right to decide who gets her assets. The relatives' potential contest might not hold up if the will is valid.\n\nSo, legally and ethically, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
