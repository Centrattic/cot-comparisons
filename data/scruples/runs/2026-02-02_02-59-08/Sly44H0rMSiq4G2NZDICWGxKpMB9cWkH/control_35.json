When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not forgoing an inheritance. Let me break down the situation.\n\nSo, the author is part of a family where they and their actual aunt took care of their \"play aunt,\" who wasn't a blood relative. They did chores like shoveling and mowing, which were extra work but not too much. The play aunt left her property and money to the author through their actual aunt, who's the executor. The play aunt's relatives are upset and might contest the will. The author feels annoyed because the relatives weren't around, and the author is considering keeping the inheritance.\n\nFirst, legally, if the will is valid, the author has a right to the inheritance. The play aunt had the right to leave her assets to whomever she wanted. The relatives might contest it, but if they weren't close, their claim might not hold up. The author isn't legally obligated to give up the inheritance. \n\nMorally, the author feels they deserve it because of the care provided. The play aunt was nice to them as a kid and helped their kids. The author and their actual aunt took responsibility for the play aunt when others didn't. The relatives weren't around, so maybe it's fair the play aunt chose to reward those who supported her.\n\nThe husband says it's up to the author. The author isn't in a position where they have to give up the inheritance. They might feel conflicted, but based on the situation, they aren't in the wrong. The key points are the play aunt's intent, the lack of involvement from the relatives, and the care provided. So the answer should be B.\n"
