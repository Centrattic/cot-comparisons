When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the given scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves an inheritance from a \"play aunt\" who wasn't a blood relative. The key points are that the author and their actual aunt did maintenance work for the play aunt over the years, and the play aunt left her estate to the author. The play aunt's relatives are upset and considering contesting the will.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. If the will was properly drawn up and the play aunt had the legal capacity to make such a bequest, then legally the author has the right to the inheritance. The relatives haven't been involved much, so their claim might not hold up legally unless they can prove the will is invalid, which is a high bar. So legally, the author is probably in the right.\n\nThen, the moral or ethical side. The author did help out the play aunt, though they weren't close relatives. The author feels they didn't expect compensation, but the play aunt left them everything. The relatives are upset because they weren't around much. The author is annoyed by their involvement now. The husband says it's up to the author to decide, but the question is whether keeping the inheritance makes the author an \"asshole.\"\n\nSome might argue that the author should share some of the inheritance since the play aunt had relatives. Others might say the author has a valid claim because they were the ones providing care and the play aunt chose to leave it to them. The author isn't obligated to share unless there's a legal challenge. The key here is the play aunt's intent. If she made the will herself and clearly intended to leave it to the author, then ethically it's her choice. The author isn't in the wrong for honoring the will's terms.\n\nAlso, considering the effort the author and their family put in, perhaps the play aunt saw them as family and wanted to reward that. The relatives not being around might mean they didn't contribute, so the author isn't in the wrong for keeping the inheritance. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
