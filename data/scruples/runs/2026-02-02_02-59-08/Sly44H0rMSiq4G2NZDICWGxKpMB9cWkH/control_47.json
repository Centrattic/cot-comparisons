When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong regarding an inheritance from their \"play aunt.\" The aunt left her property and money to the author, but her relatives are upset and might contest the will. The author is considering keeping everything as per the will and feels annoyed because the relatives were absent for years.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the legal aspect. If the will is valid and properly executed, the author has the right to inherit as specified. The relatives contesting the will would need to prove it was invalid, perhaps due to undue influence, lack of capacity, or not meeting the formalities. But the question here is about moral responsibility, not just legal.\n\nThe author helped the play aunt by doing chores, which was reciprocated with kindness. The relatives weren't close, as they didn't visit much. The author's actual aunt is the executor, and she told them to keep everything. The husband says it's up to the author. The author feels they aren't in the wrong because the relatives weren't there for the play aunt.\n\nMorally, if someone has a valid will that disinherits relatives, but those relatives weren't close and the person in the will had a closer relationship, it's more about the deceased's wishes. The relatives might not have a strong moral claim if they weren't present in the play aunt's life. The author's contribution to the play aunt's well-being could be seen as a reason for the inheritance.\n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They followed the will's instructions and have a history of support. Unless the will was made under questionable circumstances, the author is within their rights. The relatives' potential contest is a legal matter, but morally, the author isn't at fault here. The answer should be B.\n"
