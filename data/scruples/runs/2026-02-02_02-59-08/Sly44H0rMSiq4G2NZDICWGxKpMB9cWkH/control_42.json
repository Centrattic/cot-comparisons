When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for not giving up the inheritance from the \"play aunt.\" \n\nFirst, the situation: The play aunt wasn't a blood relative, but the author, along with their actual aunt, helped her with chores. The author didn't expect payment for this help. Now, the play aunt left her property and money to the author, and her relatives are upset, possibly contesting the will. The author is considering keeping the inheritance.\n\nKey points to consider:\n1. The will was written by the play aunt, so her wishes are clear. The author is following her stated intent, which is the core of estate distribution.\n2. The author's family (actual aunt) is the executor and supports keeping the inheritance. The play aunt's relatives weren't close, didn't visit much, and the author's family provided care. The author is justified in feeling they were the primary support system.\n3. Legally, unless the will is contested successfully (which would depend on legal standards and maybe the relatives' relationship to her), the author has the right to the inheritance. The relatives' threat to contest might not hold up if there's no legal basis.\n4. Morally, the author isn't obligated to share unless there's a prior agreement. The author's actions align with the play aunt's wishes and the support they provided over the years.\n\nPossible counterarguments: The relatives might feel entitled, but their lack of involvement during the play aunt's life weakens their claim. The author isn't being greedy; they're honoring the will and their own good deeds.\n\nSo, the answer is B (Not in the wrong). The author is respecting the will, their relationship with the play aunt, and the support they provided. The relatives' discontent doesn't negate the author's right to the inheritance as per the will.\n"
