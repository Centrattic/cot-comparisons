When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person in the \"WIBTA\" scenario) is in the wrong for not giving up the inheritance they received. \n\nFirst, the facts: The author helped an aunt (not related by blood) with chores, and in return, the aunt left her estate to them. The actual aunt is the executor and told the author to keep it. The blood relatives are upset and might contest the will, but they weren't close to the aunt for years. The author feels annoyed that the relatives are involved now and isn't planning to give them anything.\n\nThe key points here are the legal and moral aspects. Legally, if the will is valid and the author is the rightful heir, then they aren't in the wrong. The relatives contesting the will would need to prove it's invalid. The author's husband says it's their decision, which supports their right to keep it. \n\nMoral-wise, the author has a history of helping the aunt, who was close to them and their family. The relatives were distant, so the aunt's choice might be seen as fair. The author isn't obligated to share the inheritance unless there's a legal obligation. \n\nThe author's annoyance is understandable since they contributed to the aunt's care. The relatives not being around doesn't justify their claims. So, the author is not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
