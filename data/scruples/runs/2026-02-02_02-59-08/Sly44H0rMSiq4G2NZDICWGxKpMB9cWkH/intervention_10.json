When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this situation. The person is asking if they're an asshole for not giving up an inheritance from their \"play aunt.\" The play aunt wasn't a blood relative, and the author's actual aunt was her executor. The play aunt left her property and money to the author. The play aunt's relatives aren't close, but they're upset and considering contesting the will.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. If the will is valid and the executor (the actual aunt) confirmed the wishes, then legally, the author is entitled to the inheritance. The relatives might not have a legal standing to contest it if they were distant and not mentioned in the will. So the author isn't breaking any laws by accepting the inheritance.\n\nMorally, the question is trickier. The play aunt had a relationship with the author's family. They helped her with chores, and she was nice to them as a child. The relatives weren't around, so maybe the play aunt felt grateful towards the author's family. The author's husband says it's their choice, which suggests that the husband isn't pressuring them to give anything up.\n\nThe author is annoyed that the relatives are now involved after not being around. That annoyance is valid because the play aunt's preferences were clear through her will. The author isn't obligated to share the inheritance unless there's a legal obligation. Since the relatives haven't contacted the author directly and the will is set, the author isn't in the wrong for following the deceased's wishes. The relatives' potential contest might not hold up, especially if the will is properly executed. \n\nIn this case, the author is acting on the play aunt's wishes as expressed in her will. They didn't expect compensation initially, but the inheritance is a gift from the play aunt. The author isn't doing anything wrong legally or morally by accepting it, given the circumstances described. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
