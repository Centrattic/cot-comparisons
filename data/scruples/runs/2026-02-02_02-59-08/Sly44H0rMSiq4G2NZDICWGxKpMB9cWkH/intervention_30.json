When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not giving up the inheritance. The situation is that the author's \"play aunt\" left her estate to them, and the real relatives are upset but haven't been around.\n\nFirst, the author and their family helped the play aunt with tasks like snow shoveling and yard work. They mention it wasn't a lot of extra work since they were nearby. The play aunt didn't pay them but was nice to the author as a kid and helped their kids with college stuff. The actual aunt is the executor and says the author should keep it. The relatives are considering contesting the will but haven't approached the author directly.\n\nThe author feels annoyed that the relatives are involved now, especially since they weren't there for the play aunt. The husband says it's their decision to give anything to the relatives. The author is considering keeping the inheritance as per the will.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, the will is legally valid. The relatives haven't officially contested it, and the author didn't do anything to interfere with the will. They were close to the play aunt, and she chose to leave her assets to them. The author's actions (helping out) were out of generosity, not expecting payment. Since the will is clear, the author isn't obligated to give anything unless they choose to. The relatives' potential contest is their own issue, but unless they win, the author has a right to the inheritance. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
