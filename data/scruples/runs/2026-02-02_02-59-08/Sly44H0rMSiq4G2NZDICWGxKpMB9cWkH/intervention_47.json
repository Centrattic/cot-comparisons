When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about an inheritance from a \"play aunt,\" who isn't a blood relative. The person (let's call them the author) and their actual aunt helped the play aunt with tasks like shoveling snow and cutting grass over the years. The author didn't expect compensation because the play aunt was nice to them as a kid and helped their children. Now, the play aunt's relatives are unhappy about the will leaving the estate to the author and might contest it. The author is considering keeping everything, while their husband says it's up to them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. If the play aunt legally left the inheritance to the author through her will, then the author is entitled to it unless the will is successfully contested in court. Since the relatives haven't come to the author directly, just talked to the executor (the actual aunt), the author might be within their rights to follow the will as written. \n\nThen there's the moral or ethical side. The author and their family provided care and support to the play aunt, which she appreciated enough to include them in her will. The relatives weren't around much, so the author might feel that their long-term support justifies the inheritance. However, the author is now facing potential contestation, which could lead to legal complications. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong if they don't give up the inheritance. The play aunt's relatives might argue that they have a rightful claim, especially if they are next of kin. But if the will is valid and the relatives didn't have a close relationship, the author could feel they're being unfairly burdened. \n\nIn many jurisdictions, if the will is properly executed, the relatives might not have a strong case unless there's evidence of undue influence or the will was made under suspicious circumstances. The author's actions of helping out seem genuine and not exploitative. The play aunt chose to leave her assets to someone she felt cared for her. \n\nSo, from a legal standpoint, the author isn't in the wrong as long as they follow the will's instructions. Ethically, it's more nuanced, but if the play aunt intended to give the inheritance to them, the author isn't wrong for honoring that. The relatives' potential contest might not hold up if the will is valid. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
