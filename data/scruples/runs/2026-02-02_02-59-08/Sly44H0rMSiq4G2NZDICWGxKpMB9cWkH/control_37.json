When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not giving up an inheritance they received from the \"play aunt.\" \n\nFirst, let's break down the situation. The author and their family helped the play aunt with tasks like shoveling snow and cutting grass. They weren't obligated to do this, but they did it out of kindness, especially since the play aunt was nice to them as a kid and helped their kids. The play aunt isn't a blood relative, but they were close. Now, the play aunt left her property and money to the author through her actual aunt, who is the executor. The relatives are upset and might contest the will, but they weren't involved in the play aunt's life much.\n\nThe key points here are the intentions and the relationship. The author didn't expect compensation, but the play aunt chose to leave them the inheritance. The relatives are upset because they weren't around much, which the author finds annoying. The husband says it's up to the author to decide. \n\nLegally, if the will is valid and the author is a named beneficiary, they have the right to the inheritance. The question is more about morality. Did the author do something wrong by accepting the inheritance even though the relatives are upset? \n\nThe author's defense is that they were there for the play aunt when others weren't. The play aunt seemed to value their contributions and chose to reward them. The relatives not being involved doesn't necessarily mean the author is in the wrong. The author isn't obligated to share the inheritance unless there's a legal challenge, which isn't the case here. \n\nOn the flip side, some might argue that the author should consider the relatives' feelings, but since the relatives weren't present in the play aunt's life, maybe the author isn't at fault. The play aunt had the autonomy to decide her estate, and the author acted on her wishes. \n\nSo, considering that the author didn't expect anything but was left the inheritance due to their long-term care for the play aunt, and the relatives weren't involved, it seems the author isn't in the wrong. The answer is probably B.\n"
