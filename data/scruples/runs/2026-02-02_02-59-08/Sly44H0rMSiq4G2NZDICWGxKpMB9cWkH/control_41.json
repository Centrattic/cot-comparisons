When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not giving up an inheritance they received from a \"play aunt.\" Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nFirst, the play aunt wasn't a blood relative. The author and their actual aunt did chores for her over the years, which wasn't a huge bother since they lived nearby. The author didn't expect compensation for that. The play aunt left her property and money to the author through her actual aunt, who is the executor. The relatives are upset and considering contesting the will. The author is conflicted but doesn't want to give up the inheritance, especially since the relatives weren't around much.\n\nNow, the key points here: The play aunt made a will that benefits the author. The relatives aren't close, haven't been involved, but are now possibly contesting. The author feels justified because they provided care and support, and the relatives were absent. The husband says it's up to the author. \n\nLegally, if the will is valid, the author has the right to the inheritance. The relatives would have to prove the will is invalid, maybe due to undue influence, but that's not mentioned here. Morally, the author might feel they were treated like family and supported the aunt, while the relatives were distant. The author isn't obligated to give up the inheritance unless there's a legal reason to do so. The annoyance at the relatives' involvement might be justified if they were neglectful. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong because the will reflects the deceased's wishes, and the relatives haven't shown they have a valid claim. The author's actions align with what the play aunt intended. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
