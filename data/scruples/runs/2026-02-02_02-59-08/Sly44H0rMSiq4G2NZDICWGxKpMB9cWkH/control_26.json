When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for not giving up the inheritance from the \"play aunt.\" Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the play aunt wasn't a blood relative. The author and their actual aunt helped her with chores like snow shoveling and mowing, which wasn't much extra work since they lived nearby. The author didn't expect any payment for this, as the aunt was kind and helped with things like college letters for the author's kids. \n\nThe play aunt's relatives are upset because they weren't close and didn't visit her much. The actual aunt, who is the executor, says they should keep everything. The play aunt left her property and money to them, and the relatives might contest the will. The author is annoyed because the relatives are now coming forward after not being around for years.\n\nThe key points here are the intent of the deceased (the play aunt's will) and the actions of the relatives. The author wasn't expecting compensation for the help, and the will explicitly left everything to them. The relatives not being close or involved before might be a factor in whether they have a valid claim. Since the author is following the will's instructions, unless there's a legal reason to contest (like undue influence or lack of capacity), it's about respecting the deceased's wishes. The author isn't obligated to give up what was legally left to them just because the relatives are upset. So the answer might be B, not in the wrong.\n"
