When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for not giving up an inheritance they received from their \"play aunt,\" who wasn't a blood relative. The author did some chores for the aunt over the years and the actual aunt, and now the play aunt left them her estate. The relatives are upset and might contest the will. The author is annoyed they're involved now when they weren't around before.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. If the will was properly executed and the author is a valid heir, then legally, they aren't in the wrong. The relatives contesting the will would need legal grounds, like proving the will was made under undue influence, not properly witnessed, or if the testator was of unsound mind. Since the author mentions the relatives haven't spoken to her directly, maybe the will stands legally.\n\nEmotionally, the author might feel justified because they provided care and support over the years. The play aunt considered them part of the family, so it's possible that's why she left the inheritance. The relatives weren't present, so their sudden claim could be seen as opportunistic. The author's husband supports their right to decide, which adds to the idea that it's not wrong.\n\nBut there's also the social aspect. Even if legal, the author might face criticism for not sharing, especially if the relatives were family. However, given the context that the relatives weren't involved, the author's stance is more defensible. The key factors are the will's validity and the family's lack of prior involvement. So, the answer would likely be B, not in the wrong.\n"
