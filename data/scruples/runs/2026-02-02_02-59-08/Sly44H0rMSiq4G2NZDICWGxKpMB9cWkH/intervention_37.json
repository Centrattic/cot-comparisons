When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the WIBTA scenario is in the wrong. The author is asking if they'd be an asshole for keeping an inheritance from a \"play aunt\" instead of sharing it with her relatives.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The play aunt isn't a blood relation. The author and their actual aunt took care of her, doing chores, and the play aunt left everything to the author's real aunt, who then passed it on. The play aunt's relatives are upset and might contest the will. The author is annoyed because they feel the relatives weren't around, and they provided care.\n\nSo, the key points are: the inheritance was left by the play aunt according to her wishes, the executor (the author's aunt) says to keep it, the relatives are contesting but haven't contacted the author. The author is considering keeping it because they provided care, and the relatives were distant.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, if the will is valid and the executor is handling it properly, the author has a right to the inheritance. But morally, the question is whether the author is being an asshole by not sharing with the relatives. The relatives might have legal claims, but the author feels justified because they were the ones providing care and support. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that the relatives weren't present, so the inheritance should go to those who were there for the play aunt. The husband says it's up to the author. WIBTA threads often consider societal norms and expectations. In many cases, if someone is named in a will, they're expected to honor it unless there's a legal challenge. However, if the relatives are contesting, the author might face legal trouble if they don't share if the will is found invalid. \n\nBut the author might be in the right if the will is valid. The problem is that the relatives are upset, but the author isn't obligated to give them anything. However, if the relatives contest the will successfully, the author might lose the inheritance. But the question is about being an asshole, not legal consequences. \n\nThe author might be seen as selfish if they take everything without considering the relatives' potential claims, but if the will is legally sound, then they might not be in the wrong. It's a bit of a gray area. The answer could depend on whether the author's actions align with the deceased's intentions. The play aunt wanted her property to go to the author, so honoring that might be right. The relatives' contestation might be a legal matter, but morally, the author's annoyance is understandable given their history with the play aunt.\n\nI think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong. They are following the play aunt's wishes, and the relatives' contestation is a separate legal issue. The author isn't obligated to share unless the will is invalidated. The care they provided justifies their position, and they're being reasonable by considering giving family pictures but not the inheritance. So, B makes sense.\n"
