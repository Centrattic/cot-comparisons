When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author is in the wrong by keeping an inheritance from the \"play aunt.\" The key points are the relationships and the context of the inheritance.\n\nFirst, the play aunt isn't a blood relative. The author and their actual aunt took care of her by doing chores like snow shoveling and lawn work. The author didn't expect payment for this, which is understandable since they were close and the tasks weren't too burdensome. The play aunt's relatives are upset because they weren't close and didn't visit much. The actual aunt, as the executor, informed the author that they were named in the will. The relatives might contest the will, but they haven't contacted the author directly yet.\n\nThe author feels annoyed that the relatives are involved now, given that they weren't around when the play aunt needed help. The husband says it's up to the author to decide. The question is whether the author is wrong to keep the inheritance as per the will.\n\nIn terms of legal perspective, if the will is valid, the author has the right to the inheritance. The play aunt had the right to leave her property to whomever she wanted. The relatives might not have a strong legal case if they can't prove undue influence or lack of testamentary capacity. However, the ethical aspect is different. The author might feel they deserve it because of their care, but the relatives might feel slighted. However, since the relatives weren't involved in the play aunt's daily life, the author's case is stronger. The author isn't legally obligated to share, and ethically, since they provided care and the will is clear, they're probably not in the wrong. The answer is B.\n"
