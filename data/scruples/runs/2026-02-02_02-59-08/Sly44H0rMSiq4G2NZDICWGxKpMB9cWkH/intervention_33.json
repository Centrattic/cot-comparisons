When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves an inheritance from a \"play aunt,\" who was not a blood relative. The person in question, the author, was given the inheritance by the play aunt through their actual aunt, the executor. The relatives of the play aunt are upset and might contest the will, but the author is considering keeping the inheritance.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. Legally, if the will was properly executed and the author is a named beneficiary, then they have a right to the inheritance. The fact that the relatives aren't close and weren't around suggests that the play aunt may have had valid reasons for her choice. The author and their family provided care and support over the years, which the play aunt might have appreciated and wanted to reward.\n\nEthically, the author isn't obligated to share the inheritance unless they feel a moral duty. The play aunt's relatives haven't contributed to her care, so their claim might be weaker. However, contesting the will could be possible if they believe the will was made under undue influence or if there were legal issues, but the author mentions the relatives haven't spoken directly to them, which might indicate they're not in a strong position legally.\n\nThe author's annoyance at the relatives getting involved despite not being present is understandable. They provided practical help and had a good relationship with the play aunt. The husband's advice to decide on their own suggests that the decision is personal.\n\nI think the key points are the legal validity of the will, the contribution of the author's family, and the lack of involvement from the relatives. If the will is valid, the author isn't in the wrong for accepting it. The relatives' potential contest is a separate issue, but unless there's legal grounds, the author isn't at fault. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
