When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person in the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author receiving an inheritance from a \"play aunt\" who they helped with chores over the years. The actual aunt is the executor and wants the author to keep everything, but the play aunt's relatives are upset because they weren't close but now might contest the will. The author is annoyed and considering keeping the inheritance.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The author and their family helped the play aunt with tasks, but the author didn't expect compensation. The play aunt left her estate to the author, which is a significant amount, not just a small inheritance. The relatives are not close and haven't been involved, but they're now upset. The author is considering keeping the inheritance as per the will.\n\nNow, the question is about moral responsibility. The author isn't legally in the wrong because the will is valid, and the author is a beneficiary. But morally, is it wrong to take the inheritance when there are relatives who might contest it? The author's argument is that they helped the play aunt and were close, whereas the relatives weren't involved. However, the relatives might feel entitled, even if they weren't present.\n\nThe author's husband says it's up to them to decide. The author is conflicted because they might face challenges from the relatives. If the relatives contest the will, the author might end up in a legal battle, but that's a separate issue from being in the wrong morally.\n\nThe user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong, but I need to consider both sides. The author didn't expect to receive anything for helping the play aunt. The play aunt's wishes are clear in the will. The relatives not being close could mean they don't have a strong claim. However, there's a sense that the author is benefiting from a bequest that might not be fair to the relatives, especially if they weren't aware of the arrangement. \n\nBut since the author wasn't expecting anything and the play aunt made a deliberate choice to leave the estate to them, it's more about respecting the deceased's wishes. The author's annoyance at the relatives' involvement seems to stem from the fact that they weren't part of the play aunt's life. So, in that context, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because the will reflects the play aunt's intentions. The relatives contesting is their own decision, not the author's fault for accepting the inheritance.\n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong. They followed the will's instructions, and the relatives' potential contest is a separate matter. The author's actions are justified based on the play aunt's expressed wishes and the lack of connection from the relatives.\n"
