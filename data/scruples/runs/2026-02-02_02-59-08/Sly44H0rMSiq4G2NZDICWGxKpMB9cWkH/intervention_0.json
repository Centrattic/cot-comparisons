When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe author helped their play aunt with tasks like shoveling snow and cutting grass, which wasn't too much extra work since they lived nearby. The play aunt was nice to them as a kid and helped their kids with college stuff. The actual aunt is the executor and told the author they were left everything in the will. The relatives of the play aunt are upset and might contest the will, but they haven't been close for years. The author is annoyed by their involvement and doesn't want to give them the inheritance. The husband says it's up to them. The author is wondering if they're being an asshole by keeping the inheritance as per the will.\n\nFirst, I should consider the legal aspect. The will is valid, and the author is the rightful heir unless the relatives successfully contest it. But since the relatives aren't close and the author was the main person caring for the play aunt, maybe the will was a legitimate expression of her wishes.\n\nEthically, the author was doing favors without expecting payment. The play aunt chose to leave her assets to them, which might be a gesture of gratitude. The relatives not being close could mean they don't have a strong claim. However, the author might feel conflicted if they think the relatives are entitled, even if they weren't present.\n\nAnother angle: the author isn't obligated to share the inheritance. The will is clear, and the author isn't the one who wrote it. The actual aunt as the executor is advising them to keep it. The relatives contesting might not have a solid legal basis if they weren't close and the play aunt had a will in place.\n\nBut maybe the author's annoyance at the relatives' involvement could influence their decision. If the author feels they were wronged by the relatives not being there, but the play aunt chose them, the author is following the deceased's wishes. However, if the author feels they deserve the inheritance because of the help they provided, that's another point.\n\nIn the end, if the author is following the will as intended by the deceased, and the relatives' claims are weak, then the author isn't in the wrong. The key points are the will's validity, the deceased's intent, and the lack of close ties from the relatives. So I think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
