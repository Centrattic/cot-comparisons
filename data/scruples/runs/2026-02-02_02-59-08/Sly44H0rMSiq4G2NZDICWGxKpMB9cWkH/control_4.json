When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author is being asked whether they would be in the wrong if they kept an inheritance from their \"play aunt.\" The aunt wasn't a blood relative, and the author, along with their actual aunt, helped take care of the play aunt by doing chores like shoveling snow and mowing the lawn. The author didn't expect any money for this, as the play aunt was kind to them as a kid and helped with their kids' college letters.\n\nNow, the play aunt left her estate\u2014home, car, life insurance\u2014to the author. The actual aunt, who's the executor, thinks the author should keep it. However, the play aunt's relatives, who weren't close, are upset and might contest the will. The author is annoyed these relatives are involved now, especially since the play aunt spent time with them instead. The husband says it's up to the author, but they're unsure if they're in the wrong by just taking the inheritance.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal aspects. Since the actual aunt is the executor and the will is valid (assuming it's properly executed), the author is legally entitled to the inheritance. The relatives contesting might not hold up if there's no valid legal grounds. However, the question isn't just about legality but also about moral or social wrongness. \n\nMoral considerations: The author and their family provided care and support to the play aunt over the years. The play aunt chose to leave her assets to them, which could be seen as a gesture of gratitude. The relatives were distant and didn't contribute to her care. From a moral standpoint, the author might not be in the wrong because the play aunt's wishes were honored, and the author had a closer relationship and provided more support.\n\nSocial perspective: If the author gives the inheritance to the relatives, it might be seen as fair, but if they keep it, others might argue they're entitled since the play aunt intended it. However, since the relatives were not involved, the author might feel justified. The key is whether the author is being selfish or honoring someone's wishes. The fact that the will was made by the deceased and the relatives are contesting it without a strong reason could support the author's position.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They followed the deceased's wishes, provided care, and the relatives were distant. The answer should be B (No).\n"
