When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about an inheritance from a \"play aunt\" who isn't a blood relative. The key points are that the author and their actual aunt did small chores for the play aunt over the years, and now the play aunt left her estate to the author. The relatives are upset and might contest the will.\n\nFirst, the play aunt isn't related by blood. The author helped out with tasks, but didn't expect payment. The will was made by the play aunt, naming the author as the beneficiary. The relatives are not close and haven't been involved much. The question is whether the author is wrong to keep the inheritance as per the will.\n\nInheritance laws generally honor the will's terms unless there's a legal reason to challenge it. If the will was properly executed, the relatives would need a valid legal basis to contest it. The author isn't in a position to have been part of that contest; their duty is to follow the will unless legally required otherwise. The author's contribution to the play aunt's care might be a moral argument, but legally, the will is the deciding factor. The author isn't in the wrong for following the deceased's wishes unless there's fraud or undue influence involved, which isn't mentioned here. So the answer is likely B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
