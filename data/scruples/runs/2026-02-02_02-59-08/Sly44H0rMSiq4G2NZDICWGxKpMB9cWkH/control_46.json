When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about an inheritance. The author is called the \"play aunt\" by the deceased, but they're not blood-related. The actual aunt and the play aunt were friends, and the author and their family helped out with tasks like snow shoveling and gardening for the play aunt. They didn't expect anything in return because the play aunt was nice to them as a kid and helped with college stuff.\n\nNow, the play aunt left her property and money to the author through the actual aunt, who is the executor. The relatives are upset and might contest the will. The author is annoyed because they weren't involved in the conversation about contesting the will and feels the relatives didn't take care of the play aunt for years, while their family did. The husband says it's up to the author to decide if they want to give the relatives anything. The question is whether the author is in the wrong if they keep the inheritance.\n\nFirst, legally, if the will is valid, the author is the rightful heir. The play aunt had the right to leave her assets to whomever she wanted. The relatives might contest it, but if the will is legally sound, their chances of success might be low. The author's family provided care and support, which the play aunt appreciated. The play aunt's relatives weren't close, so the author's claim could be justified based on the care given.\n\nMoral-wise, the author might feel they deserve the inheritance because they helped out. The relatives not being involved might make the author feel they aren't entitled. However, others might argue that the relatives could still have a claim, especially if they have legal rights. But since the play aunt chose to leave it to the author, it's her final decision.\n\nThe husband's advice that it's up to the author to decide is important. The author has the autonomy to choose. The key points are the validity of the will and the intent of the deceased. If the play aunt genuinely wanted the author to have everything, then the author isn't in the wrong for following her wishes. The relatives' potential contesting is their issue, not the author's responsibility unless there's a legal obligation to share, which there doesn't seem to be.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. They were given the inheritance as per the play aunt's wishes, and the relatives' actions are their own. The author's help over the years justifies their claim, and they aren't obligated to give anything to the relatives unless ordered by a court. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
