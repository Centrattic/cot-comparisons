When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the person in the scenario is in the wrong for not giving up an inheritance they received.\n\nFirst, the situation: The person's \"play aunt,\" who isn't a blood relative, passed away. They and their actual aunt took care of her, doing chores like shoveling and mowing. The actual aunt is the executor and told them they were left the inheritance. The play aunt's relatives are upset and might contest the will. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for keeping the inheritance as per the will.\n\nKey points to consider:\n\n1. **Intent of the Deceased**: The play aunt's will explicitly left everything to the author. If the will is valid, the author is entitled to the inheritance. The relatives haven't gone through legal channels yet, just mentioned contesting. The author isn't obligated to give it up if the will is legitimate.\n\n2. **Caring for the Aunt**: The author and their family provided care and support over the years. The play aunt was close to them and not to her own relatives. This strengthens the case that the will reflects her true wishes.\n\n3. **Legal Validity**: Unless the relatives can prove the will was invalid (undue influence, lack of mental capacity, etc.), the author has a legal right to the inheritance. The relatives haven't taken legal action yet, so there's no current court order affecting the inheritance.\n\n4. **Moral and Ethical Considerations**: While the author could choose to share out of kindness, they aren't morally obligated to do so. The play aunt's expressed wishes should be respected unless there's a compelling reason not to.\n\n5. **Husband's Advice**: The husband's comment that it's up to the author reinforces the personal choice involved. There's no legal or ethical pressure here except from the relatives' potential contest.\n\nPotential counterarguments: Some might argue that the relatives have a right to challenge the will, but until they do and succeed in court, the author isn't in the wrong. Also, the author's family provided significant support, which aligns with the play aunt's wishes.\n\nConclusion: The author isn't in the wrong. The will is valid, the care provided is a factor, and the relatives haven't legally acted yet. The answer should be B.\n"
